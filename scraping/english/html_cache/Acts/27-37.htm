It suggests a careful accounting, which is consistent with Luke's attention to detail throughout the Acts of the Apostles. This precision underscores the historical reliability of the narrative.<p><b>there were 276:</b><br>The specific number of 276 people on board highlights the size of the group involved in this perilous journey. This number includes both passengers and crew, indicating a significant number of individuals who were part of this voyage. The large number also reflects the capacity of Roman grain ships, which were substantial in size to accommodate such a crowd. This detail aligns with historical records of Roman maritime practices, where ships were often used for transporting grain and could carry hundreds of people.<p><b>of us:</b><br>The use of "us" indicates that the author, Luke, was present on the ship, providing an eyewitness account. This personal involvement adds credibility to the narrative and suggests that the details provided are based on firsthand experience. Luke's presence also highlights his role as a companion of Paul, offering support and documenting the apostle's journey.<p><b>on board:</b><br>This phrase situates the narrative within the context of a sea voyage, a common mode of travel in the ancient Mediterranean world. The mention of being "on board" connects to the broader theme of Paul's missionary journeys, which often involved travel by sea. The Mediterranean Sea was a crucial route for trade and communication, and its unpredictable nature is a backdrop for the events that unfold in this chapter. The journey to Rome is part of Paul's divinely ordained mission, fulfilling God's promise that Paul would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

Earlier, an angel assured Paul, &#8220;God has granted you the lives of all who sail with you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>), setting the stage for a remarkable deliverance that underscores the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in all</b><p>&#8226; The phrase gathers everyone&#8212;soldiers, sailors, prisoners, travelers&#8212;under the same divine promise.<p>&#8226; It echoes the sweep of God&#8217;s care seen in <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4&#8211;16</a>, where pagan sailors are preserved through God&#8217;s intervention.<p>&#8226; No life is incidental to Him who &#8220;desires all men to be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there were</b><p>&#8226; Luke writes as an eyewitness (<a href="/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10&#8211;11</a>), lending precise, journal-like accuracy.<p>&#8226; His matter-of-fact wording invites confidence in the historical reliability of Acts, much as his detailed nativity account builds trust in <a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1&#8211;7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>276</b><p>&#8226; A literal headcount, not a rounded estimate.

As God preserved all 276 through the storm, so He faithfully preserves all who trust His Word today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">And we were in all in the ship . . .</span>--The number is given here, either as a fact that had been omitted before, and was not without its interest, or probably because then for the first time, when they were all gathered at their meal, the writer had taken the pains to count them. A man does not commonly count the number of passengers on board a ship until there is some special occasion, and here it comes naturally as explaining the "all" of the previous verse. It was, we may well imagine, a striking spectacle to see the two hundred and seventy-six all under the influence of one brave and faithful spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We were in all</span>, etc. From the number of persons, two hundred and seventy- six, on board the ship it is calculated that she was of more than five hundred ions burden. The ship in which Josephus was wrecked on his way to Rome, under the procuratorship of Felix (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), carried six hundred souls ('Life,' sect. 3). The ship of Alexandria described by Lucian is calculated to have been of above a thousand tons. The mention of the number brings before us a striking picture of so many persons at St. Paul's bidding, in the midst of so great a danger, taking a cheerful and leisurely meal together, in dependence upon a speedy deliverance promised to them in God s Name. It also adds another vivid touch to the picture of the eye-witness of what he relates. Dean Plumptre well suggests that St. Luke very likely counted the crew on the. occasion of their being all assembled together for the first time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Altogether</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(pasai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
