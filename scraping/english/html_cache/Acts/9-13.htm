The report of it had spread far and wide. The refugees at Damascus told of the sufferings of the brethren at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Thy saints at Jerusalem.</span>--This is noticeable as the first application of the term "saints" to the disciples. The primary idea of the word was that of men who consecrated themselves, and led, in the strictest sense of the word, a devout life. A term of like import had been taken by the more religious Jews in the time of the Maccabeans. The <span class= "ital">Chasidim, </span>or Saints (the word occurs in <a href="/psalms/16-3.htm" title="But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.">Psalm 16:3</a>), were those who banded themselves together to resist the inroads of heathenism under Autiochus Epiphanes. They appear in the books of Maccabees under the title of Assideans (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-42.htm" title="Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law.">1 Maccabees 2:42</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/7-13.htm" title="Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:">1 Maccabees 7:13</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/14-6.htm" title="Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain is Judas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not let the rest be in peace.">2 Maccabees 14:6</a>). The more distinctive name of Pharisees (<span class= "ital">Separatists</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which came to be attached to the more zealous Chasidim, practically superseded this; and either by the disciples themselves, or by friendly outsiders, the Greek equivalent of the old Hebrew word--and probably, therefore, in Palestine, the Aramaic form of the word itself--was revived to describe the devout members of the new society. The fact that their Master had been conspicuously "the Holy One of God" (the same adjective is used of Him in the quotations from <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>, in <a href="/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a>), made it natural that the term should be extended to His followers, just as He had been spoken of as the "Just One" (<a href="/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>); and yet that name was applied, in its Greek form, to James the brother of the Lord, and, in its Latin form of Justus, to the three so named in <a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>; <a href="/acts/18-7.htm" title="And he departed there, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.">Acts 18:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>. It is significant that its first appearance in the New Testament should be as used by the man who was sent to be St. Paul's instructor, and that it should afterwards have been employed so frequently by the Apostle himself (<a href="/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?">1Corinthians 6:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:">2Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The "devout man according to the Law," may well have been among the <span class= "ital">Chasidim</span> even prior to his conversion to the faith of Christ.

Ananias's answer shows his profound astonishment, mixed with doubt and misgiving, at the commission given to him. It shows, too, how the news of Saul's commission had preceded him, and caused terror among the disciples at Damascus. Little did Ananias suspect that this dreaded enemy would be the channel of God's richest blessings to his Church throughout all ages until the coming of Christ. How empty our fears often are l how ignorant are we where our chief good lies hid! But God knows.
