Peter and John, two of Jesus' closest disciples, were sent from Jerusalem to Samaria to confirm the work that Philip had begun. The laying on of hands is a symbolic gesture used throughout Scripture to confer blessing, authority, or the Holy Spirit (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>). It signifies the apostles' role in the early church as leaders and their unique authority to impart the Holy Spirit, which was crucial for the unity and growth of the early Christian community. This act also underscores the importance of apostolic endorsement in the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, as Samaritans were considered outsiders by Jews.<p><b>and they received the Holy Spirit</b><br>The reception of the Holy Spirit is a pivotal moment in the life of a believer and the church. In the context of Acts, this event marks the inclusion of the Samaritans into the body of Christ, fulfilling Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses in "Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." The Holy Spirit's coming upon the Samaritans demonstrates God's acceptance of all people, breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers. This event parallels the Pentecost experience in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit was first given to the Jewish believers, and foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>. Theologically, it emphasizes the necessity of the Holy Spirit for empowerment, guidance, and the assurance of salvation, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his bold proclamation of the gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>Another of Jesus' apostles, often associated with love and deep spiritual insight, and a close companion of Peter in ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritans.htm">Samaritans</a></b><br>The people of Samaria, who had a complex relationship with the Jews, often marked by historical animosity and religious differences.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/laying_on_of_hands.htm">Laying on of Hands</a></b><br>A symbolic act used in the early church to confer blessing, authority, or the Holy Spirit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/receiving_the_holy_spirit.htm">Receiving the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>A significant event in the life of a believer, marking the indwelling presence and empowerment of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_apostolic_authority.htm">The Role of Apostolic Authority</a></b><br>The involvement of Peter and John underscores the importance of apostolic authority in the early church.

Through Peter and John, the Lord visibly knits together Jewish and Samaritan believers, uses the laying on of hands as a sign of unity and blessing, and personally bestows the Holy Spirit on all who have trusted Christ. The verse underscores apostolic authority, the sovereignty of the Spirit&#8217;s timing, and the full inclusion of every believer in the life-giving presence of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Then laid they their hands on them.</span>--The act had already appeared as at once the symbol and the channel of the communication of spiritual gifts and offices in the appointment of the Seven. (See Note on <a href="/acts/6-6.htm" title="Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.">Acts 6:6</a>.) Historically, the act here recorded has the interest of being the starting-point of what afterwards developed into the rite known as Confirmation. Taking the narrative of the Acts by itself, a question might be raised how far what we read of was normal or exceptional, connected, for a time only, with the bestowal of new and marvellous powers, or powerful, through the whole history of the Church, as a means of grace strengthening the spiritual life after those powers had been withdrawn. In any case it was probable that no hard and fast line marked the disappearance of the special and marvellous forms of spiritual power which were at first manifested in connection with the laying-on of hands, and so the practice had time to become part of the fixed order of the Church. When they ceased altogether we can understand the reluctance of men to give up a rite that had come down from the days of the Apostles. They would feel that the prayer of faith was still mighty to prevail; that the Spirit would still be given in answer to prayer joined with the symbolic act, though no longer in the same form, and would confirm and strengthen the work which had been begun in baptism, and so the primitive laying-on of hands passed into Confirmation, and was accompanied by other symbolic acts, such as anointing. The thought that it is so called because in it adults <span class= "ital">confirm</span> the promises made for them when baptised as infants, is entirely modern, and cannot be traced further back than the sixteenth century.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
