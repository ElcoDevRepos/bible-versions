This reflects the Jewish tradition of praising God in the temple and synagogues, as seen in Psalms. Their praise was a response to the mighty works of God, including the resurrection of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This act of worship was central to their community life and mirrored the heavenly worship described in Revelation.<p><b>and enjoying the favor of all the people.</b><br>The early church's communal life, marked by love, generosity, and unity, earned them goodwill among the broader Jewish population in Jerusalem. This favor can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, where believers are called to let their light shine before others. The church's positive reputation was crucial for its growth and acceptance in a society that was often hostile to new movements.<p><b>And the Lord added to their number daily</b><br>The growth of the early church was attributed to divine action rather than human effort. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is the one who gives the increase, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>. The phrase emphasizes the sovereignty of God in salvation and the fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a> that He would build His church.<p><b>those who were being saved.</b><br>Salvation is presented as an ongoing process, not just a one-time event. This reflects the New Testament understanding of salvation as involving justification, sanctification, and future glorification. The phrase also highlights the communal aspect of salvation, as individuals were added to the church, the body of Christ. This echoes the prophetic vision of a restored people of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>This refers to the community of believers in Jerusalem shortly after the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ.
