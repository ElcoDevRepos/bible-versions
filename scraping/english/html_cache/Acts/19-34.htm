The mention of "he was a Jew" refers to Alexander, who was pushed forward by the Jews to make a defense. Jews were often viewed with suspicion in the Greco-Roman world due to their monotheistic beliefs, which clashed with the polytheistic practices of the time. This realization likely heightened the crowd's animosity, as Jews were seen as outsiders who rejected the local deities.<p><b>they all shouted in unison for about two hours</b><br>The crowd's reaction is a testament to the fervent devotion to Artemis in Ephesus. The city was home to the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, which played a central role in the city's identity and economy. The prolonged shouting indicates the intensity of their religious zeal and the influence of the silversmiths, who stirred up the crowd due to economic concerns over the spread of Christianity, which threatened their trade.<p><b>&#8220;Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!&#8221;</b><br>This chant underscores the cultural and religious pride of the Ephesians. Artemis was not only a goddess of fertility and hunting but also a symbol of the city's prosperity and status. The phrase reflects the deep-seated pagan worship that Paul and the early Christians faced as they spread the Gospel. The repetition of this chant for two hours highlights the spiritual blindness and resistance to the message of Christ, reminiscent of the prophets' struggles against idolatry in the Old Testament. This event also foreshadows the challenges the early church would encounter in confronting entrenched pagan practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Paul is central to the events in <a href="/bsb/acts/19.htm">Acts 19</a>.
