Ephesus was a significant city where Paul had previously spent considerable time (<a href="/acts/19.htm">Acts 19:1-10</a>), establishing a strong church. His choice to sail past suggests a deliberate effort to avoid delays, as visiting Ephesus might have required extended engagement with the church and local issues. This decision underscores Paul's focus and determination in his missionary journey.<p><b>to avoid spending time in the province of Asia</b><br>The province of Asia, a Roman administrative region in what is now western Turkey, was an area where Paul had already invested much effort. By avoiding it, Paul demonstrates his awareness of the need to prioritize his time and resources. This decision also highlights the challenges of travel and communication in the ancient world, where journeys were time-consuming and often unpredictable.<p><b>because he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem</b><br>Paul's urgency to reach Jerusalem indicates a strong sense of mission and responsibility. Jerusalem was not only the center of Jewish worship but also the location of the early Christian church's leadership. Paul's desire to be there suggests his commitment to maintaining unity and connection with the broader Christian community. This urgency may also reflect his awareness of the prophetic warnings he had received about the dangers awaiting him in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-23</a>).<p><b>if possible, by the day of Pentecost</b><br>Pentecost, originally a Jewish feast celebrating the harvest and the giving of the Law at Sinai, had gained new significance for Christians as the day the Holy Spirit was poured out on the apostles (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>). Paul's aim to be in Jerusalem by Pentecost suggests his desire to participate in this important celebration, which would have drawn many Jewish and Christian pilgrims to the city. This timing also reflects the early church's continued connection to Jewish traditions and festivals, even as it developed its distinct identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and missionary who is central to the Book of Acts.

What is meant is that he had decided to continue his voyage without going to Ephesus--to pass it by.<p><span class= "bld">To be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span>--The motives for this wish lie on the surface. (1) It was, as has been said in the Note on <a href="/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a>, the Feast that attracted most pilgrims from all parts of the world, and therefore gave most scope for his work as an Apostle, especially for the great task of healing the growing breach between the Jewish and Gentile Christians. (2) It revived the memories and the power of the great day which had been the birthday of the Church's life as a distinct society. (3) St. Paul was contemplating a journey from Syria to Rome after his visit, and that would hardly have been feasible had he waited for the Feast of the Tabernacles. It might have seemed at first as if there was little gained in point of time by sending for the elders to come to him instead of going to them. We must remember, however, that had he taken the journey he would have been exposed to the accidents of travel, perhaps to a fresh riot like that of Demetrius, and might have been detained beyond the day fixed for the departure of the ship.
