In Roman law, certain crimes were punishable by death, and Paul acknowledges the legitimacy of such a penalty if he is truly guilty. This reflects his respect for the rule of law and justice, aligning with biblical principles of accountability (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>).<p><b>I do not refuse to die.</b><br>Paul demonstrates his willingness to accept the consequences if he is indeed guilty, showing his integrity and commitment to truth. This echoes the Christian teaching of being willing to suffer for righteousness' sake (<a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14-17</a>). It also reflects Jesus' own acceptance of His fate for a higher purpose (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p><b>But if there is no truth to their accusations against me,</b><br>Paul asserts his innocence against the false charges. This situation mirrors the false accusations faced by Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>). Paul&#8217;s defense highlights the importance of truth and justice, central themes in both Old and New Testament teachings (<a href="/proverbs/12-17.htm">Proverbs 12:17</a>).<p><b>no one has the right to hand me over to them.</b><br>Paul appeals to his rights as a Roman citizen, which protected him from unjust treatment and ensured a fair trial. This legal protection is significant in the context of Roman governance and law, which provided certain privileges to its citizens (<a href="/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25-29</a>).<p><b>I appeal to Caesar!&#8221;</b><br>By appealing to Caesar, Paul exercises his right to have his case heard by the emperor, a privilege for Roman citizens. This decision is strategic, as it allows Paul to continue his mission to spread the Gospel to the heart of the Roman Empire (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). It also fulfills Jesus' prophecy that Paul would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>), demonstrating God's sovereignty in using legal systems to accomplish His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on trial, asserting his innocence and appealing to Caesar for a fair trial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/festus.htm">Festus</a></b><br>The Roman governor presiding over Paul's trial, who is trying to navigate the political and legal complexities of the situation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesar.htm">Caesar</a></b><br>The Roman Emperor to whom Paul appeals, seeking justice outside the local jurisdiction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders.htm">Jewish Leaders</a></b><br>The accusers of Paul, who are seeking to have him condemned and executed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea.htm">Caesarea</a></b><br>The location where Paul is being held and tried, a significant Roman administrative center.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_injustice.htm">Courage in the Face of Injustice</a></b><br>Paul demonstrates remarkable courage by standing firm in his innocence and using his rights to seek justice.

Theoretically the emperor was but the <span class= "ital">imperator, </span>or commander-in-chief of the armies of the state, appointed by the senate, and acting under its direction. Consuls were still elected every year, and went through the shadowy functions of their office. Many of the provinces (see Notes on <a href="/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>; <a href="/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>), were directly under the control of the senate, and were accordingly governed by proconsuls. But Augustus had contrived to concentrate in himself all the powers that in the days of the republic had checked and balanced the exercise of individual authority. He was supreme pontiff, and as such regulated the religion of the state; permanent censor, and as such could give or recall the privileges of citizenship at his pleasure. The <span class= "ital">Tribunicia potestas, </span>which had originally been conferred on the tribunes of the <span class= "ital">plebs</span> so that they might protect members of their order who appealed to them against the injustice of patrician magistrates, was attached to his office. As such he became the final Court of Appeal from all subordinate tribunals, and so, by a subtle artifice, what had been intended as a safeguard to freedom became the instrument of a centralised tyranny. With this aspect of the matter St. Paul had, of course, nothing to do. It was enough for him that by this appeal he delivered himself from the injustice of a weak and temporising judge, and made his long-delayed journey to Rome a matter of moral certainty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">If</span> <span class="accented">then I am a wrong, doer</span> for <span class="accented">for if I be an offender</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for or, A.V.; <span class="accented">if none of those things is true</span> for <span class="accented">if there be none of these things</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">can give me up</span> for <span class="accented">may deliver me</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I refuse not</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

St. Paul saw at once the danger he was in from Festus's inclination to curry favor with the Jews. With his usual fearlessness, therefore, and perhaps with the same quickness of temper which made him call Ananias "a whited wall," he said, "No man (not even the mighty Roman governor) may make me over to them at their request, to please them," and with the ready wit which characterized him, and with a knowledge of the rights which the <span class="accented">Lex Julia</span>, in addition to other laws, conferred on him as a Roman citizen, he immediately added, I appeal unto Caesar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/25-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
