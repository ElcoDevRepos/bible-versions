The context is post-resurrection, where the disciples are eager to understand the timing of the restoration of the kingdom to Israel. Jesus' reply emphasizes His role as a teacher and guide, redirecting their focus from earthly concerns to spiritual truths.<p><b>It is not for you to know</b><br>Here, Jesus sets a boundary on human understanding, highlighting the limitations of human knowledge concerning divine plans. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>, where the secret things belong to God. It underscores the importance of faith and trust in God's sovereign plan, rather than relying on human understanding.<p><b>times or seasons</b><br>The terms "times" (chronos) and "seasons" (kairos) refer to chronological time and opportune moments, respectively. This distinction is significant in biblical prophecy and eschatology, where God's timing is perfect and often beyond human comprehension. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> also speaks to the appointed times for every purpose under heaven, reinforcing the idea of divine timing.<p><b>that the Father has fixed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and predetermined plan. The use of "fixed" suggests a firm, unchangeable decision by God. It reflects the biblical theme of God's control over history and future events, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning.<p><b>by His own authority</b><br>The authority of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, affirming His ultimate power and control over all creation. This authority is not shared or delegated, highlighting the uniqueness of God's sovereignty. <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus speaks of all authority given to Him, connects to this, showing the divine authority shared within the Trinity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension.

He had already spent forty days teaching them &#8220;about the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), so this response is not a rebuke but a gentle redirection. Throughout His ministry Jesus often clarified expectations&#8212;think of His words on the road to Emmaus (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25-27</a>) and His reminder that Scripture must be fulfilled (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-46</a>). Here, too, He lovingly refocuses their attention from speculation to mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is not for you to know</b><p>Some information simply belongs to God. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a> reminds us, &#8220;The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us.&#8221; Jesus had already said, &#8220;About that day and hour no one knows&#8230; but only the Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>). Paul echoes the same thought: &#8220;Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1-2</a>). The takeaway is humility&#8212;accepting that finite minds cannot grasp every detail of God&#8217;s timetable.<p>&#8226; Instead of chasing hidden knowledge, we lean into what He has clearly told us.<p>&#8226; Knowledge can puff up, but obedience builds up (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>times or seasons</b><p>These two words cover both specific moments and broader eras. Daniel praised God because &#8220;He changes the times and seasons&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> adds, &#8220;To everything there is a season.&#8221; In other words, every historical milestone&#8212;from Pentecost to the future Second Coming&#8212;unfolds according to a divine calendar. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> even links the spread of nations to God&#8217;s preset timing.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan includes both the grand sweep of history and its smallest details.<p>&#8226; Recognizing this frees us from anxiety over world events; they are not random.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the Father has fixed</b><p>Nothing drifts into history by chance; the Father has already &#8220;set a day when He will judge the world with justice&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>). He &#8220;works out everything by the counsel of His will&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a> celebrates this sovereignty: He declares &#8220;the end from the beginning.&#8221; Even apparent delays serve His purposes, just as <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> affirms that the vision will arrive &#8220;at an appointed time.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s appointments cannot be accelerated or postponed by human effort.<p>&#8226; This certainty fuels patient endurance and confident hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by His own authority</b><p>Authority resides in the Father alone, yet is shared with the Son (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>) and expressed through the Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Jesus models perfect submission: &#8220;The Son can do nothing by Himself unless He sees the Father doing it&#8221; (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>). For us, acknowledging that authority means bowing before His decisions without arguing, like clay before the potter (<a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Our task is to trust, not to pry.<p>&#8226; His authority guarantees that promises made are promises kept.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a> teaches that the precise schedule of God&#8217;s kingdom program rests in the Father&#8217;s sovereign hands. Rather than speculate, believers are called to trust His timing, submit to His authority, and stay focused on the mission He immediately assigns (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>). Confidence in His fixed plan fuels faithful obedience in the present while we await the future He has perfectly arranged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons.</span>--The combination of the two words is characteristic of St. Luke and St. Paul (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm" title="But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.">1Thessalonians 5:1</a>). The answer to the eager question touches the season rather than the nature of the fulfilment of their hopes.
