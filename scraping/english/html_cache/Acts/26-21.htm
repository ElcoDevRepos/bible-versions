Paul has been sharing his testimony and the vision he received from Jesus Christ. The "reason" is his preaching of the Gospel, which was seen as controversial and threatening to Jewish religious leaders.<p><b>the Jews</b><br>This term refers to the Jewish religious authorities and leaders who opposed Paul's message. Historically, Paul was a Pharisee and well-versed in Jewish law, which made his conversion and subsequent preaching particularly contentious. The opposition from the Jewish leaders is a recurring theme in Acts, highlighting the tension between early Christians and traditional Jewish beliefs.<p><b>seized me</b><br>Paul's arrest was a result of his preaching, which was perceived as blasphemous and a threat to the Jewish faith. This act of seizing reflects the legal and religious authority the Jewish leaders held in Jerusalem. It also demonstrates the lengths to which they would go to protect their traditions and power.<p><b>in the temple courts</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of their religious identity. The temple courts were areas where teaching and discussions often took place. Paul's presence and preaching in this sacred space would have been seen as provocative, especially given his message about Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>and tried to kill me</b><br>This reflects the severity of the opposition Paul faced. The attempt on his life underscores the intense hostility towards the message of Jesus Christ and the perceived threat it posed to Jewish religious authority. This echoes other instances in Acts where early Christians faced persecution, such as Stephen's martyrdom in <a href="/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>. It also fulfills Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>The apostle who is giving his defense before King Agrippa.

That gospel&#8212;centered on the risen Christ and offered freely to all&#8212;became the immediate cause of the hostility he faced. Similar tension surfaces when he earlier declared, &#8220;I will send you far away to the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>), provoking an uproar (<a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>). Paul&#8217;s message of grace offended those who clung to ethnic and ceremonial distinctions, yet he steadfastly proclaimed it, convinced of its divine origin (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Jews seized me</b><p>Luke notes the ringleaders were representatives of the Jewish religious establishment who &#8220;stirred up the whole crowd&#8221; (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27-30</a>). Their seizure of Paul reflects a pattern: faithful witnesses often face violent opposition from their own people (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>). Still, Paul never stopped loving his kinsmen (<a href="/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1-3</a>); he simply refused to dilute the truth for the sake of peace (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the temple courts</b><p>Ironically, the arrest occurred in the very place designed for worship and sacrificial cleansing.

His presence there exposes the false charge that he despised the temple (<a href="/acts/24-6.htm">Acts 24:6</a>). Instead, the real defilement came from those who misused that sacred space to attack God&#8217;s messenger&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; own rejection within those courts (<a href="/mark/11-15.htm">Mark 11:15-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tried to kill me</b><p>Hatred escalated so quickly that an assassination plot soon followed (<a href="/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12-15</a>).

The verse reminds us that obedience to the risen Lord may invite intense opposition, but His purpose and presence remain unshakable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For these causes . . .</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">on account of these things.</span> With this brief touch, avoiding any elaborate vindication of his own character, St. Paul indicates the real cause of the hostility of the Jews. The one unpardonable sin, in their eyes, was that he taught the Gentiles that they might claim every gift and grace which had once been looked on as the privilege and prerogative of Israel. The historical precedence of the Jew remained (see Notes on <a href="/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a>; <a href="/context/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1-2</a>), but in all essential points they were placed on a footing of equality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - This <span class="accented">cause</span> for <span class="accented">these causes</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">seized</span> for <span class="accented">caught</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">essayed</span> for <span class="accented">went about</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For this cause</span>.
