The "news" refers to the spread of the Gospel and the conversion of Gentiles in Antioch, a significant development as the early church was predominantly Jewish. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and their concern for the spread of the Gospel. Jerusalem, being the site of the temple and the center of Jewish worship, was also the birthplace of the church, making it a natural point of reference for news and decisions.<p><b>they sent Barnabas to Antioch</b><br>Barnabas, whose name means "son of encouragement," was a respected leader in the early church, known for his generosity and support of Saul (Paul) earlier in Acts. His selection to go to Antioch underscores the importance of the mission and the trust the Jerusalem church placed in him. Antioch was a major city in the Roman Empire, known for its cultural diversity and as a center of commerce. The decision to send Barnabas indicates the church's strategic approach to nurturing new believers and ensuring sound teaching. Barnabas's role as an encourager and mediator would have been crucial in bridging cultural divides between Jewish and Gentile believers, reflecting the inclusive nature of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_jerusalem.htm">The Church in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The early Christian community in Jerusalem, which was the center of the nascent Christian movement.

The conduct of the Church in sending so excellent and temperate a person. as Barnabas (as we read in the next verse), the friend of Saul (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>) and a favorer of preaching the gospel to Gentiles (<a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1, 2</a>) to inspect the work at Antioch, is an indication that they had already heard the account of the conversion of Cornelius from the mouth of Peter, and were already led to the conclusion, "Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life!" There is no clue whatever to the length of time that elapsed between the flight from persecution and the arrival at Antioch, except that Saul had had time to sojourn three years in Arabia, to come to Jerusalem, and from thence to go and settle at Tarsus, where Barnabas found him; thus leaving abundant time for Peter's operations in Judaea and Caesarea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/11-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">news</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(logos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3056.htm">Strong's 3056: </a> </span><span class="str2">From lego; something said; by implication, a topic, also reasoning or motive; by extension, a computation; specially, the Divine Expression.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
