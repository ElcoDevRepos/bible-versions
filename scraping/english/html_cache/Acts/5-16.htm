The towns around Jerusalem likely included places like Bethany, Bethlehem, and Jericho, which were within a day's journey. This gathering of crowds signifies the widespread impact of the apostles' ministry and the magnetic draw of the miraculous works being performed. It reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where He instructed the disciples to be His witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea.<p><b>bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits</b><br>The mention of the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits underscores the physical and spiritual afflictions prevalent in the ancient world. Illnesses were often seen as a result of sin or demonic influence, and the presence of unclean spirits indicates a recognition of spiritual warfare. This aligns with Jesus' ministry, where He frequently healed the sick and cast out demons, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>. The apostles, continuing Jesus' work, demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit to bring healing and deliverance.<p><b>and all of them were healed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the completeness and universality of the healing power at work through the apostles. It reflects the compassion and authority of God, as seen in the ministry of Jesus, who healed all who came to Him (<a href="/matthew/12-15.htm">Matthew 12:15</a>). The healing of every individual, regardless of their ailment, serves as a testament to the divine power and authenticity of the apostolic message.

Word spreads, and people flock just as they did to Jesus (<a href="/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>; <a href="/mark/3-7.htm">Mark 3:7-8</a>).<p>- The plural &#8220;crowds&#8221; pictures wave after wave of seekers, showing that God is actively drawing people (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>).<p>- Public interest verifies the authenticity of the miracles. The mighty works are not hidden in a corner (<a href="/acts/26-26.htm">Acts 26:26</a>); they are unfolding where anyone can watch and weigh the evidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the towns around Jerusalem</b><p>- The movement is spilling beyond the city walls. Jesus had told the apostles they would be His witnesses &#8220;in Jerusalem, and in all Judea&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>); this phrase marks the first ripple into Judea&#8217;s villages.<p>- Similar regional awakenings appeared during Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry: &#8220;Large crowds came to Him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-25.htm">Matthew 4:25</a>).<p>- Geography matters here: the gospel is traveling outward exactly as foretold, affirming the reliability of Christ&#8217;s words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bringing the sick</b><p>- Compassion fuels the journey. Families carry loved ones much like the men who lowered their paralyzed friend through a roof to Jesus (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3-4</a>).<p>- The sick understand that the apostolic ministry continues Christ&#8217;s healing power (<a href="/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55-56</a>).<p>- Physical need often opens hearts to spiritual truth; the healings will create opportunities for preaching, as later seen in <a href="/acts/9-34.htm">Acts 9:34-35</a> when an entire region turns to the Lord after Aeneas is healed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those tormented by unclean spirits</b><p>- Scripture treats demonic oppression as real, not metaphorical. Jesus routinely cast out such spirits (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>), and He had given His followers the same authority (<a href="/luke/9-1.htm">Luke 9:1</a>).<p>- Deliverance ministry underscores a cosmic battle (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The kingdom of God is actively pushing back the kingdom of darkness.<p>- Luke highlights both categories&#8212;physical illness and spiritual bondage&#8212;to show the comprehensive reach of Christ&#8217;s salvation (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all of them were healed</b><p>- No partial success rate: &#8220;all&#8221; is emphatic. The Holy Spirit validates the apostles with an unbroken string of genuine miracles (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>).<p>- This widespread healing previews the coming perfection of Christ&#8217;s reign, when sickness and satanic harassment will vanish entirely (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p>- It also confirms <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, &#8220;Surely He took on our infirmities and carried our sorrows,&#8221; fulfilled first in Jesus (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>) and now extended through His body, the church.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-16.htm">Acts 5:16</a> shows a literal, historical surge of people from the surrounding region converging on Jerusalem because the resurrected Christ, working through His apostles, is powerfully healing every kind of affliction. The verse illustrates three truths: the gospel&#8217;s inevitable spread beyond its starting point, Christ&#8217;s compassion for both physical and spiritual misery, and the absolute reliability of His promise to equip His witnesses with confirming signs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">There came also a multitude.</span>--Here also the tense points to a continual and daily concourse.

With regard to what is said in ver. 15 of the shadow of Peter being thought to have had a healing power, it may have been true that it had, as Christ could heal by a shadow as well as by a word or touch, but we cannot say for certain that it was so; anyhow, it was a marvelous season of refreshing to the Church, preparing her for the coming trial. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Crowds</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#8134;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pl&#275;thos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4128.htm">Strong's 4128: </a> </span><span class="str2">A multitude, crowd, great number, assemblage.
