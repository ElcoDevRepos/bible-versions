It highlights a specific moment in Israel's history when they turned away from God despite witnessing His miraculous deliverance and provision.<p><b>they made a calf</b><br>The Israelites crafted a golden calf, an act of idolatry that directly violated the commandments given by God. This event is recorded in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. The calf likely symbolized a deity from Egyptian culture, reflecting the Israelites' struggle to abandon the idolatrous practices they had observed in Egypt.<p><b>and offered a sacrifice to the idol</b><br>The act of offering sacrifices was meant to be a form of worship reserved for God alone. By sacrificing to the calf, the Israelites were engaging in pagan worship practices, which were common in the surrounding cultures. This act demonstrated their rebellion and lack of faith in the God who had delivered them.<p><b>rejoicing in the works of their hands</b><br>This phrase underscores the Israelites' misplaced pride and satisfaction in their own creation rather than in God. It reflects a broader biblical theme where human beings often turn to their own creations or achievements for fulfillment, rather than trusting in God. This is a recurring issue throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>, where idolatry is condemned.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, Stephen is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.
