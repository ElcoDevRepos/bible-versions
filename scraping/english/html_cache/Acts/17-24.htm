It underscores His sovereignty and power, distinguishing Him from the idols worshiped in Athens, which were crafted by human hands. This assertion aligns with <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which declares that the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. The phrase also reflects the monotheistic belief central to Jewish and Christian theology, contrasting with the polytheistic beliefs prevalent in ancient Greek culture.<p><b>is the Lord of heaven and earth</b><br>This statement affirms God's dominion over all creation, both the physical earth and the spiritual realm. It connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>, which acknowledges God's ownership of the heavens and the earth. By declaring God as "Lord," it emphasizes His authority and governance over all things, challenging the Greek pantheon where different gods ruled over different aspects of the world. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the one through whom all things were made (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) and who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>and does not live in temples made by human hands</b><br>This phrase critiques the practice of idol worship and the belief that deities could be contained within man-made structures. It reflects Solomon's acknowledgment in <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a> that even the highest heavens cannot contain God, much less a temple. This idea is further supported by <a href="/isaiah/66.htm">Isaiah 66:1-2</a>, where God declares that heaven is His throne and the earth His footstool. The phrase challenges the Athenians' religious practices, emphasizing that the true God transcends physical structures and human limitations. It also points to the New Testament understanding that believers themselves are the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), indicating a shift from physical temples to a spiritual dwelling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is addressing the people of Athens at the Areopagus, a place known for philosophical discussions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/athens.htm">Athens</a></b><br>A city in Greece known for its rich history in philosophy and religion.

(See Note on <a href="/acts/7-48.htm" title="However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,">Acts 7:48</a>.) As asserted of the Temple at Jerusalem, it had at that time, even though it was quoted from a Jewish prophet, driven the Pharisee Saul into the frenzy of fanaticism. Now, having learnt the lesson as regards that Temple, he proclaims the truth as applicable <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> to all temples raised by human hands. It is obvious that this truth places the sacredness of Christian churches on a ground entirely different from that which influenced the minds of Jew or Greek in regard to their respective temples. Churches are holy, not because God dwells in them, but because they are set apart for the highest acts of the collective life of the congregation of His people. In those acts men hold communion with God, and so the Church is for them all, and more than all, that the Tabernacle of Meeting (this, as meaning the place where man met God, rather than Tabernacle of the Congregation, being the true rendering of the Hebrew term; comp. <a href="/exodus/29-42.htm" title="This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there to you.">Exodus 29:42</a>) was to the Israelites of old. Romish theory and practice, in presenting the consecrated wafer in pyx or monstrance, or carrying it in procession, as an object of adoration, revives the old Pagan view which St. Paul disclaims.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> <span class="accented">- The God</span> for <span class="accented">God</span>, A.V.

St. Paul applies it, too, to the circumcision made with the knife, as distinguished from that wrought by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/3-11.htm">Ephesians 3:11</a>). It is frequent in the LXX. It is a striking instance of St. Paul's unflinching boldness and fidelity to the truth, that he should expose the hollowness of heathen worship, standing within a stone's throw of the Parthenon and the temple of Theseus and the countless other temples of gods and goddesses, which were the pride and glory of the Athenian people. Note how he begins his catechetical instruction to the Athenians with the first article of the Creed: "I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/17-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
