It is historically significant as the place where Jonah attempted to flee from God's command (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). In the New Testament, Joppa is where Peter raised Tabitha (Dorcas) from the dead (<a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36-42</a>). The act of praying indicates Peter's devotion and openness to divine guidance, a common practice among early Christians seeking God's will.<p><b>and in a trance I saw a vision</b><br>The trance state suggests a supernatural experience, often used by God to communicate important messages (<a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a>). Visions are a recurring method of divine revelation in Scripture, seen in the experiences of prophets like Daniel (<a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>) and apostles like Paul (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>). This indicates the importance of the message Peter is about to receive.<p><b>of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners</b><br>The sheet symbolizes the universality of God's message, with the four corners possibly representing the four corners of the earth, indicating the global scope of the Gospel. The descent from heaven signifies divine origin and authority.

It signifies a direct and personal revelation, underscoring Peter's leadership in the early church and his pivotal role in the acceptance of Gentiles. This moment is a turning point, leading to the baptism of Cornelius and his household (<a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-48</a>), fulfilling Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting his vision to the believers in Jerusalem.

Joppa had long been a gateway for God&#8217;s plans to reach the nations. While staying there, &#8220;Peter went up on the roof to pray&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>). Prayer positions the believer to receive divine guidance (<a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>). This opening clause reminds us that God often speaks when His servants intentionally seek Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in a trance</b><p>Acts records several moments when God suspends normal awareness to deliver revelation&#8212;Paul in the temple (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>) or Abram&#8217;s deep sleep (<a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>).

Here, the sheet anticipates the church&#8217;s worldwide mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>being let down from heaven by its four corners</b><p>The origin &#8220;from heaven&#8221; confirms divine initiative (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).

The imagery points to God&#8217;s intent to reach every nation; no corner is excluded. What Peter deemed unclean God was declaring accepted through Christ (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it came right down to me</b><p>God&#8217;s message was personal and direct. The sheet &#8220;came right down&#8221; so Peter could not miss it (<a href="/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14-16</a>). Revelation becomes responsibility: Peter soon applies it by welcoming the Gentile messengers and preaching to Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-48</a>). As <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> promised, the witness moves from Jerusalem outward, and Peter is God&#8217;s chosen instrument for this pivotal step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a> recounts how God broke through Peter&#8217;s prayer time in Joppa with a vivid, heaven-sent vision. Each detail&#8212;the setting of prayer, the trance, the immense sheet, its heavenly descent, and its nearness&#8212;underscores that the inclusion of Gentiles was God&#8217;s sovereign plan, not human innovation.
