The centurion, a commander of approximately 100 soldiers, was a key figure in maintaining order. This reflects the Roman military structure and the respect Paul commanded even while in custody. The presence of centurions in the New Testament often highlights the intersection of Roman authority and the early Christian movement, as seen in other passages like <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Take this young man to the commander;</b><br>The young man referred to here is Paul's nephew, who had overheard a plot against Paul. The term "young man" suggests he was likely a teenager or young adult. The commander, or tribune, was Claudius Lysias, who had authority over the Roman cohort in Jerusalem. This action underscores the importance of family ties and the providence of God in protecting Paul. It also illustrates the strategic use of Roman legal channels by early Christians to ensure justice and safety.<p><b>he has something to tell him.&#8221;</b><br>Paul's request indicates the urgency and seriousness of the situation. The message was about a conspiracy to kill Paul, which highlights the intense opposition he faced from Jewish leaders. This moment is pivotal in the narrative of Acts, as it leads to Paul's eventual transfer to Caesarea and his journey to Rome, fulfilling God's promise that Paul would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). It also demonstrates the theme of divine protection and guidance throughout Paul's ministry, as seen in other instances where God intervenes to preserve His messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is under Roman custody in Jerusalem.

Throughout Acts we see Paul move decisively whenever the Spirit or circumstances demand it (<a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9-10</a>; 19:21). His example reminds us that knowing the danger is not enough; godly wisdom takes the next step without delay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one of the centurions</b><p>Centurions often appear in Scripture as men of integrity&#8212;Cornelius in <a href="/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>, the compassionate officer at the cross in <a href="/mark/15-39.htm">Mark 15:39</a>, and Julius who later protects Paul in <a href="/acts/27-43.htm">Acts 27:43</a>.

His words are direct yet courteous, echoing his earlier respectful defense before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1</a>; 24:10).
