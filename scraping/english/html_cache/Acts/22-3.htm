This declaration connects him to the covenant people of God, tracing back to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It also aligns him with the rich heritage and traditions of the Jewish faith, which are foundational to understanding the fulfillment of the law and the prophets in Jesus Christ.<p><b>born in Tarsus of Cilicia</b><br>Tarsus was a prominent city in the Roman province of Cilicia, known for its cultural and intellectual environment. As a city of considerable importance, Tarsus was a center for learning and philosophy, which may have influenced Paul's intellectual development. This background provided Paul with a unique perspective, blending Jewish heritage with a broader Greco-Roman cultural understanding, which later aided his mission to the Gentiles.<p><b>but raised in this city</b><br>"This city" refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and cultural heart of Judaism. Being raised in Jerusalem would have immersed Paul in the religious life and practices of the Jewish people, including regular participation in temple worship and exposure to the teachings of the Pharisees and other religious leaders. This upbringing would have deeply ingrained in him the traditions and expectations of Jewish law.<p><b>I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel</b><br>Gamaliel was a highly respected Pharisee and a leading authority in the Sanhedrin, known for his wisdom and moderate views. Being educated by Gamaliel indicates that Paul received a rigorous and esteemed education in Jewish law and theology. This training would have equipped Paul with a thorough understanding of the Scriptures and the ability to engage in theological debate, which he later used in his ministry.<p><b>in strict conformity to the law of our fathers</b><br>Paul emphasizes his adherence to the Jewish law, underscoring his commitment to the traditions and commandments handed down through generations. This strict conformity highlights his initial zeal for the law, which he later reinterprets in light of Christ's fulfillment of the law. It also serves to show his transformation from a legalistic understanding to one centered on grace through faith in Jesus.<p><b>I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today</b><br>Paul acknowledges his former zeal, which mirrors the fervor of his audience. This zeal led him to persecute the early Christians, believing he was defending the purity of the Jewish faith. By drawing this parallel, Paul seeks to connect with his audience's passion while illustrating the transformative power of encountering Christ. His statement serves as a bridge to share his testimony of conversion and the true understanding of zeal for God through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul)</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Paul is recounting his background to a Jewish audience.

He affirms the crowd&#8217;s passion (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>) yet hints that zeal needs true knowledge.

Paul&#8217;s story invites us to see how God weaves background, education, and passion into a testimony that points unwaveringly to Jesus as the long-promised Messiah and Savior.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel.</span>--His education may have begun shortly after he became a child of the Law, at the age of twelve.
