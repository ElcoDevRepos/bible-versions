In the cultural context of the early church, the unity and honesty among believers were paramount. The involvement of both Ananias and Sapphira indicates a deliberate and premeditated decision to deceive the apostles and the community. This act of collusion contrasts with the unity and transparency seen in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-37</a>, where believers shared everything they had. The mention of Sapphira's knowledge underscores the seriousness of the sin, as it was not a momentary lapse but a calculated plan.<p><b>He kept back some of the proceeds for himself</b><br>The phrase "kept back" is significant, as it implies an act of embezzlement or misappropriation. The Greek word used here, "nosphizomai," suggests a secretive withholding, which is also used in the Septuagint in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1</a> regarding Achan's sin of keeping spoils from Jericho. This connection highlights the gravity of Ananias's sin, as both instances involve deceit and a breach of trust. The act of keeping back part of the proceeds was not sinful in itself, but the deceit about the total amount given was the issue, reflecting a heart not fully surrendered to God.<p><b>But brought a portion and laid it at the apostles&#8217; feet</b><br>This action was meant to mimic the generosity of other believers, such as Barnabas, who sold land and gave the full amount to the apostles (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36-37</a>). Laying the money at the apostles' feet was a symbolic act of submission and trust, indicating that the funds were to be used for the community's needs. However, Ananias's act was hypocritical, as he sought the appearance of generosity without the genuine sacrifice. This deception threatened the integrity and unity of the early church, which was built on mutual trust and honesty. The apostles, as leaders, were responsible for maintaining the purity and sincerity of the community, making this act of deceit particularly egregious.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ananias.htm">Ananias</a></b><br>A member of the early Christian community who, along with his wife, attempted to deceive the apostles by withholding part of the proceeds from the sale of their property.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sapphira.htm">Sapphira</a></b><br>The wife of Ananias, who was complicit in the deception and fully aware of the plan to keep back some of the money.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles.htm">Apostles</a></b><br>The leaders of the early church in Jerusalem, responsible for distributing resources among the believers and maintaining the integrity of the community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the early church was growing and where this event took place, serving as the center of early Christian activity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Jesus Christ who shared their resources and lived in unity, as described in the preceding chapters of Acts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_stewardship.htm">Integrity in Stewardship</a></b><br>Believers are called to be honest and transparent in their dealings, especially concerning resources entrusted to them by God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Deceit not only affects the individual but can also have repercussions for the entire community of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_accountability.htm">The Role of Accountability</a></b><br>The early church's structure included accountability to one another and to God, a principle that remains vital for the health of the church today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_giving.htm">The Heart of Giving</a></b><br>God values the heart and intention behind our giving more than the amount;

The issue is deception, not percentage.<p>&#8226; Like Achan hiding spoils (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>), Ananias treats sacred funds as personal property, inviting judgment.<p>&#8226; Greed is idolatry (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Serving wealth competes with serving God (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; By retaining part, he effectively reneges on what was implied to be a wholehearted gift, violating the principle of keeping vows (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But brought a portion</b><p>A partial gift masquerades as the whole.<p>&#8226; The couple&#8217;s selective generosity imitates Barnabas&#8217;s full donation in the previous chapter (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36-37</a>) but lacks authenticity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a> condemns offering a blemished sacrifice while claiming it is the best.

Ananias seeks the honor attached to that gesture without matching integrity.<p>&#8226; He presents himself as part of the Spirit-filled movement, yet his heart lies to God (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus cautions against practicing righteousness &#8220;to be seen by men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1-2</a>). The stage and the applause mattered more to Ananias than truth.<p>&#8226; The episode reminds believers that the Spirit still guards the purity of the church (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-2.htm">Acts 5:2</a> exposes a willful, shared deception: husband and wife knowingly reserve a private stash, publicly act as if it is the full price, and place it before the apostles to gain spiritual prestige.
