Achaia was a Roman province in southern Greece, with Corinth as its capital. The role of a proconsul was significant, as they were the chief magistrates of a Roman province, responsible for maintaining law and order. Gallio's tenure is historically verified by an inscription at Delphi, providing a precise chronological anchor for the events in Acts. His reputation for fairness and his philosophical background may have influenced his approach to the case involving Paul.<p><b>the Jews coordinated an attack on Paul</b><br>The Jewish community in Corinth, likely feeling threatened by Paul's success in converting both Jews and Gentiles to Christianity, organized a united effort against him. This reflects the broader pattern of opposition Paul faced from Jewish leaders throughout his missionary journeys, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> and <a href="/acts/17-5.htm">Acts 17:5</a>. The term "coordinated" suggests a premeditated and collective action, indicating the seriousness of their intent to stop Paul's ministry.<p><b>and brought him before the judgment seat</b><br>The "judgment seat," or "bema," was a raised platform in the agora (marketplace) of Corinth where officials would hear legal cases. This public setting was intended to shame Paul and discredit his message. The bema in Corinth has been excavated, providing a tangible connection to this biblical event. The act of bringing Paul before the judgment seat mirrors the trials faced by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>) and foreshadows the trials of early Christians, emphasizing the theme of suffering for the faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gallio.htm">Gallio</a></b><br>The proconsul of Achaia during this time.

Far from hindering the gospel, each event fulfills Jesus&#8217; promise that His witnesses will testify before rulers, and it confirms that no human scheme can thwart God&#8217;s plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia.</span>--"Deputy" stands, as before (see Note on <a href="/acts/13-7.htm" title="Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.">Acts 13:7</a>), for "proconsul." Here, also, St. Luke shows his characteristic accuracy in the use of official titles. Achaia, which included the whole of Greece south of the province of Macedonia, had been an imperial province under Tiberius (Tacitus, <span class= "ital">Ann.</span> i. 76), and had been governed by a praetor, but had been recently, in the same year as the expulsion of the Jews from Rome, restored to the senate by Claudius, as no longer needing direct military control (Suetonius, <span class= "ital">Claud.</span> c. 25). Gallio, or to give his full name, M. Annaeus Novatus, who had taken the <span class= "ital">agnomen</span> of Gallio on his adoption by the rhetorician of that name, was the brother of L. Annaeus Seneca, the tutor of Nero. The philosopher dedicated to him two treatises on Anger and the Blessed Life; and the kindliness of his nature made him a general favourite. He was everybody's "dulcis Gallio," was praised by his brother for his disinterestedness and calmness of temper, as one "who was loved much, even by those who had but little capacity for loving" (Seneca, <span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 104). On the whole, therefore, we may see in him a very favourable example of what philosophic culture was able to do for a Roman statesman. On the probable connection of the writer of the Acts with his family, see <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Gospel of St. Luke.</span><p><span class= "bld">Made insurrection . . . against Paul.</span> Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">rose up against, </span>or <span class= "ital">rushed upon, </span>our word "insurrection" having acquired the special meaning of a revolt of subjects against rulers.<p><span class= "bld">And brought him to the judgment</span> <span class= "bld">seat.</span>--The habit of the Roman governors of provinces was commonly to hold their court in the <span class= "ital">agora, </span>or marketplace on certain fixed days (see Note on <a href="/acts/19-38.htm" title="Why if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another.">Acts 19:38</a>), so that any one might appeal to have his grievance heard. Gallio was now so sitting, and the Jews, having probably preconcerted their plans, took advantage of the opportunity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">with one accord rose</span> up for <span class="accented">made insurrection with one accord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. Gallio. Marcus Annaeus Novatus took the name of Lucius Junius Annaeus Gallio, on account of his adoption by L. Junius Gallio. He was the elder brother of Seneca, and a man of ability, and of a most amiable temper and disposition. His brother Seneca said that he had not a fault, and that everybody loved him. He was called "Dulcis Gallio" by Statius. It is unfortunately not known exactly in what year Gallio became either Consul or Proconsul of Achaia. Had it been known, it would have been invaluable for fixing the chronology of St. Paul's life. Lewin puts it (his proconsulate) in the year A.D. , and so does Renan; Howson, between A.D. and A.D. . The circumstantial evidence from secular writers corroborating St. Luke's account is exceedingly curious. There is no account extant either of his consulate or of his proconsulate of Achaia. But Pithy, speaking of the medicinal effect of a sea-voyage on persons in consumption, gives as an example, "as I remember was the case with Annaeus Gallio after his consulate," and seems to imply that he went to Egypt for the sake of the long sea-voyage; which would suit very well his going there from his government in Achaia (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 31. cap. 6:33). And that his proconsulate was in Achaia is corroborated by a chance quotation in Seneca's Epistle 104, of a saying of "my lord Gallio, when ha had a fever <span class="accented">in Achaia</span> and immediately went on board ship," where the phrase "domini met," applied to his own brother, seems also to indicate his high rank. Profane history also shuts up the probable date of Gallio's proconsulate between the year A.D. and the year A.D. or 66, in which he died. There is a diversity of accounts as to his death. Ernesti, in his note on Tacitus, 'Auual.,' 15. 73, where Tacitus speaks of him as frightened at the death of his brother Seneca, and a suppliant for his own life, says, "quem Nero post interfecit," and refers to Dion Cassius, 58,18, and Eusebius. But Dion is there speaking of Junius Gallio in the reign of Tiberius, not of our Gallio at all; though afterwards, speaking of the death of Seneca, he says, "and his brothers also were killed after him "(62, 25). As for Eusebius, the passage quoted is not found in the Greek or Armenian copies of the 'Chronicon,' but only in the Latin of Jerome. But, as Scaliger points out, there is a manifest blunder here, because the 'Chronicon ' places the death of Gallio two years before that of Seneca, whereas we know from Tacitus that Gallio was alive after his brother's death. Moreover, the description "egregius declamator" clearly applies to Junius Gallio the rhetorician, and not to Gallio his adopted son. Though, therefore, Renan says, "Comme son frere il eut l'honneur sous Neron d'expier par, la mort sa distinction et son honnetete" ('St. Paul,' p. 222), if we give duo weight to the silence of Tacitus, it is very doubtful whether he died a violent death at all. St. Luke, as usual, is most accurate in calling him proconsul. Achaia had been recently made a senatorial province by Claudius.
