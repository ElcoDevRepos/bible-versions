Known for its maritime prowess, Phoenicia was a hub of trade and commerce. The mention of a ship crossing to Phoenicia indicates the strategic importance of this route for travel and trade. The Apostle Paul, on his missionary journeys, often utilized established trade routes to spread the Gospel, demonstrating the providential use of existing infrastructure for the advancement of God's kingdom. This journey reflects the interconnectedness of the ancient world and the spread of Christianity through these networks.<p><b>we boarded it</b><br>The act of boarding the ship signifies a deliberate decision to continue the mission despite potential challenges. In the context of Acts, Paul is resolute in his purpose to reach Jerusalem, even though he is aware of the dangers that await him. This determination is reminiscent of Jesus' own journey to Jerusalem, where He faced suffering and crucifixion. Paul's actions here can be seen as a type of Christ, willingly facing hardship for the sake of the Gospel. The boarding of the ship also highlights the communal aspect of Paul's ministry, as he often traveled with companions, emphasizing the importance of fellowship and support in Christian ministry.<p><b>and set sail</b><br>Setting sail marks the beginning of a new phase in Paul's journey, symbolizing movement and transition. In biblical literature, the sea often represents both opportunity and danger, a place of uncertainty where faith is tested. Paul's willingness to set sail despite the risks reflects his trust in God's sovereignty and guidance. This act of setting sail can be paralleled with other biblical narratives where faith leads to action, such as Abraham's journey to an unknown land or Peter stepping out of the boat to walk on water. It underscores the theme of obedience and reliance on God's direction in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his missionary journey, heading towards Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/phoenicia.htm">Phoenicia</a></b><br>A region along the eastern Mediterranean coast, known for its maritime trade and seafaring culture.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/ship.htm">Ship</a></b><br>The mode of transportation used by Paul and his companions to travel across the Mediterranean Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/companions.htm">Companions</a></b><br>Although not named in this verse, Paul often traveled with fellow believers and co-workers in the ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/set_sail.htm">Set Sail</a></b><br>The act of beginning a journey by sea, indicating movement and transition in Paul's missionary work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_mission.htm">Commitment to God's Mission</a></b><br>Paul's determination to reach Jerusalem despite potential dangers exemplifies unwavering commitment to God's calling.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Boarding a ship to Phoenicia required trust in God's provision for safe passage and guidance, reminding us to trust God in our journeys.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning_in_ministry.htm">Strategic Planning in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul's travel plans were strategic, showing the importance of planning and preparation in fulfilling God's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_in_ministry.htm">Community in Ministry</a></b><br>Traveling with companions highlights the value of community and support in ministry endeavors.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_engagement.htm">Cultural Engagement</a></b><br>Traveling to diverse regions like Phoenicia shows the importance of engaging with different cultures to spread the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_21_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_21_2_God_s_guidance_for_Paul.htm">How does Acts 21:2 demonstrate God's guidance in Paul's missionary journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Paul_s_obedience_in_Acts_21_2.htm">What can we learn from Paul's obedience to God's direction in Acts 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_21_2_s_link_to_divine_guidance.htm">How does Acts 21:2 connect with other instances of divine guidance in Acts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_guidance_like_Paul_2.htm">How can we seek God's direction in our daily decisions like Paul did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Faith_s_role_in_God_s_path_Acts_21_2.htm">What role does faith play in following God's path as seen in Acts 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_21_2_s_role_in_Paul_s_missions.htm">What significance does Acts 21:2 have in understanding Paul's missionary journeys?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_21_2_Sea_travel_s_historical_accuracy.htm">How does Acts 21:2 reflect the historical accuracy of sea travel in the ancient world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Paul_s_Phoenicia_trip_theological_impact.htm">What theological implications arise from Paul's decision to sail to Phoenicia in Acts 21:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_apostle_thomas_travel_to_india.htm">Did Apostle Thomas travel to India?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_paul's_safety_claims_defy_storm_deaths.htm">In Acts 27:22-26, do Paul's assurances of safety contradict typical maritime fatalities in storms of that era?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_paul's_ritual_conflict_with_faith_alone.htm">Acts 21:17-26 - Does Paul's participation in Jewish purification rituals conflict with the New Testament teaching on salvation by faith alone?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'born_of_the_spirit'_mean.htm">What role did Cyprus play in biblical events?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Acts 21:2 Mean</div><b>Finding a ship</b><p>&#8220;Finding a ship&#8221;

The ship in which St. Paul and his companions had hitherto sailed was probably a coasting-vessel, intending to continue its course all along the south coast of Asia Minor. But at Patara they found a ship on the point of sailing across the open sea direct to Tyre, by which the voyage would be shortened many days. They accordingly immediately took their passage by it, and put out to sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 1, note).
