This attention reflects the human tendency to be drawn to the supernatural, often without discernment. In biblical context, this mirrors the Israelites' frequent attraction to pagan practices and false prophets, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>, where God warns against following signs and wonders that lead away from Him.<p><b>because he had astounded them</b><br>Simon's ability to perform wonders left the people amazed, suggesting that his acts were beyond ordinary human capability. This astonishment can be compared to the reaction of the crowds to Jesus' miracles, as seen in <a href="/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>. However, unlike Jesus, Simon's acts were not from God, highlighting the importance of discerning the source of spiritual power.<p><b>for a long time</b><br>The duration of Simon's influence suggests a deep-rooted presence in the community, indicating that his sorcery was not a fleeting phenomenon. This long-term impact can be compared to the persistent influence of false teachings and idolatry in Israel's history, as seen in the repeated cycles of apostasy in the Book of Judges.<p><b>with his sorcery</b><br>Sorcery, or magic, was condemned in the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as it often involved invoking demonic powers. Simon's practices would have been seen as an abomination to God, contrasting with the true power of the Holy Spirit demonstrated by the apostles.

This wasn&#8217;t casual curiosity; it was focused allegiance.<p>&#8226; Like the crowds who &#8220;paid close attention to what Philip said&#8221; when he arrived with the gospel (<a href="/acts/8-6.htm">Acts 8:6</a>), attention is the first step toward either truth or deception.<p>&#8226; Scripture often warns that who we listen to shapes who we become (<a href="/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The text underscores how easily an audience can be formed around the spectacular instead of the truthful (cf. <a href="/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he had astounded them</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;because he had astounded them&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Astounded&#8221; describes a jaw-dropping amazement. Simon&#8217;s feats weren&#8217;t minor parlor tricks; they left the crowd staggered.<p>&#8226; Luke previously said Simon &#8220;bewitched the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great&#8221; (<a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>). His own self-promotion merged with their astonishment.<p>&#8226; False wonders have long swayed hearts: Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians mimicked Moses (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>), and Paul speaks of &#8220;false signs and wonders&#8221; that accompany lawlessness (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Astonishment alone is never a safe guide. Even believers can be impressed for the wrong reasons, as when Paul cautions Corinth about &#8220;another Jesus&#8221; proclaimed with persuasive style (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-4.htm">2 Corinthians 11:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a long time</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for a long time&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Deception gains power through duration. Weeks become months, months become years, and lies settle like concrete.<p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s extended run suggests an entrenched spiritual stronghold. Long exposure can normalize what once felt shocking (cf. <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a> on the hardening effect of sin&#8217;s deceit).<p>&#8226; Persistent influence is why Scripture urges vigilance: &#8220;See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; When Philip later arrives, the contrast between years of sorcery and the sudden clarity of the gospel is stark (<a href="/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with his sorcery</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;with his sorcery.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The word signals occult practices&#8212;attempts to tap supernatural power apart from God.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law is explicit: &#8220;Let no one be found among you&#8230;who practices divination or sorcery&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). The Samaritans were flirting with what God calls detestable.<p>&#8226; Sorcery is listed among &#8220;the acts of the flesh&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>) and brings eternal judgment when unrepented (<a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Simon&#8217;s mastery of the occult produced real effects, yet they were ultimately counterfeit&#8212;unable to save, heal, or transform hearts as Philip&#8217;s Spirit-empowered ministry soon would (<a href="/acts/8-7.htm">Acts 8:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-11.htm">Acts 8:11</a> shows a community mesmerized by Simon&#8217;s long-running occult show. Their concentrated attention flowed from spectacular astonishment, cemented over time, and rooted in forbidden sorcery. The verse warns that impressive power divorced from God&#8217;s truth can hold people captive for years. Only the gospel Philip preached would break that spell, proving that true deliverance comes not through dazzling wonders but through the authentic power of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And to him they had regard.</span>--The Greek word is the same as in the "gave heed" of the previous verse.
