Alexandrian ships were large grain ships from Egypt, a major supplier of grain to Rome. These ships were known for their size and sturdiness, often used for long voyages across the Mediterranean. The mention of an Alexandrian ship highlights the importance of Egypt in the Roman economy and the interconnectedness of the Roman Empire.<p><b>sailing for Italy</b><br>Italy, specifically Rome, was the destination for Paul as he was to stand trial before Caesar. This journey to Italy is significant as it fulfills God's promise to Paul that he would testify in Rome (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). The route from Alexandria to Italy was a common trade route, emphasizing the strategic and economic importance of this journey. The voyage also symbolizes the spread of the Gospel to the heart of the Roman Empire, aligning with the Great Commission to spread the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>and put us on board</b><br>The use of "us" indicates that the author of Acts, Luke, was present with Paul on this journey, providing an eyewitness account. This inclusion of Luke and possibly other companions like Aristarchus (<a href="/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>) highlights the communal aspect of early Christian missions. The act of boarding the ship signifies the beginning of a perilous journey, reflecting the trials and tribulations faced by early Christians in spreading the Gospel. This moment also foreshadows the challenges and divine interventions that will occur during the voyage, illustrating God's providence and protection over His servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers.

This may have been owing to the prevalence of the westerly winds already noticed. The Alexandrian traders, however, as a rule, avoided taking the course along the coast of Africa, through fear of the quicksands of the great Syrtis, and took that between Crete and the Peloponnesus. The presence of this merchantship led to a change of plan. It seemed an easier and more expeditious route to go straight to Rome, instead of landing at Mysia, and then taking another ship to Macedonia in order to journey by land to the coast of the Adriatic. A local inscription describes Myra as a "horrea," or store-house of corn (Lewin's <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>ii. p. 187), and the Alexandrian ship may therefore have gone thither to discharge part of its cargo. It has been assumed, but on insufficient grounds, that Aristarchus here parted from St. Paul, and went on in the Adramyttium ship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- For</span>, for <span class="accented">into</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He put us therein</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament, and once in the LXX.
