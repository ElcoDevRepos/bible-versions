The "signs and wonders" serve as divine validation of the apostles' message and authority. In the Jewish context, such miracles were seen as evidence of God's presence and approval. This echoes the Old Testament, where prophets like Moses and Elijah performed miracles to confirm their divine mission (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>). The apostles' ability to perform miracles also fulfills Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a> that His followers would do greater works.<p><b>and with one accord the believers gathered together</b><br>The phrase "with one accord" emphasizes the unity and harmony among the early Christians. This unity is a recurring theme in Acts (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14, 2</a>:46, 4:24), reflecting the communal life and shared purpose of the early church. Such unity was crucial for the church's growth and resilience in the face of external opposition. It also fulfills Jesus' prayer for unity among His followers in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>. The gathering of believers signifies the importance of fellowship and collective worship in the early Christian community.<p><b>in Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade</b><br>Solomon's Colonnade, also known as Solomon's Porch, was a covered walkway on the eastern side of the Temple in Jerusalem. It was a significant location for teaching and gathering, as it provided shelter and space for large groups. This area is mentioned several times in the New Testament (<a href="/john/10-23.htm">John 10:23</a>, <a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>), indicating its importance as a meeting place for Jesus and the early church. The choice of this location underscores the continuity between Jewish tradition and the emerging Christian faith, as the apostles preached in a place deeply rooted in Jewish history and worship. Solomon's Colonnade symbolizes the transition from the old covenant to the new, with the apostles proclaiming the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles.htm">The Apostles</a></b><br>The primary leaders of the early church, chosen by Jesus, who were empowered by the Holy Spirit to spread the Gospel and perform miracles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by the apostles, serving as evidence of God's power and the truth of the Gospel message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The broader community, including both believers and non-believers, who witnessed the apostles' miracles and were impacted by their ministry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>The early Christian community, united in faith and purpose, who gathered regularly for worship, teaching, and fellowship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_colonnade.htm">Solomon&#8217;s Colonnade</a></b><br>A covered area in the Temple complex in Jerusalem, where the early Christians often met.

On "with one accord," see Note on <a href="/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the hands of the apostles,</span> etc. Two things are here remarkable. The one that Christianity at its beginnings was mightily helped and advanced by miracles done in the Name of Jesus Christ. The other that the authority of the apostles as the rulers of the Church was greatly strengthened by these miracles being wrought exclusively by their hands. We cannot understand either the external relations of the Church to the world, or the internal relations of the people to their spiritual rulers, unless we duly take count of these two things. <span class="cmt_word">With one accord</span> (see <a href="/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a>, note). In Solomon's porch (see <a href="/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>, note). It is quite true to nature that Solomon's porch, having been the scene of the miracle, became the place of frequent concourse. There is a difference of opinion among commentators as to whether the <span class="accented">all</span> refers to the whole Christian laity as in <a href="/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>, or to the apostles only. Alford thinks the latter, Meyer the former. The opinion that the whole body of Christians is meant seems most probable, both from the use of the words in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. I and from the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (especially in connection with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), which seems more applicable to a mixed multitude than to twelve colleagues like the apostles. You could hardly say that all the queen's ministers met in a Cabinet Council with one accord.
