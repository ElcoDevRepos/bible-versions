It highlights the sincerity and intensity of his beliefs as a Pharisee. Paul, originally named Saul, was deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and law, which shaped his initial opposition to the early Christian movement. His conviction was not based on ignorance but on a zealous adherence to the Jewish faith, which he believed was being threatened by the teachings of Jesus.<p><b>that I ought to do all I could</b><br>Paul's sense of duty and obligation is evident here. His actions were driven by a strong sense of responsibility to protect the Jewish faith from what he perceived as heretical teachings. This phrase underscores the lengths to which Paul was willing to go, including persecution and imprisonment of Christians, as seen in <a href="/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a> and <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>. His zeal is comparable to that of Phinehas in <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, who acted out of zeal for God's honor.<p><b>to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</b><br>The "name of Jesus of Nazareth" signifies not just the person of Jesus but His authority, teachings, and the movement that followed Him. Nazareth, a town in Galilee, was often looked down upon (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>), yet it became central to Jesus' identity. Paul's opposition was not merely against a group of people but against the very foundation of the Christian faith. This opposition is a fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a>, where He warned His disciples of persecution for His name's sake. Paul's transformation from persecutor to apostle is a powerful testament to the transformative power of Christ, as later detailed in <a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus)</a></b><br>A Pharisee and zealous persecutor of Christians who later became a devoted apostle of Jesus Christ.
