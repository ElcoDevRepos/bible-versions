This phrase indicates the dynamic and unstoppable nature of God's word, echoing <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which promises that God's word will not return void. The spread of the word signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses in Jerusalem and beyond. The Holy Spirit empowered the apostles, leading to the rapid dissemination of the gospel message.<p><b>The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly,</b><br>Jerusalem, the epicenter of Jewish religious life, was where the church began. The rapid growth of disciples highlights the effectiveness of the apostles' ministry and the work of the Holy Spirit. This growth fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a> about the outpouring of the Spirit. The term "disciples" refers to those who followed the teachings of Jesus, indicating a deep commitment to the new faith. The growth also reflects the communal life and witness of the early believers as described in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>.<p><b>and a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.</b><br>The conversion of priests is significant, as they were part of the religious establishment often resistant to Jesus' message. Their obedience to the faith suggests a recognition of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah. This shift among the priests may have been influenced by the apostles' teaching and the miracles performed, which validated the message of Jesus as the Christ. The priests' conversion also underscores the power of the gospel to transcend social and religious barriers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_word_of_god.htm">The Word of God</a></b><br>Refers to the message of the Gospel, the teachings of Jesus Christ, and the Scriptures that were being preached by the apostles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_in_jerusalem.htm">Disciples in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The early followers of Jesus who were based in Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and the birthplace of the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who served in the temple.

Just as <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> promises that the word will not return void, here we see that promise unfolding in real time.<p>&#8226; The apostles had just resolved the dispute over food distribution (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>). With spiritual and practical distractions removed, the gospel could move forward unhindered&#8212;mirroring Paul&#8217;s request in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a> &#8220;that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The narrative confirms the divine origin and power of Scripture: when proclaimed faithfully, it always produces fruit (<a href="/acts/12-24.htm">Acts 12:24</a>; <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>b)<p>&#8226; Luke&#8217;s focus on &#8220;disciples,&#8221; not mere converts, shows genuine life-change.

The pattern signals God&#8217;s direct blessing on a church devoted to prayer, the apostles&#8217; teaching, fellowship, and the breaking of bread (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Rapid multiplication also fulfills <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, beginning &#8220;in Jerusalem.&#8221; The gospel&#8217;s expansion here provides the launching pad for its spread to Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A great number of priests became obedient to the faith</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;And a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-7.htm">Acts 6:7</a>c)<p>&#8226; Priests served at the temple and were steeped in Old Testament ritual.

The fact stated implies more than the increase of numbers specified in the next clause. The "word of God" is here the whole doctrine of Christ as preached by the Apostles, and, we must now add, by the Seven who are commonly known as Deacons, and there was, as the sequel shows, at this stage, what we have learnt to call an expansion and development of doctrine.<p><span class= "bld">A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</span>--The fact is every way significant. No priest is named as a follower of our Lord's. None, up to this time, had been converted by the Apostles. The new fact may fairly be connected with the new teaching of Stephen. And the main feature of that teaching was, as we shall see, an anticipation of what was afterwards proclaimed more clearly by St. Paul and (if we assign the Epistle to the Hebrews to its probable author) by Apollos: that the time for sacrifices had passed away, and that the Law, as a whole, and the ritual of the Temple in particular, were decaying and waxing old, and ready to vanish away (<a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>). We might have thought this likely to repel the priests, and to rouse them to a fanatic frenzy. We find that it attracts them as nothing else had attracted. To them, it may well have been, that daily round of a ritual of slaughtered victims and clouds of incense, the cutting-up of the carcases and the carriage of the offal, had become unspeakably wearisome. They felt how profitless it was to their own spiritual life, how little power there was in the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-4.htm" title="For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.">Hebrews 10:4</a>). Their profession of the new faith did not necessarily involve the immediate abandonment of their official function; but they were drifting to it as to a not far-off result, and were prepared to meet it without misgiving, perhaps with thankfulness, when it became inevitable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Exceedingly</span> for <span class="accented">greatly</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Were obedient to the faith.</span> Compare the phrase, obedience of faith or "to the faith" (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>).
