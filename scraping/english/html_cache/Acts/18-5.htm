Their arrival from Macedonia is significant as it marks a transition in Paul's ministry in Corinth. Macedonia, a region in Northern Greece, was where Paul had previously established churches in cities like Philippi and Thessalonica. The arrival of Silas and Timothy likely brought encouragement and possibly financial support, as suggested in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>, allowing Paul to focus more on his ministry. This moment underscores the importance of teamwork and support in early Christian missions.<p><b>Paul devoted himself fully to the word</b><br>Paul's dedication to the word indicates a shift from his tent-making work to full-time ministry. This devotion highlights the priority of preaching and teaching in Paul's mission. The "word" refers to the gospel message, which Paul was committed to spreading. This phrase emphasizes the importance of the proclamation of the gospel as central to the mission of the early church. Paul's commitment serves as a model for Christian ministry, demonstrating the need for focus and dedication in spreading the message of Christ.<p><b>testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ</b><br>Paul's primary audience in the synagogues was the Jewish community. His testimony that "Jesus is the Christ" is a declaration that Jesus is the Messiah, the anointed one prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures. This message was central to Paul's preaching, as he sought to show that Jesus fulfilled the messianic prophecies found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. The term "Christ" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew "Messiah," and Paul's insistence on this point was often met with resistance, as seen in other parts of Acts. This phrase underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments and the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key apostle in the early church, known for his missionary journeys and epistles.

Their arrival brings at least two immediate blessings:<p>&#8226; &#8203;Fresh encouragement. Paul had faced sharp resistance in Athens and Corinth; the presence of trusted coworkers replenishes his spirit (cf. <a href="/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8203;Material provision. The Macedonian churches send financial support through them (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>), freeing Paul from tentmaking so he can focus entirely on ministry.<p>The moment reminds us that God often uses fellow believers to supply what is lacking&#8212;whether strength, companionship, or resources (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Paul devoted himself fully to the word</b><p>With his hands no longer occupied in daily labor, Paul gives his undivided attention to preaching and teaching.<p>&#8226; &#8203;This models the rightful priority of the Word: &#8220;We will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8203;It underscores the legitimacy of gospel workers receiving support so they can labor without distraction (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8203;It displays Paul&#8217;s single-minded calling: &#8220;Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>).<p>The text invites believers to examine how God may be calling them to greater focus&#8212;whether vocationally or through setting aside lesser pursuits&#8212;so that Scripture shapes every part of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ</b><p>Paul&#8217;s message remains crystal-clear: Jesus of Nazareth is the long-promised Messiah.<p>&#8226; &#8203;He reasons from the Scriptures, just as he did in Thessalonica, &#8220;explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-3.htm">Acts 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8203;His testimony fulfills his God-given pattern: &#8220;To the Jew first&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), offering covenant promises before turning to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8203;The content is unapologetically Christ-centered: &#8220;We proclaim to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers&#8221; (<a href="/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>).<p>For modern readers, the verse affirms that evangelism is not a vague spirituality but a clear, Scripture-based presentation that Jesus is the only Savior (<a href="/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> shows how God supplies His servants&#8212;through supportive friends, financial help, and renewed focus&#8212;so the gospel can go forward without compromise. Paul&#8217;s full devotion to Scripture and bold witness that &#8220;Jesus is the Christ&#8221; form a timeless example: strengthened by the fellowship of believers, we give ourselves wholly to God&#8217;s Word and make Christ known with clarity and confidence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia.</span>--We learn from <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm" title="Why we would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.">1Thessalonians 2:18</a>, that the latter had come to St. Paul at Athens, but had been almost immediately sent back to Thessalonica to bring further news about the converts, for whose trials the Apostle felt so much sympathy and anxiety. They brought a good report of their faith and love (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1Thessalonians 3:6</a>), possibly also fresh proofs of their personal regard, and that of the Philippians, in the form of gifts (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). This may, however, refer to a later occasion. The First Epistle to the Thessalonians was probably sent back by the brethren who had accompanied Silas and Timotheus on their journey to Corinth. The reader will note the parallelism (1) between the passage in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, which treats of the Second Advent, with the teaching of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, and (2) between the few words as to spiritual gifts, in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm" title="Quench not the Spirit.">1Thessalonians 5:19-21</a>, with the fuller treatment of the same subject in 1 Corinthians 12-14. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Timothy</span> for <span class="accented">Timotheus</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">came down</span> for <span class="accented">were come down</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">constrained by the Word</span> for <span class="accented">pressed in spirit</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">testifying</span> for <span class="accented">and testified</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the Christ</span> for <span class="accented">Christ</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When Silas and Timothy</span>, etc. It is probable that Silas had returned by St. Paul's directions to Beraea, and Timothy to Thessalonica from Athens. If there were extant a letter of Paul to the Beraeans, it would probably mention his sending back Silas to them, just as the Epistle to the Thessalonians mentions his sending Timothy to them. Now they both come to Corinth from <span class="accented">Macedonia</span>, which includes Beraea and Thessalonica. If they came by sea, they would probably sail together from Dium to Cenchreae (see <a href="/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Was constrained by the Word</span>. As an English phrase, this is almost destitute of meaning. If the R.T. is right, and it has very strong manuscript authority, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> mean that he was seized, taken possession of, and as it were bound by the necessity of preaching the Word, constrained as it were to preach more earnestly than ever. In St. Luke <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a medical term: in <a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28</a>, R.T., "Holden with a great fever;" <a href="/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>, "Holden with a great fear;" <a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>, "Sick of fever and dysentery;" and so frequently in medical writers ('Medical Language of St. <span class="accented">Luke</span>,' Hobart). But it is worth considering whether <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> is not in the middle voice, with the sense belonging to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "continuous," "unbroken," and so that the phrase means that, after the arrival of Silas and Timothy, St. Paul gave himself up to continuous preaching. St. Luke has not infrequently a use of words peculiar to himself. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">instabat verbo</span>, seems so to understand it. It was probably soon after the arrival of Silas and Timothy that St. Paul wrote his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, 6</a>).
