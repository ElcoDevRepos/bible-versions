Pilate was the Roman governor who ultimately authorized Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-16.htm">John 19:16</a>). Their involvement highlights the political tension and fulfillment of God's sovereign plan.<p><b>conspired with the Gentiles and the people of Israel</b><br>This phrase underscores the unity of diverse groups in opposition to Jesus. The Gentiles, represented by the Romans, and the people of Israel, represented by Jewish leaders, both played roles in Jesus' death.

Jesus' holiness and servanthood are central to His mission and identity.<p><b>whom You anointed</b><br>Anointing signifies being chosen and empowered by God for a specific purpose. Jesus is the Anointed One, or Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as those in <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-26</a>.
