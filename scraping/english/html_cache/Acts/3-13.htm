It highlights the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, where God promises Abraham that all nations will be blessed through his offspring. This connection underscores the legitimacy of the Christian message to a Jewish audience, affirming that Jesus is the fulfillment of the covenant made with their ancestors.<p><b>the God of our fathers</b><br>This phrase reinforces the communal and historical identity of the Jewish people. It emphasizes that the God who acted in the past is the same God who is acting in the present through Jesus. This continuity is crucial for understanding the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>, where God identifies Himself as the God of the patriarchs to Moses, linking the past with the present mission.<p><b>has glorified His servant Jesus</b><br>The term "servant" is significant, as it echoes the "Servant Songs" of Isaiah, particularly <a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53</a>:12, which describe a suffering servant who will be exalted. This connection highlights Jesus as the prophesied servant who suffers and is glorified, fulfilling the messianic expectations. The glorification of Jesus is seen in His resurrection and ascension, affirming His divine approval and authority.<p><b>You handed Him over and rejected Him before Pilate</b><br>This phrase addresses the responsibility of the Jewish leaders and people in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. It reflects the historical events recorded in the Gospels, where Jesus is brought before Pilate (<a href="/matthew/27.htm">Matthew 27:1-2</a>, <a href="/mark/15.htm">Mark 15:1</a>, <a href="/luke/23.htm">Luke 23:1</a>, <a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>). The rejection of Jesus by His own people fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the servant is despised and rejected by men.<p><b>even though he had decided to release Him</b><br>This highlights Pilate's initial intention to release Jesus, as seen in <a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4, 14</a>-16, where Pilate finds no basis for a charge against Him. It underscores the injustice of Jesus' condemnation and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan despite human actions. This aspect of the narrative demonstrates the tension between divine providence and human responsibility, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, where Peter speaks of Jesus being handed over by God's set purpose and foreknowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting the faithfulness of God throughout generations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Referred to as God's servant, Jesus is the central figure who is glorified by God, fulfilling the messianic prophecies and serving as the Savior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor who presided over the trial of Jesus.

Human failure&#8212;even Pilate&#8217;s vacillation and the crowd&#8217;s rejection&#8212;stands exposed, yet it cannot thwart God&#8217;s saving purpose.

He speaks to the "men of Israel," and he connects the present miracle with all that God had (lone to their fathers in days gone by. He does not seem conscious of any break or transition, or of any change of posture or position. Only a new incident, long since promised by the prophets, has been added. "tie thrusts himself upon the fathers of old, lest he should appear to be introducing a new doctrine" (Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">God... hath glorified his Servant Jesus</span>. <span class="accented">Servant</span> is manifestly right (so St. Chrysostom).
