The "place of prayer" likely refers to a location outside the city gates by a river, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13</a>, where Jewish people and God-fearers gathered for worship and prayer. This setting highlights the importance of prayer in the early Christian community and their commitment to seeking God regularly. It also reflects the missionary strategy of Paul, who often began his ministry in a new city by connecting with the local Jewish community.<p><b>we were met by a slave girl with a spirit of divination</b><br>The encounter with the slave girl introduces a spiritual conflict. The "spirit of divination" is described in the original Greek as a "python spirit," associated with the oracle of Delphi and the god Apollo. This suggests a demonic influence, as the girl was possessed by a spirit that enabled her to predict the future. The presence of such a spirit indicates the spiritual darkness and opposition faced by the early church. The fact that she was a slave highlights her lack of freedom and the exploitation she suffered, both spiritually and economically.<p><b>who earned a large income for her masters by fortune-telling</b><br>This phrase underscores the economic exploitation of the girl by her owners, who profited from her spiritual bondage. The practice of fortune-telling was common in the Greco-Roman world, and people often sought guidance from oracles and seers. The large income suggests that her predictions were highly valued, reflecting the widespread belief in and reliance on such practices. This situation sets the stage for the conflict between the power of God and the forces of darkness, as well as the challenge to societal norms and economic interests that the gospel often brings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Key figures in the early Christian church, missionaries spreading the Gospel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/slave_girl.htm">Slave Girl</a></b><br>A young woman possessed by a spirit of divination, used by her masters for profit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_divination.htm">Spirit of Divination</a></b><br>The Greek term used here is (pneuma Pyth?na), referring to a spirit associated with the oracle of Delphi, indicating a demonic influence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/masters_of_the_slave_girl.htm">Masters of the Slave Girl</a></b><br>Individuals exploiting the girl's condition for financial gain.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/place_of_prayer.htm">Place of Prayer</a></b><br>A location where Paul and his companions regularly went to pray, likely a gathering place for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Discernment in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>Christians must be aware of spiritual influences and discern between what is of God and what is not.

It should be stated, however, that the Greek noun is used without the article, and that this is so far in favour of the Received rendering. On the other hand, we find the noun <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>or <span class= "ital">church, </span>used without the article in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-4.htm" title="He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.">1Corinthians 14:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-19.htm" title="Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.">1Corinthians 14:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-35.htm" title="And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.">1Corinthians 14:35</a>; <a href="/3_john/1-6.htm" title="Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:">3John 1:6</a>, and it is, therefore, probable that <span class= "ital">proseucha</span> might be used in the same way, just as we speak of "going to church, or to chapel," without the article. This was probably on the following Sabbath, or possibly after a longer interval, when the mission of the Apostles had become known, and had caused some excitement.<p><span class= "bld">A certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination.</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">a spirit of Python, </span>or, as some MSS. give it, <span class= "ital">a Python spirit. </span>The Python was the serpent worshipped at Delphi, as the symbol of wisdom, from whom the Pythian priestesses took their name, and from whom Apollo, as succeeding to the oracular power of the serpent, took the same adjective. The fact that St. Luke, who in his Gospel describes like phenomena as coming from <span class= "ital">daemonia, </span>"evil spirits," "unclean spirits," should here use this exceptional description, seems to imply either that this was the way in which the people of Philippi spoke of the maiden, or else that he recognised in her phenomena identical with those of the priestesses of Delphi, the wild distortions, the shrill cries, the madness of an evil inspiration. After the manner of sibyls, and sorceresses, and clairvoyants of other times, the girl, whom Augustine describes as <span class= "ital">faemina ventriloqua</span>--the phrase probably-expressing the peculiar tones characteristic of hysteria--was looked on as having power to divine and predict ("soothsaying," as distinct from "prophesying," exactly expresses the force of the Greek verb), and her wild cries were caught up and received as oracles. Plutarch (<span class= "ital">de Defect. Orac., </span>p. 737) speaks of the name Python as being applied commonly, in his time, to "ventriloquists" of this type. As she was a slave, her masters traded on her supposed inspiration, and made the girl, whom prayer and quiet might have restored to sanity, give answers to those who sought for oracular guidance in the perplexities of their lives. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Were going to the place of prayer</span> for <span class="accented">went to prayer</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">that a certain maid</span> for <span class="accented">a certain damsel</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">having</span> for <span class="accented">possessed with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The place of prayer</span>.

It was a name of Apollo in his character of a giver of oracles. Delphi itself, where his chief oracle was, was sometimes called <span class="accented">Pytho</span> (Schleusner, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>), and <span class="accented">Pythius</span> was a common epithet of Apollo. The name Python (Plut.,' De Defect. <span class="accented">Orac.</span>,' cap. 9) came thence to be applied to a ventriloquist (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>), or to the spirit that was conceived to dwell in ventriloquists and to speak by them, just as in Hebrew the ventriloquist was sometimes called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> if a woman), the owner of a spirit of divination, or simply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, a diviner (see <a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7</a> (twice) for the first use, and <a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-11.htm">Deuteronomy 18:11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>; for the second). In some passages, as 1 Kings 28:6 and <a href="/isaiah/29-4.htm">Isaiah 29:4</a>, it is doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> means the ventriloquist or the spirit. The feminine plural <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3, 9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>) seems always to denote the women, who, like the damsel in the text, practiced the art of ventriloquistic necromancy, whether really possessed by a spirit or feigning to be so. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is only found here in the New Testament. The LXX. usually render <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Gain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), literally, <span class="accented">work, craft</span>, or <span class="accented">trade</span>; then, by metonymy, <span class="accented">the gain</span> proceeding from such trade (<a href="/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By soothsaying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>).
