His boldness in the synagogue reflects the early Christian practice of engaging with Jewish communities in their places of worship. Synagogues were central to Jewish life, serving as places for teaching and community gatherings. Apollos's boldness is reminiscent of the apostles' courage in <a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>, where Peter and John spoke with confidence. This boldness is a hallmark of those filled with the Holy Spirit, as seen throughout Acts.<p><b>When Priscilla and Aquila heard him,</b><br>Priscilla and Aquila were a Jewish Christian couple who had previously worked with Paul in Corinth (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2-3</a>). Their presence in Ephesus, where this event takes place, highlights the mobility and interconnectedness of early Christian communities. Their ability to discern Apollos's teaching indicates their deep understanding of the faith. The mention of Priscilla before Aquila in some texts suggests her significant role in the early church, challenging cultural norms of the time.<p><b>they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of discipleship and mentorship in the early church. Apollos, though knowledgeable, needed further instruction, illustrating that learning is a continual process. The "way of God" refers to the teachings about Jesus Christ and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. This act of taking Apollos aside privately shows a respectful and effective method of correction, aligning with the principle of speaking the truth in love (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).

His boldness shows sincere conviction; like Peter and John earlier, he &#8220;could not stop speaking about what [he had] seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Bold proclamation is encouraged in Scripture (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>), yet boldness alone is not the final measure of truth. Apollos knew &#8220;only the baptism of John&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>), so his understanding of Christ&#8217;s finished work was partial.<p>&#8226; Application: zeal is valuable, but it must rest on complete gospel truth (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2-3</a>). God often pairs courage with ongoing learning to protect the church from error.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Priscilla and Aquila heard him, and took him aside</b><p>&#8226; This married ministry team had worked with Paul (<a href="/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2-3</a>) and hosted a house church (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). When they recognized gaps in Apollos&#8217;s message, they acted lovingly, not publicly shaming him.<p>&#8226; Their private approach models <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;restore him gently&#8221;&#8212;and <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24-25</a>&#8212;&#8220;the Lord&#8217;s servant must&#8230; be gentle, able to teach.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God often uses ordinary believers, not just apostles, to safeguard doctrine. Hospitality and quiet conversation can shape future leaders more effectively than public confrontation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They explained the way of God more accurately</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The way&#8221; refers to the full gospel: Christ&#8217;s death, resurrection, ascension, the coming of the Spirit, and believer&#8217;s baptism into Christ (<a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Apollos accepted correction, showing true humility (<a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>). His subsequent ministry in Achaia proved fruitful, &#8220;greatly helping those who had believed&#8221; (<a href="/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Accuracy matters. Paul later encountered disciples who, like Apollos, knew only John&#8217;s baptism; they received the Holy Spirit after hearing the complete message (<a href="/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1-6</a>). Right doctrine fuels right living and effective witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a> illustrates how God weaves together courage, humility, and community to advance the gospel. Apollos&#8217;s bold preaching needed fuller content; Priscilla and Aquila supplied it through gracious, private instruction. The passage teaches that fervor must be partnered with accuracy, correction should be delivered with gentleness, and every believer&#8212;man or woman, layperson or leader&#8212;has a role in safeguarding and spreading the truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard . . .</span>--Many of the best MSS. put Priscilla's name first, as in <a href="/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>. The fact mentioned is interesting as showing (1) that Aquila and his wife continued to attend the services of the synagogue, and (2) that Apollos appeared there, as St. Paul had done, in the character of a Rabbi who had a message to deliver, and was therefore allowed, or, it may be, requested (as in <a href="/acts/13-15.htm" title="And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, You men and brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.">Acts 13:15</a>), to address the people.<p><span class= "bld">And expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</span>--Better, as maintaining the right relation of the comparative to the positive adverb of the previous verse, <span class= "ital">more accurately.</span> The prominence given to Priscilla in this instruction implies that she was a woman of more than ordinary culture, a student of the older Scriptures, able, with a prophetic insight, to help even the disciple of Philo to understand them better than he had done before. It follows of necessity that "the way of God" which they "expounded" to him was the gospel as they had learnt it from St. Paul, perhaps as they had learnt it, at an earlier stage, from the lips of Stephen or his followers. (See Note on <a href="/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>.) It would include, to put the matter somewhat technically, the doctrines of salvation by grace, and justification by faith, and the gift of the Spirit, and union with Christ through baptism and the Supper of the Lord. It would seem to follow almost necessarily, as in the case of the twelve disciples in the next chapter (<a href="/context/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1-6</a>), that Apollos, who had before known only the baptism of John, was now baptised into "the name of the Lord Jesus."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/18-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5037.htm">Strong's 5037: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, both.
