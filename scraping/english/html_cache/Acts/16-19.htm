In the Roman world, slavery was a common practice, and individuals could own slaves who had special abilities, such as the spirit of divination possessed by this girl. The owners' primary concern was financial gain, reflecting a materialistic worldview that often clashed with the teachings of Christianity. The loss of income due to the exorcism performed by Paul underscores the tension between the early Christian mission and the economic interests of the time. This incident also illustrates the transformative power of the Gospel, which disrupts sinful practices and challenges societal norms.<p><b>they seized Paul and Silas</b><br>The act of seizing Paul and Silas demonstrates the hostility and opposition faced by early Christians. This physical apprehension is indicative of the broader persecution that the apostles and early believers often encountered. The Greek term used here implies a forceful and aggressive action, reflecting the anger and desperation of the girl's owners. This event is part of a pattern seen throughout Acts, where the proclamation of the Gospel leads to conflict and suffering for its messengers, echoing Jesus' own prediction that His followers would face persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>and dragged them before the authorities in the marketplace</b><br>The marketplace, or agora, was the center of public life in a Roman city, serving as a hub for commerce, social interaction, and legal proceedings. By bringing Paul and Silas to the authorities in this public setting, the accusers sought to leverage the legal system against them, possibly hoping to incite a public outcry. This tactic of using legal and civic structures to suppress the Christian message is seen elsewhere in Acts, such as in the trials of Peter and John (Acts 4) and later Paul himself (Acts 24-26). The involvement of the authorities highlights the intersection of religious and civic life in the Roman Empire and the challenges faced by the early church in navigating these dynamics.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_silas.htm">Paul and Silas</a></b><br>Early Christian missionaries and apostles who were spreading the Gospel in Philippi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/owners_of_the_slave_girl.htm">Owners of the Slave Girl</a></b><br>Individuals who profited from a slave girl&#8217;s ability to predict the future, which was attributed to a spirit of divination.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a></b><br>The public area in Philippi where legal matters and public discussions took place.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/authorities.htm">Authorities</a></b><br>The local magistrates or officials responsible for maintaining order and administering justice in the city.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philippi.htm">Philippi</a></b><br>A Roman colony in Macedonia, significant for being one of the first places in Europe where Paul established a Christian community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Christ may lead to opposition and persecution, as seen in the experience of Paul and Silas.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The casting out of the spirit highlights the reality of spiritual battles and the authority believers have in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_love_of_money.htm">The Love of Money</a></b><br>The owners' reaction underscores the dangers of prioritizing financial gain over righteousness and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/public_witness.htm">Public Witness</a></b><br>Paul and Silas's actions in the marketplace demonstrate the importance of maintaining a faithful witness in public spheres.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the immediate negative consequences, God used the situation to further His purposes, as seen later in the conversion of the Philippian jailer.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_16_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 16:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_16_19_Economic_impact_of_faith.htm">How does Acts 16:19 illustrate the consequences of disrupting economic interests for Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Acts_16_19_on_faith_trials.htm">What can we learn from Acts 16:19 about facing opposition for our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_16_19_Matt_5_10_link_in_persecution.htm">How does Acts 16:19 connect with Matthew 5:10 on persecution for righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_societal_conflict.htm">How should believers respond when societal norms conflict with God's mission, as in Acts 16:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_strong_in_faith_amid_opposition_3.htm">What practical steps can we take to stand firm in faith despite opposition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_owners_react_violently.htm">Why did the owners of the slave girl react violently in Acts 16:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Acts_16_19_Life_vs_Profit.htm">How does Acts 16:19 reflect on the value of human life versus profit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_16_19_Societal_norms_in_Philippi.htm">What does Acts 16:19 reveal about societal norms in ancient Philippi?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_were_paul_and_silas_jailed.htm">Why were Paul and Silas imprisoned in Philippi?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_trust_paul's_claim_on_macedonian_giving.htm">In 2 Corinthians 8:1&#8211;2, how can we trust Paul&#8217;s claim that the impoverished Macedonians gave beyond their means if there&#8217;s no external historical data corroborating their extreme poverty?

There is something like a prophetic significance in the use, at this stage, of the word which was the key to nearly all the persecutions to which the early believers were exposed. Men could tolerate varieties of worship or the speculations of philosophers: they were roused to madness by that which threatened their business. The use in the Greek of the same verb for "was gone," as had been used in the previous verse for "come out," gives an emphasis which the English does not reproduce.

So in <a href="/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, the litigants go to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, first, and he sends them on to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, or judge, who orders them for punishment. This seems a more probable explanation than that commonly adopted (Howson, Alford, Renan, Lewin, etc.), that the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> mean the same officers.

Nor is it likely that officers of such high rank as the duumviri, or proctors, as they had come to be called, should be always in the forum, to try every petty case (see articles "Colonia, Duumviri," and "Praetor," in 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities').

Philippi, being a colony, was governed by Roman magistrates called duumviri, corresponding to the two consuls at Rome. But we learn from Cicero that in his time the duuraviri in the colonies were beginning to be called praetors, a little previously used only at Rome ('De Leg. Agrar.,' 34), and to be preceded by lictors (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 35). Two inscriptions have been found in which the duumviri of Philippi are mentioned (Lewin, p. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/16-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the girl&#8217;s]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
