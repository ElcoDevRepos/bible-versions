The use of "we" suggests a firsthand account, emphasizing the historical reliability of the narrative. The decision to go ahead to the ship reflects the logistical planning involved in Paul's missionary journeys, highlighting the importance of teamwork and preparation in ministry.<p><b>and sailed to Assos</b><br>Assos was a city in the Roman province of Asia, located on the northwest coast of present-day Turkey. The journey from Troas to Assos by sea was approximately 30 miles, while the overland route was about 20 miles. The choice to sail to Assos demonstrates the strategic use of available transportation methods in spreading the Gospel. Assos was known for its philosophical schools, which may have provided Paul with opportunities for intellectual engagement and evangelism.<p><b>where we were to take Paul aboard</b><br>This indicates a prearranged plan for Paul to join the group at Assos. The coordination reflects Paul's leadership and the trust his companions placed in his decisions. It also suggests a level of flexibility and adaptability in their travel plans, which is often necessary in ministry work.<p><b>He had arranged this</b><br>Paul's arrangement to meet the group at Assos shows his intentionality and foresight. It may have allowed him time for personal reflection, prayer, or additional ministry work along the way. This decision underscores Paul's commitment to his mission and his ability to balance personal needs with the demands of his ministry.<p><b>because he was going there on foot</b><br>Paul's choice to travel on foot could have been motivated by several factors, including the opportunity for solitude, the chance to visit believers or preach along the way, or simply a preference for the overland route. Walking would have allowed Paul to engage more directly with the people and the land, reflecting Jesus' own itinerant ministry.
