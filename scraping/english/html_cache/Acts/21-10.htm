The "we" suggests the presence of the author, traditionally understood to be Luke, along with Paul and their companions. The setting is in Caesarea, a significant port city in ancient Judea, which served as a hub for early Christian activity. The mention of "several days" implies a time of fellowship and possibly ministry with the local believers, reflecting the communal nature of the early Church.<p><b>a prophet named Agabus</b><br>Agabus is identified as a prophet, a role that was vital in the early Church for guidance and revelation. He is previously mentioned in <a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>, where he predicted a severe famine. His presence underscores the continuity of prophetic ministry from the Old Testament into the New Testament era. Prophets in the early Church were seen as instruments of the Holy Spirit, providing insight and warnings to guide the believers.<p><b>came down from Judea</b><br>The phrase "came down" is geographically accurate, as Judea is situated at a higher elevation compared to Caesarea. Judea was the region surrounding Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and early Christian activity. Agabus's journey from Judea to Caesarea highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and the movement of leaders and prophets among them.

Paul is purposely delayed so that he will receive multiple confirmations&#8212;first from the disciples in Tyre (<a href="/acts/21-4.htm">Acts 21:4</a>), now from Agabus&#8212;regarding the hardships awaiting him in Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights strategic waiting before a significant move (e.g., <a href="/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4</a>; <a href="/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a>). Here the delay sets the stage for God to speak decisively through prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a prophet named Agabus</b><p>&#8226; Agabus is already known to the church. Years earlier he foretold a great famine, which &#8220;came to pass during the reign of Claudius&#8221; (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>). That fulfilled prediction establishes his credibility.<p>&#8226; His designation as &#8220;a prophet&#8221; aligns with <a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>, where prophets are listed as Christ-appointed gifts to the church.<p>&#8226; God still uses prophetic voices to confirm His will, though always subject to Scripture&#8217;s authority (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Agabus&#8217;s role here is to provide Paul with a vivid, inspired warning (spelled out in verses 11-12) so that the apostle&#8217;s coming suffering will not take him by surprise&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; own forewarnings to His disciples (<a href="/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came down from Judea</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Came down&#8221; reflects geography: Judea, with Jerusalem in the hill country, is higher in elevation than coastal Caesarea.

Agabus&#8217;s journey underscores that the Holy Spirit orchestrates encounters to guide His people at pivotal moments.<p>&#8226; Judea had recently seen hostility toward Paul (<a href="/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27&#8211;30</a>). The fact that a prophet comes from there rather than a persecutor illustrates God&#8217;s sovereign ability to bring encouragement even from regions of opposition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a> shows God orchestrating a timely prophetic encounter after a purposeful wait in Caesarea. Agabus, a proven prophet from Judea, arrives to deliver divine confirmation of the trials awaiting Paul in Jerusalem. The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to warn and prepare His servants, the legitimacy of prophetic ministry within the church, and the seamless connection between different regions and roles in God&#8217;s unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">As we tarried there many days . . .</span>--The adjective is in the comparative degree, and implies, accordingly, a longer time than had been intended. Probably the voyage had been quicker than the travellers had expected, and there was therefore time to remain at Caesarea, and yet to arrive at Jerusalem, as St. Paul purposed, in time for Pentecost (chap 20:16). There was, at any rate, time for the tidings of his arrival to reach Jerusalem, and for Agabus (see Note on <a href="/acts/11-28.htm" title="And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.">Acts 11:28</a>) to come down in consequence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>).
