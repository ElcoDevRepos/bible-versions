In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, Paul is addressing the crew and passengers aboard a ship caught in a violent storm. The exhortation to "take courage" is a common biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God commands Joshua to be strong and courageous. This reflects a consistent biblical principle that faith in God provides strength and courage in the face of adversity. Historically, the Mediterranean Sea was known for its treacherous storms, making this encouragement particularly poignant.<p><b>for I believe God</b><br>Paul's declaration of faith is central to his message. His belief is not in the ship's ability to withstand the storm or in human efforts, but in God's promise. This reflects the broader biblical theme of faith in God's word, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Paul's faith is reminiscent of Abraham's faith in God's promises (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>), serving as a model for believers to trust in God's word despite circumstances.<p><b>that it will happen</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty of God's promises. Paul's confidence that "it will happen" is rooted in the reliability of God's word. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God declares that His word will not return void but will accomplish what He desires. The assurance of God's promises is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, providing believers with hope and certainty in God's faithfulness.<p><b>just as He told me</b><br>Paul refers to a specific revelation from God, which he received through an angel (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>). This divine communication assures Paul of the safety of all aboard the ship. The phrase highlights the importance of divine revelation and prophecy in the biblical narrative. It also points to the broader theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to communicate His will to His servants. This assurance is similar to the prophetic messages given to Old Testament prophets, affirming that God's plans will be fulfilled exactly as He declares.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is on his way to Rome as a prisoner.

Panic was spreading, supplies were running low, and every earthly hope seemed gone. Into that chaos Paul says, &#8220;So take courage, men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Courage is not self-generated bravado; it comes from a word from God. Joshua heard the same call while facing Canaanite giants&#8212;&#8220;Be strong and courageous, for the LORD your God is with you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Encouragement is contagious. When one believer stands on God&#8217;s promise, others find fresh strength, much like Jonathan&#8217;s faith stirred the trembling Israelites (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord delights to give courage precisely when circumstances scream otherwise: &#8220;In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I believe God</b><p>Paul anchors his exhortation in a settled conviction: &#8220;I believe God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Faith rests on God&#8217;s character. &#8220;The word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>). If the Almighty cannot lie (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), His promise is as solid as His throne.<p>&#8226; Faith is personal. Paul does not merely believe in God; he believes God&#8212;taking Him at His word just as Abraham &#8220;was fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith is practical. In the pitch-black Mediterranean night, belief translates into action&#8212;cutting away lifeboats (<a href="/acts/27-30.htm">Acts 27:30-32</a>) and eating a meal in expectation of rescue (<a href="/acts/27-33.htm">Acts 27:33-36</a>). &#8220;We walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That it will happen just as He told me</b><p>An angel had already assured Paul, &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230; God has granted you all those who sail with you&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>). Paul treats that revelation as settled fact.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s specific promises lead to specific expectations. Jesus said, &#8220;Let us go over to the other side of the lake&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>), and not even a sudden squall could nullify His word.<p>&#8226; Obedience flows from certainty. Because Paul trusts the promise, he can direct the crew without hesitation: stay with the ship, run aground where God appoints, and everyone will survive (<a href="/acts/27-31.htm">Acts 27:31-32, 44</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment glorifies God alone. When all 276 souls stand safely on Malta&#8217;s shore (<a href="/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>), it is evident that &#8220;not one word has failed of all His good promise&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/8-56.htm">1 Kings 8:56</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/27-25.htm">Acts 27:25</a> is a clarion call to courageous faith. In the darkest storm Paul looks beyond circumstances to the unbreakable word of God, rallies others to do the same, and watches the promise unfold exactly as spoken. When He says it, it will happen. Our task is simple: believe God, take courage, and act accordingly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Even so</span> for <span class="accented">even</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">hath been spoken unto me</span> for <span class="accented">was told</span> me, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be of good cheer</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> ver. 22; elsewhere only <a href="/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, but we have <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ver. 36 and <a href="/acts/24-10.htm">Acts 24:10</a>; common in classical Greek and in medical language (see ver. 22, note).
