In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, Paul is on a journey to Rome as a prisoner. Despite the perilous storm, Paul reassures them of their safety, demonstrating his leadership and faith. This moment highlights Paul's role as a spiritual leader, even in dire circumstances, and reflects his unwavering trust in God's promises.<p><b>Paul took bread</b><br>Bread in biblical times was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and life. Paul's action of taking bread is reminiscent of Jesus' actions during the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>). This act can be seen as a type of Christ, where Paul, like Jesus, provides physical and spiritual nourishment. It also signifies a moment of calm and provision amidst chaos, reflecting God's provision in times of need.<p><b>and gave thanks to God</b><br>Giving thanks before a meal was a common Jewish practice, acknowledging God's provision. Paul's public thanksgiving serves as a testimony of faith to those around him, many of whom were likely pagans. This act of gratitude in the face of adversity exemplifies a deep trust in God's sovereignty and serves as a witness to the power of faith.<p><b>in front of them all</b><br>Paul's public act of giving thanks is significant. It demonstrates his boldness in faith and his desire to witness to others. In a time of fear and uncertainty, Paul's visible faith provides comfort and encouragement to those present. This public declaration of faith can be seen as an evangelistic moment, where Paul's actions speak louder than words.<p><b>Then he broke it</b><br>Breaking bread is a significant act, symbolizing sharing and community. This action is reminiscent of Jesus breaking bread with His disciples, as seen in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>). It signifies fellowship and unity, even among a diverse group of people on the ship. This act of breaking bread can also be seen as a type of Christ, pointing to Jesus' sacrifice and the breaking of His body for humanity.<p><b>and began to eat</b><br>Paul's act of eating after giving thanks and breaking the bread is practical and symbolic. It demonstrates trust in God's promise of safety and provision. By eating, Paul sets an example for others to follow, encouraging them to take heart and have faith. This act of eating can also be seen as a precursor to the Eucharist, where believers partake in the body of Christ, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and central figure in this passage, who demonstrates faith and leadership during a perilous sea voyage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ship.htm">The Ship</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Paul and others are caught in a storm while traveling to Rome.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crew_and_passengers.htm">The Crew and Passengers</a></b><br>A diverse group of individuals, including sailors, soldiers, and prisoners, witnessing Paul's actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_storm.htm">The Storm</a></b><br>A significant event that tests the faith and resolve of everyone on board, leading to Paul's act of thanksgiving.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of Paul's gratitude, highlighting the divine presence and providence in the midst of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_in_crisis.htm">Gratitude in Crisis</a></b><br>Paul's act of giving thanks amidst a storm teaches us to maintain a heart of gratitude, trusting in God's sovereignty even in dire situations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_by_example.htm">Leadership by Example</a></b><br>Paul leads by example, showing that faith and calmness can influence and encourage others during challenging times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Paul's breaking of bread and giving thanks is a practical demonstration of faith, reminding us to act on our beliefs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_witness.htm">Community Witness</a></b><br>Paul's public thanksgiving serves as a testimony to those around him, illustrating the impact of visible faith on a community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>The act of breaking bread symbolizes reliance on God's provision, encouraging believers to trust in His care and sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Acts_27_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Acts 27:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Acts_27_35_Why_give_thanks_before_meals.htm">How does Acts 27:35 demonstrate the importance of giving thanks before meals?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Paul_s_faith_in_Acts_27_35.htm">What can we learn from Paul's example of faith in Acts 27:35?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Acts_27_35_Matt_15_36_Thanksgiving_link.htm">How does Acts 27:35 connect with Jesus giving thanks in Matthew 15:36?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Implement_daily_gratitude_like_Paul.htm">How can we implement gratitude in our daily routines like Paul in Acts?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_public_prayer_witness_in_Acts_27_35.htm">What role does public prayer play in witnessing to others, as seen in Acts 27:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Acts_27_35_Faith_in_God_s_provision.htm">How does Acts 27:35 demonstrate faith in God's provision during adversity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_giving_thanks_important_in_Acts_27_35.htm">What significance does giving thanks have in Acts 27:35?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Acts_27_35_Early_Christian_gratitude.htm">How does Acts 27:35 reflect early Christian practices of gratitude?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_acts_27.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Acts 27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/can_women_teach_in_church.htm">Can women teach in church?

(See Note on <a href="/matthew/14-9.htm" title="And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.">Matthew 14:9</a>.) To the heathen soldiers and sailors it was probably altogether new, and at such a moment must have been singularly impressive. The act of "breaking bread," though in itself not more than the natural incident of such a meal, must at least have reminded the few Christians who were his companions of the more solemn "breaking of bread" with which they were familiar. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>.) For them the meal, if not strictly eucharistic, in the liturgical sense of that term, would be at least as an <span class= "ital">Agape, </span>or feast of charity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="accented">- Said this</span> for <span class="accented">thus spoken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and had taken</span> for <span class="accented">he took</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he gave</span> for <span class="accented">and gave</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the presence of all</span> for <span class="accented">presence of them all</span>, A.V.; be <span class="accented">brake</span> for <span class="accented">when he had broken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and began</span> for <span class="accented">he began</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Had taken bread</span>, etc. The concurrence of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which all occur in the institution of the Holy Eucharist (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>), is certainly, as Bishop Wordsworth says, remarkable. But there is the same similarity of phrase (except that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is used for <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> in the first passage) in <a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a> and Matthew 15:36, and therefore the conclusion to be drawn is that St. Paul's action and words were the same as those of our Lord, as far as the breaking bread and giving thanks and eating, went, which were common to both occasions; but in the institution of the sacrament the words "This is my body" were additional, and represented an additional and sacramental truth.
