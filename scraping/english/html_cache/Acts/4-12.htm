In the context of <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4</a>, Peter and John are addressing the Sanhedrin, affirming that Jesus is the cornerstone rejected by the builders (<a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>). This exclusivity is consistent with Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where He declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life. The early church faced significant opposition for this claim, as it contradicted the pluralistic religious environment of the Roman Empire, which was characterized by a pantheon of gods and religious tolerance.<p><b>for there is no other name under heaven</b><br>The phrase "no other name under heaven" underscores the universal scope of Christ's authority and the divine mandate of His name. In Jewish culture, a name was not merely an identifier but represented the essence and authority of a person. The name of Jesus, meaning "Yahweh is salvation," signifies His divine mission. This assertion challenges the prevailing religious systems of the time, including the Jewish leaders' reliance on the Law and the Roman practice of emperor worship.<p><b>given to men</b><br>The phrase "given to men" highlights the grace and initiative of God in providing salvation. It reflects the biblical theme of God's redemptive plan for humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God gives His only Son for the salvation of the world. This gift is not earned by human effort but is a divine provision, aligning with the doctrine of grace found throughout the New Testament.<p><b>by which we must be saved.</b><br>The necessity of salvation "by which we must be saved" points to the urgency and essential nature of accepting Christ. The use of "must" indicates an imperative, leaving no alternative for salvation. This aligns with the apostolic preaching in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, where Peter calls for repentance and baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins. The phrase also connects to the prophetic fulfillment of the Old Testament, where the Messiah is depicted as the sole source of deliverance for God's people (Isaiah 53).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were speaking to the Sanhedrin, boldly proclaiming the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, consisting of religious leaders who were questioning Peter and John about their teachings and the healing of a lame man.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose name is declared as the only means of salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant as the center of Jewish religious life and the early Christian church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_of_the_lame_man.htm">The Healing of the Lame Man</a></b><br>A miraculous event that led to Peter and John being questioned by the Sanhedrin, providing the context for their bold proclamation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusivity_of_salvation.htm">Exclusivity of Salvation</a></b><br><a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a> clearly states that salvation is found in no one else but Jesus Christ.

The Greek has the article before "salvation." That of which Peter spoke was <span class= "ital">the</span> salvation which the rulers professed to be looking for.<p><span class= "bld">Given among men.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">that has been given.</span> The words must be taken in the sense which Peter had learnt to attach to the thought of the Name as the symbol of personality and power. To those to whom it had been made known, and who had taken in all that it embodied, the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth was the one true source of deliverance and salvation. Speaking for himself and the rulers, Peter rightly says that it is the Name "whereby <span class= "ital">we</span> must be saved." Where it is not so known, it rises to its higher significance as the symbol of a divine energy; and so we may rightly say that the heathen who obtain salvation are saved by the Name of the Lord of whom they have never heard.
