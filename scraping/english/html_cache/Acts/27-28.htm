Sailors used a lead line, a rope with a lead weight, to determine how deep the water was. This practice was crucial for avoiding underwater hazards and ensuring safe passage, especially in unfamiliar or treacherous waters. The act of taking soundings reflects the sailors' caution and experience, highlighting the perilous nature of their journey.<p><b>and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep.</b><br>A fathom is approximately six feet, so twenty fathoms would be about 120 feet deep. This depth indicates that the ship was approaching land, as shallower waters typically suggest proximity to the shore. The context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a> describes Paul's journey to Rome, where he faced a storm at sea. The decreasing depth would have been a sign of nearing land, which was both hopeful and dangerous, as it could mean potential shipwreck if not navigated carefully.<p><b>Going a little farther,</b><br>This phrase suggests the ship continued its course, albeit cautiously. The decision to proceed indicates the crew's desire to find a safe harbor or anchorage. In the broader narrative of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, this moment is part of the intense struggle against the storm, where every decision could mean life or death for those aboard.<p><b>they took another set of soundings</b><br>The repetition of taking soundings shows the sailors' diligence and the increasing urgency of their situation. It underscores the importance of constant vigilance in navigating the stormy seas. This careful monitoring reflects the broader biblical theme of watchfulness and preparedness, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>, where believers are urged to stay alert.<p><b>that read fifteen fathoms.</b><br>The reduction in depth to fifteen fathoms, or about 90 feet, indicates that the ship was getting closer to land. This change would have heightened the tension among the crew and passengers, as the risk of running aground increased. In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, this moment foreshadows the impending shipwreck on the island of Malta, where God's providence and protection over Paul and his companions are ultimately revealed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The Apostle Paul is on a journey to Rome as a prisoner.
