Caesarea was the administrative center of the Roman province of Judea. The Jewish leaders were seeking to accuse Paul, who had been held in custody. This reflects the ongoing tension between the early Christian movement and Jewish authorities, as well as the political dynamics of Roman governance.<p><b>I did not delay</b><br>Festus's prompt action indicates his desire to handle the matter efficiently, reflecting Roman legal practices that valued swift justice. This also highlights the urgency with which the Jewish leaders wanted to deal with Paul, whom they saw as a significant threat to their religious authority.<p><b>The next day I sat on the judgment seat</b><br>The judgment seat, or "bema," was a raised platform where Roman officials would hear legal cases. This setting underscores the formal and serious nature of the proceedings. The bema is also mentioned in other New Testament contexts, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>, where it symbolizes the judgment seat of Christ, drawing a parallel between earthly and divine judgment.<p><b>and ordered that the man be brought in</b><br>This refers to Paul being brought before Festus for trial. Paul's trials before Roman authorities are a recurring theme in Acts, illustrating the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would stand before governors and kings (<a href="/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>). Paul's defense of his faith in these trials serves as a testimony to the spread of the Gospel and the sovereignty of God in using legal systems to further His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/festus.htm">Festus</a></b><br>The Roman governor who succeeded Felix.
