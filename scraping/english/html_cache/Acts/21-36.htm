This scene takes place during Paul's visit to Jerusalem, where he was falsely accused of bringing Gentiles into the temple, a serious offense in Jewish law. The crowd's reaction is reminiscent of the mob mentality seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the crowd that demanded Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-22.htm">Matthew 27:22-23</a>). The crowd's behavior reflects the tension between Jewish traditions and the emerging Christian faith, highlighting the challenges faced by early Christians in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>kept shouting</b><br>The continuous shouting indicates the intensity and urgency of the crowd's demand. This reflects the deep-seated animosity and misunderstanding between the Jewish leaders and Paul, who was seen as a threat to their religious authority. The repetitive nature of their shouting can be compared to the persistent cries of the crowd during Jesus' trial, emphasizing the theme of persecution faced by those who follow Christ. This also illustrates the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy that His followers would face opposition (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Away with him!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase echoes the cries of the crowd during Jesus' trial before Pilate, where they shouted, "Crucify him!" (<a href="/luke/23-21.htm">Luke 23:21</a>). The demand to remove Paul from their presence signifies a rejection not only of him but of the message he carried. In a broader theological context, this reflects the rejection of the Gospel by those who are hardened in their hearts. The phrase "Away with him" can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Paul, like Jesus, is rejected and persecuted for the sake of the Gospel. This rejection is a recurring theme in the New Testament, illustrating the cost of discipleship and the reality of spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is the central figure in this passage.

Scripture consistently warns about the moral danger of mass passion (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-15</a>).<p>- Like the crowds that demanded Barabbas and rejected Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a>), this assembly in Jerusalem shows how collective emotion can drown out truth.<p>- Acts repeatedly notes &#8220;the crowds&#8221; as a decisive force against the gospel (<a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>; 14:19; 17:5). Their presence fulfills Jesus&#8217; forecast that His followers would face the same hostility He endured (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that followed him</b><p>- &#8220;Him&#8221; is Paul, just rescued by Roman soldiers (<a href="/acts/21-32.htm">Acts 21:32-35</a>). The crowd refuses to disperse; they trail after the cohort, determined to see Paul punished.<p>- This pursuit echoes earlier scenes where mobs shadowed Jesus (<a href="/john/6-24.htm">John 6:24</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/acts/5-26.htm">Acts 5:26</a>). Opposition often stays close on the heels of gospel messengers (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>- The scene underscores Paul&#8217;s steadfastness: even when stalked by rage, he continues toward God-ordained appointments (<a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>kept shouting</b><p>- The verb stresses ongoing, loud, unified cries&#8212;an unrelenting barrage. Similar relentless shouts pushed Pilate to crucify Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-23.htm">Luke 23:23</a>) and later silenced Paul&#8217;s defense (<a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>).<p>- Persistent noise can masquerade as moral certainty, but Scripture distinguishes volume from righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>; <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>).<p>- The repetition shows how unchecked anger escalates, fulfilling <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>&#8217;s pattern: desire&#8212;sin&#8212;death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Away with him!&#8221;</b><p>- Identical words resounded in the judgment hall of Jesus: &#8220;Away with Him, crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>). The parallel is deliberate; Paul now shares in &#8220;the fellowship of His sufferings&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).<p>- In their minds, &#8220;Away&#8221; means removal unto death (<a href="/acts/22-22.htm">Acts 22:22</a>). The gospel provokes either repentance or rejection; here the latter erupts.<p>- Yet God turns their rage into a stage for Paul to testify in chains (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). Human wrath cannot thwart divine purpose (<a href="/psalms/76-10.htm">Psalm 76:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/21-36.htm">Acts 21:36</a> shows a real, hostile multitude relentlessly tailing Paul, loudly demanding his elimination&#8212;mirroring the treatment of Christ.
