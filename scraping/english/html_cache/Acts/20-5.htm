In the context of <a href="/acts/20.htm">Acts 20</a>, these men were likely sent ahead to prepare for Paul's arrival, ensuring that logistical arrangements were in place. This practice of sending people ahead was common in ancient travel, especially for someone like Paul who was leading a missionary journey. It reflects the organized nature of Paul's ministry and the importance of teamwork in the early church. The men mentioned earlier in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> include Sopater, Aristarchus, Secundus, Gaius, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, representing various regions, which underscores the diverse and inclusive nature of the early Christian mission.<p><b>and waited for us</b><br>The use of "us" indicates that the author of Acts, traditionally believed to be Luke, was present with Paul during this part of the journey. This is part of the "we" passages in Acts, which suggest that Luke was an eyewitness to these events. The waiting implies a coordinated effort and a sense of unity among Paul's companions. It also highlights the importance of fellowship and mutual support in the early church, as they were traveling through regions that could be hostile to their message.<p><b>in Troas.</b><br>Troas was a significant city in the Roman province of Asia, located near the ancient site of Troy. It served as a major port and a crossroads for travelers between Asia and Europe. The city was an important location for Paul's missionary activities. In <a href="/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8-10</a>, Paul received a vision in Troas calling him to Macedonia, marking the beginning of the spread of the Gospel into Europe. Troas is also mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12-13</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a>, indicating its continued importance in Paul's ministry. The archaeological remains of Troas, including its harbor and roads, provide insight into the strategic significance of the city in facilitating travel and communication in the ancient world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/these_men.htm">These Men</a></b><br>Refers to the group of companions traveling with Paul.

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1Corinthians 5:7-8</a>); (2) The disciples who went on in advance would announce St. Paul's coming to the church of Troas, and so there would be a full gathering to receive him and listen to him on his arrival.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- But these had gone</span> for <span class="accented">these going</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and were waiting</span> for <span class="accented">tarried</span>, A.V. The narrative is so concise that the exact details are matters of conjecture. There is consequently much difference of opinion about them. Howson, with whom Farrar (vol. 2:274) apparently agrees, thinks that the whole party traveled together by land through Bercea and Thessalonica, to Philippi; that the party consisting of Sopater, Aristarchus and Secundus, Gains, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, went on at once from Philippi <span class="accented">via</span> Neapolis, to Troas, leaving St. Paul, who was now joined by St. Luke, at Philippi, to pass eight or nine days there during the Feast of the Passover. And this seems quite consistent with St. Luke's narrative. But Lewin (vol. it. p. 74) thinks that only St. Paul (accompanied, as he supposes, by Luke, Titus, and Jason) went to Macedonia, and that the others sailed direct from Cenchreae to Troas. Renan, on the other hand, thinks they all sailed together from Cenchreae to Neapolis, whence Paul's party went to Philippi, and the others to Troas. There is no clue to the reason why the party thus separated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These [men]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">went on ahead</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proelthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4281.htm">Strong's 4281: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go forward, go on, advance; I go before, precede.
