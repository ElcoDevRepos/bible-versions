Roman commanders were often stationed in the Antonia Fortress, which overlooked the Temple Mount, allowing them to quickly respond to disturbances. Paul's arrest was a fulfillment of the prophecy given by Agabus in <a href="/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10-11</a>, where he predicted that Paul would be bound by the Jews and handed over to the Gentiles. This event marks a significant turning point in Paul's ministry, as it leads to his eventual journey to Rome.<p><b>ordering that he be bound with two chains</b><br>The use of two chains indicates that Paul was considered a significant threat or criminal, as this was a method used to secure dangerous prisoners. This act of binding fulfills the prophecy of Agabus, symbolizing Paul's impending trials and sufferings. The imagery of being bound also parallels Jesus Christ's own arrest and binding before His crucifixion, highlighting Paul's role as a type of Christ in his willingness to suffer for the sake of the Gospel.<p><b>Then he asked who he was and what he had done</b><br>The commander's inquiry reflects the confusion and chaos surrounding the situation. The Roman authorities were often unfamiliar with the intricacies of Jewish religious disputes, which is evident in the commander's need to ascertain Paul's identity and the nature of his alleged crime. This moment underscores the tension between the early Christian movement and the Jewish authorities, as well as the Roman Empire's role as an unwitting participant in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. The question of Paul's identity also echoes the broader theme of identity in Christ, as Paul himself frequently emphasizes his identity as a servant of Christ in his epistles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commander.htm">The Commander (Chiliarchos)</a></b><br>A Roman military officer in charge of a cohort, typically consisting of about 1,000 soldiers.
