The use of "therefore" indicates that what follows is a logical outcome of the preceding discussion. Paul has been addressing the Jewish leaders in Rome, explaining the fulfillment of the prophecies concerning the Messiah and the rejection of this message by many of the Jewish people. The phrase "be advised" is a call to attention, urging the listeners to understand the significance of what is about to be declared.<p><b>that God&#8217;s salvation</b><br>The term "God's salvation" refers to the deliverance and redemption offered through Jesus Christ. This salvation is a central theme throughout the New Testament, emphasizing that it is initiated and accomplished by God. In the context of Acts, salvation is not limited to a particular ethnic group but is available to all who believe. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<p><b>has been sent to the Gentiles,</b><br>This statement marks a pivotal moment in the early Christian movement, highlighting the shift from a predominantly Jewish audience to a broader Gentile mission. The inclusion of the Gentiles was always part of God's redemptive plan, as seen in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>) and the prophetic writings (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). Paul's ministry, as described in Acts, consistently demonstrates this outreach to the Gentiles, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>and they will listen!&#8221;</b><br>The assurance that the Gentiles "will listen" contrasts with the rejection by many of the Jewish people. This reflects the openness and receptivity of the Gentile audience to the gospel message, as seen in various accounts throughout Acts (e.g., <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius, <a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48</a>). The statement underscores the sovereignty of God in the spread of the gospel and the fulfillment of His purposes, as well as the responsiveness of those who are called to faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, Paul is the speaker in this verse.

The verse affirms divine initiative, human responsibility, and the unstoppable spread of the gospel to all peoples, while still leaving the door open for anyone who will heed the message.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God . . .</span>--The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">"this</span> salvation," the demonstrative adjective having the same force as in "the words of <span class= "ital">this</span> life," in <a href="/acts/5-20.htm" title="Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.">Acts 5:20</a>.

We can, in some measure, enter into the feelings which filled the Apostle's mind, through what we read in Romans 9-11,--the bitter pain at the rejection of Israel, relieved by a far-off hope of their restoration, the acceptance of God's ways as unsearchable and past finding out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> <span class="accented">- This salvation</span> for <span class="accented">the salvation</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they will also hear</span> for <span class="accented">and that they will hear it</span>, A.V.
