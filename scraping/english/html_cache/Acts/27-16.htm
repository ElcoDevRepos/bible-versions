This was a common navigational practice in ancient maritime travel to avoid the full force of the wind and waves. Cauda, also known as Clauda, is a small island located south of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. This geographical detail highlights the accuracy of Luke's account, as the island is a real location that aligns with the described route. The mention of Cauda provides a specific point in the journey, emphasizing the perilous conditions faced by Paul and his companions. This part of the journey reflects the challenges and dangers of sea travel in the ancient world, which often required skillful navigation and reliance on natural landmarks.<p><b>we barely managed to secure the lifeboat</b><br>The lifeboat, or skiff, was a smaller vessel towed behind the main ship, used for various purposes such as reaching shore or transferring goods and people. The phrase "barely managed" indicates the severity of the storm and the crew's struggle to maintain control. Securing the lifeboat was crucial to prevent it from being lost or damaged, which would have been disastrous in an emergency. This action demonstrates the crew's desperation and the dire circumstances they faced. The effort to secure the lifeboat can be seen as a metaphor for human attempts to preserve life amidst chaos, echoing themes of divine providence and human responsibility found throughout Scripture. The struggle to secure the lifeboat also foreshadows the subsequent events of the shipwreck, highlighting the tension between human effort and reliance on God's protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

God often provides pockets of mercy in rough seasons: Elijah found a broom tree for shade (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4&#8211;6</a>); the Israelites found an oasis at Elim (<a href="/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>).

The first step was to get the boat, which hitherto apparently had been towed through the waves, on board the ship. This, as St. Luke says, was a matter of much work (literally, <span class= "ital">we were with difficulty able to get hold of the boat</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>partly, we may believe, because it was not easy to keep the vessel with her head to the wind, and so avoid the motion which would have impeded the operation, partly, because the boat was probably full of water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Under the lee of</span> for <span class="accented">under</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">small</span> for <span class="accented">certain</span>, A.V.

The boat was doubtless being towed astern.

Under the lee of the little island, however, the sea was somewhat quieter; and so after greater efforts they secured the boat, and, as it is said in the next verse, "hoisted it up" on to the deck. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Passing to the lee</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hypodramontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5295.htm">Strong's 5295: </a> </span><span class="str2">To run under shelter of.
