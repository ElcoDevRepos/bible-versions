Peter, a leading apostle, is addressing a group of Gentiles in the house of Cornelius, a Roman centurion. This setting is crucial as it represents the breaking of traditional Jewish boundaries, where Jews typically did not associate with Gentiles. Peter's willingness to speak to them indicates a shift in understanding and acceptance of God's broader plan for salvation.<p><b>I now truly understand:</b><br>Peter's statement reflects a revelation and a deepened comprehension of God's will. This understanding comes after a vision he received in Joppa, where God showed him a sheet with unclean animals, instructing him to eat. This vision symbolized the removal of the Jewish dietary laws as a barrier to fellowship with Gentiles. It signifies Peter's personal growth and the unfolding of God's inclusive plan.<p><b>that God does not show favoritism:</b><br>This phrase underscores a foundational truth about God's character. In the Jewish context, there was a belief in their unique status as God's chosen people. However, Peter's declaration aligns with the broader biblical narrative that God's love and salvation are available to all humanity. This echoes Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of being a light to the Gentiles. It also connects with New Testament teachings, like <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>, where Paul states that God shows no partiality. This understanding is pivotal for the early church's mission to spread the Gospel beyond Jewish communities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, a key leader in the early Christian church.

Three rooftop visions (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>) finally click; the sheet of &#8220;unclean&#8221; animals has pointed to people, not food.<p>&#8226; Spiritual insight often arrives through obedient steps: only after Peter travels to Caesarea does he grasp the fuller meaning (<a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This dawning awareness parallels Paul&#8217;s prayer that believers may &#8220;receive the spirit of wisdom and revelation&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>) and the promise that the Spirit &#8220;searches all things&#8221; and reveals them to us (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that God does not show favoritism</b><p>&#8226; The declaration upends centuries of cultural and religious boundary lines. God&#8217;s covenant had always planned blessing for &#8220;all families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), yet many in Israel missed that global horizon.<p>&#8226; Peter affirms what Moses taught: &#8220;The LORD your God &#8230; shows no partiality&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>). Paul later echoes the same truth: &#8220;For there is no favoritism with God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine impartiality does not erase distinctions of ethnicity or history, but it does level the ground at the cross: &#8220;There is neither Jew nor Greek &#8230; for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the verse calls believers to mirror God&#8217;s heart&#8212;welcoming all who fear Him and practice righteousness (<a href="/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a>), refusing prejudices that contradict the gospel (<a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a> records the instant Peter recognizes God&#8217;s impartial love. Set in a Gentile home, the verse announces that the Good News is for every nation, breaking barriers Israel&#8212;and sometimes the church&#8212;has erected. God&#8217;s redemptive plan has always been global; Peter&#8217;s confession simply catches up with that reality. The passage invites us to celebrate and live out the same impartial grace, extending Christ&#8217;s welcome to everyone He brings across our path.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons.</span>--In regard to all distinctions of social rank, or wealth, or knowledge, Peter had seen in his Master that absence of "respect of persons" which even His enemies acknowledged (<a href="/matthew/22-16.htm" title="And they sent out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, neither care you for any man: for you regard not the person of men.">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>). St. James lays stress on that element of character, within the same limits, as essential to all who seek to be true disciples of the Christ (<a href="/context/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1-7</a>). Both, however, needed to be taught that the same law of an impartial equity had a yet wider application, that the privileges and prerogatives of Israel, whatever blessings they might confer, were not to be set up as a barrier against the admission of other races to an equal fellowship in Christ. God had accepted the centurion. It remained for His servants to accept him also. It is instructive to note that St. Paul reproduces the same thought in nearly the same phrase (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/10-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
