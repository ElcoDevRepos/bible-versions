It was a significant center for trade and travel. Sharon refers to the fertile plain stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the hill country of Judea. This area was known for its beauty and agricultural productivity. The mention of both Lydda and Sharon indicates a widespread impact of the miracle performed by Peter, as these regions were populous and influential. The phrase suggests that the news of the miracle reached a broad audience, emphasizing the far-reaching effects of the apostles' ministry.<p><b>saw him</b><br>The "him" refers to Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years due to paralysis and was miraculously healed by Peter in the name of Jesus Christ. The physical evidence of Aeneas's healing was undeniable and served as a powerful testimony to the people. In biblical times, witnessing a miracle was a compelling reason for belief, as it demonstrated the power and authority of God working through His apostles. The act of seeing here is not just physical but also spiritual, as it opened the eyes of the people to the reality of God's power.<p><b>and turned to the Lord</b><br>The phrase indicates a conversion experience, where individuals not only acknowledged the miracle but also committed themselves to follow Jesus Christ. This turning to the Lord signifies repentance and faith, key components of Christian conversion. The transformation of lives in response to witnessing God's power is a recurring theme in the New Testament. This event echoes the broader mission of the early church to spread the gospel and make disciples of all nations, as commanded by Jesus in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The turning to the Lord also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the nations coming to know God, such as in <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>, where God calls all the ends of the earth to turn to Him and be saved.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lydda.htm">Lydda</a></b><br>A town in the coastal plain of Israel, known today as Lod.
