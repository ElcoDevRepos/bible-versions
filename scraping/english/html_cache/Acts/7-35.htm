This rejection is significant as it highlights the recurring theme of God's chosen leaders being initially dismissed by their own people. This pattern is seen throughout the Bible, including the rejection of prophets and ultimately Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Who made you ruler and judge?&#8217;</b><br>This question reflects the skepticism and resistance Moses faced from his own people. It underscores the human tendency to question authority and divine appointment. The phrase echoes the Israelites' lack of faith and trust in God's plan, a theme that recurs throughout their wilderness journey. It also foreshadows the rejection of Jesus, who was questioned and doubted by the religious leaders of His time (<a href="/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23</a>).<p><b>is the one whom God sent to be their ruler and redeemer</b><br>Despite the initial rejection, God chose Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. This demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to use unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes. Moses as a redeemer is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Redeemer of humanity. Just as Moses delivered Israel from physical bondage, Jesus delivers from spiritual bondage (<a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3-6</a>).<p><b>through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</b><br>The angel in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) signifies God's presence and His call to Moses. This theophany is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the beginning of Moses' mission to liberate the Israelites. The burning bush is often seen as a symbol of God's holiness and His ability to sustain and empower His chosen servants. The angel's presence also points to the divine nature of Moses' mission, paralleling the divine mission of Christ, who was sent by God to redeem the world (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

That Angel speaks as God Himself (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The holy ground moment validated Moses&#8217; mission (<a href="/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine revelation equips human messengers (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-14</a>).<p>Stephen reminds the council that rejecting Moses&#8212;and by extension Jesus&#8212;means resisting the God who spoke from the fire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/7-35.htm">Acts 7:35</a> shows God overturning human rejection to install His chosen deliverer. The Israelites scoffed, &#8220;Who made you ruler and judge?&#8221; yet God emphatically answered, &#8220;I did.&#8221; Moses, empowered by the burning-bush revelation, became both leader and redeemer&#8212;a prophetic picture fulfilled perfectly in Christ. The verse calls us to recognize and submit to God&#8217;s appointed Savior, trusting His sovereign plan even when it runs counter to popular opinion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">The same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">a ruler and redeemer.</span> The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is formed from the noun for "ransom" in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>, and appears to have been chosen to emphasise the parallelism which the speech indicates between Moses and the Christ. In a yet higher sense than Moses, the latter also had been made "a ruler and a redeemer."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="accented">- Him hath God sent</span> for <span class="accented">the same did God send</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both a ruler</span> for a <span class="accented">ruler</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">with the hand</span> for <span class="accented">by the hand</span>, A.V. and T.R. (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>), but giving no clear sense in English. The meaning seems to be that Moses was to rule and save with the strength given him by the angel But it is much simpler to take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as equivalent to the common Hebrew phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, meaning instrumentality, "by means of," "through," and to join it with "did send." The angel who spake to Moses in the bush in the Name of God was God's instrument in sending Moses. When an angel gives a message from God, the words are always given as spoken by God himself (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1-3</a>). In this verse Stephen, having with great oratorical skill entranced their attention by his recital of God's marvelous revelation of himself to Moses, now takes them off their guard, and shews how their fathers treated Moses just as they had treated Jesus Christ; and how God in the case of Moses had chosen and magnified the very man whom they had scornfully rejected; just as now he had exalted Jesus Christ to be a Prince and a Savior, whom they had crucified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Touton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#969;&#971;&#963;&#8134;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#333;us&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3475.htm">Strong's 3475: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Moses, or Mouses of Hebrew origin; Moseus, Moses, or Mouses, the Hebrew lawgiver.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whom</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had rejected</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#961;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;rn&#275;santo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_720.htm">Strong's 720: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps from a and the middle voice of rheo; to contradict, i.e. Disavow, reject, abnegate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the words,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eipontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
