In the biblical context, this is a reminder that God sees beyond outward appearances and actions, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearance. This understanding is crucial in the context of <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, where the early church is grappling with the inclusion of Gentiles. God's knowledge of the heart assures believers that His judgments are just and based on true righteousness.<p><b>showed His approval</b><br>God's approval is demonstrated through His actions, not merely words. In the context of <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, this approval is significant because it validates the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian community without the need for adherence to the full Mosaic Law. This divine endorsement is a pivotal moment in the early church, affirming that salvation and acceptance by God are based on faith and not ethnic or cultural identity. This aligns with the message of <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasizes salvation by grace through faith.<p><b>by giving the Holy Spirit to them</b><br>The giving of the Holy Spirit is a sign of God's acceptance and blessing. In <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>, Peter witnesses the Holy Spirit being poured out on the Gentiles, which serves as a divine confirmation of their inclusion in the covenant community. This event parallels the Pentecost experience in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>, where the Holy Spirit is given to Jewish believers. The Holy Spirit's presence signifies God's active work in the lives of believers, empowering them for service and confirming their status as God's children, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>.<p><b>just as He did to us</b><br>This phrase underscores the equality between Jewish and Gentile believers in the early church. By stating that God gave the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles "just as He did to us," Peter highlights that there is no distinction in the way God interacts with different groups of people. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people. It also echoes the teaching of <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which declares that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, emphasizing the unity and equality of all believers in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient Creator who knows the hearts of all people and shows His approval by giving the Holy Spirit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostles_and_elders.htm">The Apostles and Elders</a></b><br>Leaders in the early church who gathered in Jerusalem to discuss the inclusion of Gentiles in the faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentile_believers.htm">Gentile Believers</a></b><br>Non-Jewish individuals who have come to faith in Jesus Christ and received the Holy Spirit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_council.htm">Jerusalem Council</a></b><br>A significant meeting in the early church where the apostles and elders discussed the requirements for Gentile believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles who spoke at the council, affirming that God gave the Holy Spirit to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows the heart of every individual.

Peter is stressing that the events in Cornelius&#8217;s house (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-48</a>) were initiated and overseen by the Lord, not by human strategy.<p>&#8226; Just as in <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>, where &#8220;God has exalted [Jesus] to His right hand,&#8221; Luke consistently presents the Father as actively directing the spread of the gospel.<p>&#8226; Because the verse begins with &#8220;And,&#8221; it ties back to verse 7, emphasizing continuity with God&#8217;s earlier promise that the Gentiles would hear &#8220;the word of the gospel and believe.&#8221; God is finishing what He started (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who knows the heart</b><p>&#8226; Peter reminds the council that God alone sees the inner person (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). Human leaders might have questioned Gentile inclusion, but the Lord had already examined their hearts and found genuine faith.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Jerusalem believers prayed, &#8220;Lord, You know everyone&#8217;s heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24</a>), asking Him to select an apostle. Now Peter applies that same truth to Gentile converts&#8212;proving God&#8217;s impartiality (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes any tendency to judge by external rites such as circumcision; authentic Christianity is heart-deep (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Showed His approval</b><p>&#8226; The phrase means God publicly testified, declared, or bore witness that Gentile believers were accepted.

That approval is decisive&#8212;no human council can overturn it.<p>&#8226; By placing His stamp of approval first, God settled the matter before any church debate, illustrating <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>: &#8220;Who will bring any charge against God&#8217;s elect?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By giving the Holy Spirit to them</b><p>&#8226; The visible outpouring in <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44-46</a> was unmistakable: they spoke in tongues and magnified God, paralleling Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a> affirms that the Spirit is God&#8217;s seal on every believer, Jew or Gentile.
