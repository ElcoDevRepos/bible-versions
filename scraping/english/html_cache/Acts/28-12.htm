It was a major port and a hub of trade and culture in the ancient world. Founded by Greek settlers in the 8th century BC, it became one of the most powerful cities in the Mediterranean. The city's strategic location made it a natural stopping point for ships traveling between Rome and the eastern parts of the empire. The mention of Syracuse in Acts highlights the spread of the Gospel into diverse cultural and geographical areas, reflecting the fulfillment of Jesus' command to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth" (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>we stayed there three days</b><br>The three-day stay in Syracuse suggests a brief but potentially significant period of rest and resupply for Paul and his companions. In biblical numerology, the number three often signifies completeness or divine purpose, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). This short stay could have provided opportunities for Paul to share the Gospel, as he often did when stopping in new locations. The duration also indicates the practical aspects of ancient travel, where ships would pause to take on provisions or wait for favorable winds. This brief mention underscores the relentless forward movement of Paul's mission, despite the challenges he faced.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/syracuse.htm">Syracuse</a></b><br>A prominent city on the eastern coast of Sicily, known for its rich history and as a major hub of trade and culture in the ancient world.
