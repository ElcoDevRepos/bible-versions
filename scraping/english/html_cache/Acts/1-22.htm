John the Baptist's role was to prepare the way for the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>. His baptism symbolized repentance and the anticipation of the coming Kingdom of God. This period is significant as it sets the stage for Jesus' teachings and miracles, establishing the foundation for His followers' understanding of His mission.<p><b>until the day Jesus was taken up from us</b><br>This phrase refers to the Ascension of Jesus, which is a pivotal event in Christian theology. The Ascension, occurring 40 days after the resurrection, is described in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>. It signifies the completion of Jesus' earthly ministry and His exaltation to the right hand of the Father, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>. This event also marks the transition to the era of the Church, empowered by the Holy Spirit.<p><b>For one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.&#8221;</b><br>The requirement for a new apostle to be a witness of the resurrection underscores the centrality of the resurrection in Christian faith. The resurrection is the cornerstone of the apostles' preaching, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-15</a>. The chosen apostle, Matthias, would join the others in testifying to the reality of Jesus' victory over death, which is essential for the message of salvation and the hope of eternal life.

God safeguarded the gospel by grounding it in verifiable, unified, firsthand accounts, ensuring that every generation can trust the message of a risen Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The <span class="accented">day</span> for <span class="accented">that same day</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">received</span> for <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of these must one become</span> for <span class="accented">must one be ordained to be</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Beginning</span> belongs to <span class="cmt_word">the Lord Jesus</span>. He began to go in and out among his apostles from the time that John baptized, and continued to do so till his ascension, the day that he was received up ("taken up" A.V.), as in ver. 11. This definition of the time of our Lord's public ministry exactly agrees with <a href="/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-25</a>; <a href="/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>; <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3, 4</a>; <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-51</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Must one become a witness</span>, etc. The resurrection of Christ from the dead thus appears to be a cardinal doctrine of the gospel. The whole truth of Christ's mission, the acceptance of his sacrifice, the consequent forgiveness of sins, and all man's hopes of eternal life, turn upon it. All the sermons of the apostles recorded in the Acts and the Epistles also agree with this (see <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2, 3, 4</a>; <a href="/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31, 32</a>; <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>:56, 59; 10:39-41; 13:30, etc.; <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.3; 3:21,22; <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>,etc.). The great care taken to secure competent witnesses is very remarkable. A disciple who had recently joined the company might be mistaken; one who had been the daily companion of Jesus Christ for three years and a half, and knew every gesture and every feature of the Master with perfect certainty, could not be mistaken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/1-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">beginning</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#961;&#958;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(arxamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_756.htm">Strong's 756: </a> </span><span class="str2">To begin.
