In the ancient world, chariots were a common mode of transportation for officials and people of status, indicating the eunuch's high position in the Ethiopian court. The act of stopping the chariot signifies a decisive moment of faith and obedience. This mirrors the urgency and importance of responding to God's call, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the calling of the disciples (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>).<p><b>Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water,</b><br>The act of going down into the water signifies the physical and symbolic act of baptism. Baptism in the early church was typically by immersion, symbolizing the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). The location of this event is traditionally believed to be along the road from Jerusalem to Gaza, a route that would have had access to bodies of water suitable for baptism. This joint action of both Philip and the eunuch emphasizes the communal and public nature of baptism as a declaration of faith.<p><b>and Philip baptized him.</b><br>Baptism here is an outward expression of the eunuch's inward faith and acceptance of Jesus as the Messiah. Philip, one of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, acts as the minister of this sacrament, highlighting the role of church leaders in administering baptism. This event fulfills the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The inclusion of the Ethiopian eunuch, a Gentile and a eunuch, underscores the breaking of cultural and religious barriers, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-5</a>, which speaks of eunuchs being included in God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philip.htm">Philip</a></b><br>One of the seven deacons chosen in <a href="/bsb/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>, Philip is an evangelist who plays a crucial role in spreading the Gospel beyond Jerusalem.

The eunuch&#8217;s immediate command shows a heart already convinced by the gospel Philip had just explained from <a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> (<a href="/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Quick, decisive obedience is the natural response to genuine faith&#8212;just as those at Pentecost &#8220;were cut to the heart&#8221; and acted at once (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; The authority to stop the chariot underscores the eunuch&#8217;s sincerity; he uses his earthly power to submit to heavenly truth, echoing Cornelius who &#8220;ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-48.htm">Acts 10:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water</b><p>&#8226; Going down into the water points to immersion, the pattern seen when Jesus &#8220;came up out of the water&#8221; after His own baptism (<a href="/mark/1-9.htm">Mark 1:9&#8211;10</a>) and when John baptized where &#8220;there was plenty of water&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Immersion pictures burial and resurrection with Christ: &#8220;We therefore were buried with Him through baptism into death&#8230; so we too may walk in newness of life&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Philip and the eunuch go together, highlighting unity in Christ that transcends ethnicity, rank, or background&#8212;fulfilling the Great Commission&#8217;s call to disciple &#8220;all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Philip baptized him</b><p>&#8226; Philip, an evangelist and deacon (<a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>; 21:8), exercises the commission Jesus gave to every disciple-maker&#8212;no special temple or priest required.<p>&#8226; Baptism follows belief, never precedes it. The eunuch first confessed faith in Jesus as the Son of God (<a href="/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>, some manuscripts) and then received baptism, just as Saul was told, &#8220;Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The act seals the eunuch&#8217;s public identification with Christ and introduces him to the visible church, mirroring the 3,000 who &#8220;embraced his message&#8221; and &#8220;were baptized&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/8-38.htm">Acts 8:38</a> records a real moment in which the Ethiopian eunuch responds instantly to the gospel, halts his journey, descends into the water with Philip, and is baptized by immersion. The verse illustrates saving faith that acts without delay, the biblical mode of baptism as a vivid picture of death and resurrection with Christ, and the believer&#8217;s joyful entry into Christ&#8217;s community in simple obedience to the Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">They went down both into the water.</span>--The Greek preposition might mean simply "<span class= "ital">unto</span> the water," but the universality of immersion in the practice of the early Church supports the English version. The eunuch would lay aside his garments, descend chest-deep into the water, and be plunged under it "in the name of the Lord Jesus;" the only formula recognised in the Acts. (See Note on <a href="/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>.) So it was, in the half-playful language in which many of the Fathers delighted, that "the Ethiopian changed his skin" (<a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm" title="Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.">Jeremiah 13:23</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Both went down</span> for <span class="accented">went down both</span>, A.V.
