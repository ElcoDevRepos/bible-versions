This move was prompted by a severe famine in Canaan and Joseph's high position in Egypt, which provided a means of survival for Jacob's family. This event fulfills God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, where God foretold that Abraham's descendants would be strangers in a foreign land. The journey to Egypt also sets the stage for the eventual Exodus, a foundational narrative for the Israelite identity. Geographically, the route from Canaan to Egypt would have been arduous, involving travel through the Sinai Peninsula. <p><b>where he and our fathers died</b><br>Jacob's death in Egypt is recorded in <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>, and he was later buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Canaan, as per his request (<a href="/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>). The phrase "our fathers" refers to the patriarchs, including Jacob's sons, who also died in Egypt. This highlights the beginning of the Israelites' long sojourn in Egypt, which lasted approximately 400 years. The deaths of the patriarchs in Egypt symbolize the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in Israelite history. This period in Egypt is crucial for understanding the development of the Israelite nation and their eventual deliverance, which is a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin. The cultural context of Egypt, with its advanced civilization and different religious practices, would have influenced the Israelites during their stay, setting the stage for the challenges they faced in maintaining their distinct identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Also known as Israel, he is the patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel.
