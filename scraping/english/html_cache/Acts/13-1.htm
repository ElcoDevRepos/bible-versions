It was the third-largest city in the Roman Empire and a major center for trade and culture. The church in Antioch played a crucial role in the spread of the Gospel, being the first place where believers were called "Christians" (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). This church became a hub for missionary activity, highlighting its importance in the early church.<p><b>there were prophets and teachers:</b><br>Prophets in the early church were individuals who received direct revelation from God, often providing guidance and encouragement to the believers. Teachers were responsible for instructing the church in doctrine and the teachings of Jesus. The presence of both roles indicates a well-established and spiritually mature church, capable of discerning and spreading the truth of the Gospel.<p><b>Barnabas,</b><br>Barnabas, originally named Joseph, was a Levite from Cyprus. Known for his generosity and encouragement, he sold a field and gave the proceeds to the apostles (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36-37</a>). He played a pivotal role in introducing Saul (Paul) to the apostles and was a key figure in the early missionary journeys, demonstrating leadership and a heart for ministry.<p><b>Simeon called Niger,</b><br>Simeon, also known as Niger, which means "black" in Latin, suggests he may have been of African descent. His inclusion in the leadership of the Antioch church reflects the diversity and inclusivity of the early Christian community, breaking down ethnic and cultural barriers.<p><b>Lucius of Cyrene,</b><br>Lucius hailed from Cyrene, a city in North Africa. Cyrene had a significant Jewish population, and Lucius's presence in Antioch underscores the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish communities to Gentile regions. This aligns with the church's mission to reach all nations, as commanded by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch),</b><br>Manaen's upbringing with Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, indicates he was likely of noble or influential background. Herod Antipas was known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist and his involvement in the trial of Jesus. Manaen's conversion and leadership in the church highlight the transformative power of the Gospel, reaching even those connected to political power.<p><b>and Saul.</b><br>Saul, later known as Paul, was a former Pharisee and persecutor of Christians who experienced a dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). His inclusion in the Antioch church's leadership marks the beginning of his significant ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles. Saul's background in Jewish law and Roman citizenship uniquely equipped him for his missionary work, bridging cultural and religious divides.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/antioch.htm">Antioch</a></b><br>A significant city in early Christianity, Antioch was a major center for the spread of the Gospel and the location where believers were first called Christians (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/barnabas.htm">Barnabas</a></b><br>A Levite from Cyprus, known for his encouragement and generosity.

From Antioch&#8217;s bustling streets, God assembled encouragers, scholars, cross-bearers, palace insiders, and former persecutors to launch a movement that would reach the ends of the earth. The verse reminds us that when the local church embraces every redeemed background and every God-given gift, the Lord positions His people for world-changing mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now there were in the church that was at Antioch.</span>--The fulness of detail in this narrative suggests the inference that the writer was himself at Antioch at this period.<p><span class= "bld">Certain prophets and teachers.</span>--The two were not necessarily identical, though the higher gift of prophecy commonly included the lower gift of teaching. The former implies a more direct message from God, coming from the Holy Ghost; the latter a more systematic instruction, in which reason and reflection bore their part.<p><span class= "bld">Simeon that was called Niger.</span>--The name seems to indicate the swarth-complexion of Africa; but nothing more is known of him. The epithet was given to him, probably, to distinguish him from the many others of the same name, possibly, in particular, from Simon of Cyrene. (See Note on <a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lucius of Cyrene.</span>--Probably one of the company of "men of Cyprus and Cyrene" (<a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>) who had been among the first evangelists of Antioch. On the ground that Cyrene was famous for its School of Medicine, some writers have identified him with the author of the Acts, but the two names Lucius and Lucas are radically distinct, the latter being contracted for Lucanus.<p><span class= "bld">Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the foster-brother of Herod.</span> Here we enter on a name that has historical associations of some interest. In the early youth of Herod the Great, his future greatness had been foretold by an Essene prophet of the name of Menahem or Manaen (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 10, ? 5). When the prediction was fulfilled, he sought to show honour to the prophet. The identity of name makes it probable that the man who now meets us was the son, or grandson, of the Essene, and that Herod had had him brought up with Antipas as a mark of his favour. Both Antipas and Archelaus were educated at Rome, and Manaen may therefore have accompanied them thither. By what steps he was led to believe in Jesus as the Christ, we can only conjecture; but it seems probable that the austere type of life, so closely resembling that of the Essenes, which was presented by the Baptist, may have impressed him, as he was living in the court of his early companion, and that, through him, he may have been led on to the higher truth, and, in due time, after the Day of Pentecost, have become a sharer in the prophetic gift. The fact that Herod the Great had adorned the city of Antioch with a long and stately colonnade may, perhaps, have given him a certain degree of influence there.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul.</span>--The position of Saul's name at the end of the list seems to indicate that it was copied from one which had been made before he had become the most prominent of the whole company of the prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- At Antioch., in the Church that was there</span> for <span class="accented">in the Church that was at Antioch</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prophets</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">certain prophets</span>, etc., A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">Barnabas</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">as Barnabas</span>, etc., A.V.; <span class="accented">Symeon</span> for <span class="accented">Simeon</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the foster-brother of</span> for <span class="accented">which had been brought up with</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">At Antioch, in the Church</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> rather means "the existing Church," just as at <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "the existing powers," "the powers that be," in <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="accented">The then Church</span> seems mere the meaning than <span class="accented">the Church there.</span> Luke writes from the standpoint of many years later.

It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been <span class="accented">sodalis</span> to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
