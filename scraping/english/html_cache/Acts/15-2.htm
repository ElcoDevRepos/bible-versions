This debate reflects the early church's struggle to define the role of the Mosaic Law in the life of Gentile converts. The sharpness of the debate underscores the importance of the issue, as it pertained to the core of the gospel message. This conflict is reminiscent of other scriptural debates, such as those between Jesus and the Pharisees, where the heart of the law was often in question.<p><b>Paul and Barnabas were appointed</b><br>The appointment of Paul and Barnabas indicates a formal decision by the church at Antioch to send trusted leaders to resolve the issue. This reflects the early church's practice of seeking counsel and resolution through appointed representatives, a practice seen in other parts of the New Testament, such as the selection of deacons in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>. The choice of Paul and Barnabas, both of whom had significant experience with Gentile missions, was strategic and wise.<p><b>along with some other believers</b><br>The inclusion of other believers suggests a communal approach to decision-making and accountability. It also indicates that the issue was of such importance that a broader representation was necessary. This practice of involving multiple witnesses and representatives is consistent with Jewish legal traditions and is echoed in the New Testament's emphasis on the testimony of multiple witnesses (e.g., <a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>).<p><b>to go up to Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "to go up to Jerusalem" is both a geographical and spiritual ascent. Jerusalem, being on a higher elevation, was literally a place one would go up to. Spiritually, it was the center of Jewish worship and the location of the early church's leadership. This journey to Jerusalem signifies the importance of the issue at hand and the need for authoritative guidance from the apostles and elders based there.<p><b>to see the apostles and elders</b><br>The apostles and elders in Jerusalem were recognized as the authoritative leaders of the early church. This reflects the hierarchical structure that was forming within the church, with the apostles, who were eyewitnesses of Christ's ministry, holding a primary role in doctrinal decisions. The elders, likely leaders of the Jerusalem church, were also involved, indicating a collaborative leadership model.<p><b>about this question</b><br>The question at hand was whether Gentile converts needed to adhere to Jewish customs, specifically circumcision, to be saved. This was a pivotal issue for the early church, as it touched on the nature of salvation and the inclusivity of the gospel. The resolution of this question would have significant implications for the church's mission and the unity between Jewish and Gentile believers. This debate and its resolution are foundational for understanding the doctrine of salvation by grace through faith, as later expounded in Paul's letters, particularly Galatians and Romans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A former Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, Paul became a leading apostle to the Gentiles after his conversion on the road to Damascus.

They had proclaimed salvation through faith in Christ. Their converts were now told that they had been teaching a soul-destroying falsehood.<p><span class= "bld">No small dissension and disputation.</span>--The first of the two words was that which had been used by classical writers, like Thucydides (iii. 82) and Aristotle (<span class= "ital">Polit.</span> v. 2), to express the greatest evil of all political societies--the spirit of party and of faction. In <a href="/mark/15-7.htm" title="And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.">Mark 15:7</a>; <a href="/luke/23-19.htm" title="(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)">Luke 23:19</a>, it is used of the "insurrection" in which Barabbas had been the ringleader. That element of evil was now beginning to show itself in the Christian Church.<p><span class= "bld">They determined that Paul and Barnabas.</span>--These were naturally chosen as the representatives of the cause of which they had been the chief advocates. The "certain others" are not named, but the prophets of <a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>, and the men of Cyprus and Cyrene of <a href="/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>, were likely enough to have been chosen, and Titus was apparently taken up as an example of the fruits of St. Paul's labours (<a href="/galatians/1-3.htm" title="Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,">Galatians 1:3</a>). Looking to the Roman name which this disciple bore, it is not unlikely that he may have been among the first to whom the term <span class= "ital">Christian</span> was applied. (See Note on <a href="/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>.) The fulness with which the history of the Council is given, suggests the possibility that St. Luke himself may have been present at it. If not, he must have based his report on materials supplied by St. Paul or one of the other delegates from Antioch, possibly Manaen (<a href="/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - And <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">when therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the brethren</span> (in italics) <span class="accented">appointed</span> for <span class="accented">they determined</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain other of them</span>. One of these would be Titus (<a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>).

The companionship of Barnabas; the agreement of the expression, "I went up by revelation," with the fact that he was sent by the Church, doubtless in obedience to some voice of the Spirit, like that mentioned in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; the occasion, a dispute about the circumcision of Gentile converts; the line taken by Paul and Barnabas in declaring the conversion of the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4, 12</a>; <a href="/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:27), and the result (<a href="/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5, 7, 9</a>), are all strong, not to say conclusive, marks of the identity of the two visits. <span class="cmt_word">The apostles and elders</span>. This phrase marks the constitution of the governing part of the Church of Jerusalem. The addition in vers. 22 and 23 of "the whole Church," and (according to the T.R.) of "the brethren," shows the part the body of the believers had in approving and sanctioning the decisions of the elders.
