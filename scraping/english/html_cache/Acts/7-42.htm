In the Old Testament, God often "turned away" from Israel when they rejected His commandments and pursued other gods (e.g., <a href="/judges/2-12.htm">Judges 2:12-14</a>). This turning away signifies a withdrawal of divine favor and protection, allowing the people to experience the consequences of their actions.<p><b>and gave them over to the worship of the host of heaven</b><br>The "host of heaven" refers to celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars, which were often deified in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This phrase suggests that God allowed Israel to follow their idolatrous inclinations as a form of judgment. This is reminiscent of <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a>, where God "gave them over" to their sinful desires as a consequence of their rejection of Him.<p><b>as it is written in the book of the prophets</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and continuity of the prophetic writings in the Hebrew Scriptures. The "book of the prophets" likely refers to the collection of prophetic books, emphasizing that the message Stephen is conveying is consistent with the longstanding warnings given by the prophets.<p><b>&#8216;Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</b><br>This rhetorical question, drawn from <a href="/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25</a>, challenges the sincerity of Israel's worship during their wilderness journey. While they performed sacrifices, their hearts were often far from God, as evidenced by their frequent lapses into idolatry (e.g., the golden calf incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>). This critique highlights the importance of genuine devotion over mere ritual, a theme echoed by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>, where He condemns worship that is only outwardly performed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>The speaker in <a href="/bsb/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>, Stephen is one of the first deacons of the early church and the first Christian martyr.

Just as James later affirms with &#8220;the words of the prophets agree&#8221; (<a href="/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15</a>), Stephen shows continuity between the prophets and the gospel message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?&#8221;</b><p>Amos&#8217; rhetorical question exposes hollow ritual.

Stephen applies Amos to show that Israel&#8217;s wilderness ancestors and his contemporaries share the same root sin&#8212;heart-level idolatry. Genuine worship demands undivided allegiance; when people insist on substitutes, God may step back and let those substitutes prove their emptiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">The host of heaven.</span>--The word includes the host or army of the firmament, sun, moon, and stars, as in <a href="/2_chronicles/33-3.htm" title="For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.">2Chronicles 33:3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/33-5.htm" title="And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 33:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/8-2.htm" title="And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung on the face of the earth.">Jeremiah 8:2</a>. The sin of Israel was that it worshipped the created host, instead of Jehovah Sabaoth, the "Lord of hosts."<p><span class= "bld">In the book of the prophets.</span>--The term is used in conformity with the Rabbinic usage which treated the Twelve Minor Prophets as making up a single book.<p><span class= "bld">Have ye offered to me . . .?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">did ye offer . . . ?</span> The words are, with one exception, from the LXX. of <a href="/context/amos/5-25.htm" title="Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?">Amos 5:25-26</a>. The narrative of the Pentateuch is inconsistent with the statement that no sacrifices were offered to Jehovah during the forty years' wandering; but the question emphasises the thought which Amos desired to press upon the men of his generation, that Jehovah rejected the divided worship offered to them by a people who were all along hankering after, and frequently openly returning to, the worship of Egypt or Chaldaea. Moloch, and not the true God of Abraham, had been their chosen deity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to serve</span> for <span class="accented">to worship</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> for O <span class="accented">ye house of Israel, have ye offered</span>, etc., <span class="accented">by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</span> A.V.

This, according to Lightfoot, with whom most commentators agree, was in accordance with a very common practice of readers in the schools and pulpits of the Jews, to adapt and accommodate a text to their own immediate purpose, keeping, however, to historical truth. Here Stephen points to the Babylonish Captivity as the punishment of the sins of their fathers, thus warning them of more terrible judgments to follow their rejection of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/7-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned away [from them]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#968;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estrepsen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4762.htm">Strong's 4762: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened from the base of trope; to twist, i.e. Turn quite around or reverse.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave them over</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#941;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pared&#333;ken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3860.htm">Strong's 3860: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and didomi; to surrender, i.e yield up, intrust, transmit.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the worship</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(latreuein)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3000.htm">Strong's 3000: </a> </span><span class="str2">To serve, especially God, perhaps simply: I worship.
