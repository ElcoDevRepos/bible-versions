In the context of <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, Paul and his companions are on a ship caught in a violent storm. The act of eating signifies a temporary reprieve and a moment of hope amidst despair. In biblical times, sharing a meal often symbolized fellowship and unity, which is significant here as it reflects the communal spirit among those on the ship. This moment can be seen as a fulfillment of Paul's earlier assurance that they would survive (<a href="/acts/27-22.htm">Acts 27:22-25</a>), demonstrating God's provision and care.<p><b>they lightened the ship</b><br>The act of lightening the ship was a common practice in ancient maritime travel during storms, aimed at making the vessel more buoyant and easier to control. This practical measure reflects the desperate situation and the crew's efforts to save themselves. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for casting off burdens, akin to <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which encourages believers to lay aside every weight that hinders their spiritual journey. It also highlights the human tendency to rely on practical solutions in times of crisis, even as divine intervention is at work.<p><b>by throwing the grain into the sea</b><br>Grain was a valuable commodity, often transported from Egypt to Rome, and its loss would have been economically significant. This act underscores the severity of the storm and the crew's willingness to sacrifice material wealth for survival. Theologically, this can be seen as a parallel to the call to prioritize spiritual over material wealth, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>. The grain, representing sustenance and life, being cast into the sea, also echoes themes of surrender and trust in God's provision, reminiscent of the Israelites' reliance on manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

The fact that &#8220;all 276 of us&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-37.htm">Acts 27:37</a>) survived ties to earlier assurances given to Paul by an angel (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>) and echoes God&#8217;s care for Noah&#8217;s family during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1, 23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had eaten their fill</b><p>Paul urged them to eat &#8220;for your survival&#8221;

Sharing bread together suggests fellowship and unity, reminiscent of Jesus feeding the multitudes (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>) and instituting the Lord&#8217;s Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>).<p>&#8226;

The tense implies a process of some continuance. The "wheat" which they now cast out may have been part of the cargo which had been reserved by way of provisions. As it was clear that they could no longer continue in the ship, this was no longer required, and the one essential point was to keep her floating till they reached the shore.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> <span class="accented">- Throwing out</span> for <span class="accented">and cast out</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They lightened the ship</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, only here in the New Testament; but it is the technical word for lightening a ship so as to keep her afloat.

Meyer and others think it was merely "the ship's provision," and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand "the wheat" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the men] had eaten their fill,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(koresthentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2880.htm">Strong's 2880: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, sate, glut, feed full, satisfy.
