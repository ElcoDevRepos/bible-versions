Macedonia was significant in early Christian history, as it was home to the churches in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Paul's travels in this area were part of his third missionary journey, during which he revisited many of the churches he had established to strengthen and encourage them. This reflects the apostolic practice of nurturing and maintaining the spiritual health of the early Christian communities.<p><b>and speaking many words of encouragement</b><br>Paul's ministry was characterized by teaching, exhortation, and encouragement. His words were aimed at building up the believers, providing them with spiritual strength and guidance. This aligns with his role as an apostle, tasked with laying the foundation of the church and ensuring its growth in faith and understanding. The encouragement he provided would have included teachings on perseverance, faithfulness, and the hope of the gospel, as seen in his epistles to the churches.<p><b>he arrived in Greece</b><br>Greece, in this context, likely refers to the region of Achaia, where the city of Corinth was located. Corinth was a major center of commerce and culture in the Roman Empire, and it was also a place where Paul had previously spent a significant amount of time during his second missionary journey. The church in Corinth faced many challenges, including issues of division, immorality, and doctrinal confusion, which Paul addressed in his letters to them. His arrival in Greece would have been an opportunity to further address these issues and to continue his work of teaching and strengthening the believers there.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is traveling through the region, offering encouragement and teaching to the early Christian communities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>The region through which Paul travels, known for its early Christian communities, including those in Philippi and Thessalonica.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/greece.htm">Greece</a></b><br>The destination of Paul's journey in this passage, where he continues his missionary work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The groups of believers in Macedonia and Greece who receive Paul's teachings and encouragement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/journey_of_encouragement.htm">Journey of Encouragement</a></b><br>The event of Paul traveling and speaking words of encouragement, which is central to this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_ministry_of_encouragement.htm">The Ministry of Encouragement</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s journey highlights the importance of encouragement in the Christian life.

We may take for granted that St. Paul would revisit the churches which he had himself founded at Thessalonica and Beraea, as well as at Philippi. The names in <a href="/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> indicate that delegates were chosen, probably by his direction, for the great journey to Jerusalem, which he now began to contemplate. <a href="/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a> indicates a yet wider range of activity. He had taken the great Roman road across Macedonia, and going westward to the shores of the Adriatic, had preached the gospel in Illyricum, where as yet it had not been heard.<p><span class= "bld">He came into Greece.</span>--The word Hellas, or Greece, seems used as synonymous with Achaia, the southern province. This may have led to an unrecorded visit to Athens. It certainly brought him to Corinth and Cenchreae. There, we may hope, he found all his hopes fulfilled. Gaius was there to receive him as a guest, and Erastus was still a faithful friend. There, if not before, he found Timotheus, and he had with him Jason of Thessalonica and Sosipater of Ber?a (<a href="/context/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21-23</a>). In one respect, however, he found a great change, and missed many friends. The decree of Claudius had either been revoked or was no longer acted on. Aquila and Priscilla had gone straight from Ephesus to Rome on hearing that they could do so with safety, and with them the many friends, male and female, most of them of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> class, whom he had known in Corinth, and whose names fill so large a space in Romans 16. The desire which he had felt before (<a href="/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>) to see Rome was naturally strengthened by their absence. His work in Greece was done, and he felt an impulse, not merely human, drawing him to the further west. A rapid journey to Jerusalem, a short visit there, to show how generous were the gifts which the Gentile Churches sent to the Churches of the Circumcision, and then the desire of his life might be gratified. To preach the gospel in Rome, to pass on from Rome to the Jews at Cordova and other cities in Spain (<a href="/context/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24-28</a>),--that was what he now proposed to himself.

In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span> is found nowhere else in the New Testament, Achaia being the name of the Roman province. Bengel and others understand Hellas here of the country between Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, especially Attica; which would make it probable that St. Paul revisited Athens. But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">traveling through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(dielth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1330.htm">Strong's 1330: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass through, spread (as a report).
