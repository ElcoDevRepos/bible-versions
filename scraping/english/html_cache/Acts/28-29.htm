Paul had been under house arrest, awaiting trial before Caesar, and took this opportunity to preach to the Jews. His message centered on the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets through Jesus Christ, emphasizing the salvation available to both Jews and Gentiles. This moment is significant as it marks the culmination of Paul's efforts to reach his own people with the message of Christ, as seen throughout the Book of Acts.<p><b>the Jews went away</b><br>The departure of the Jews signifies their reaction to Paul's message. Throughout Acts, Jewish audiences often had mixed responses to the Gospel. In this context, their leaving indicates a rejection or at least a reluctance to accept Paul's teachings. This reflects a broader pattern seen in the New Testament, where the Jewish people, as a nation, often struggled to accept Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, which Paul quotes earlier in <a href="/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26-27</a>.<p><b>disputing sharply among themselves</b><br>The sharp dispute among the Jews highlights the division and controversy that the message of Jesus often caused. This internal conflict is reminiscent of other instances in Acts where the Gospel led to debate and division, such as in <a href="/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4-5</a> in Thessalonica. Theologically, this division can be seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' own words in <a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>, where He stated that He came not to bring peace, but a sword, indicating that His message would divide even close relationships. This division also underscores the transformative and challenging nature of the Gospel, which calls for a radical rethinking of traditional beliefs and practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is under house arrest in Rome, continuing to preach the Gospel to both Jews and Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews.htm">The Jews</a></b><br>- A group of Jewish leaders in Rome who came to hear Paul&#8217;s message about Jesus and the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rome.htm">Rome</a></b><br>- The capital of the Roman Empire, where Paul is held under house arrest, yet freely preaching and teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_preaching.htm">Paul's Preaching</a></b><br>- The event where Paul explains the Gospel, leading to a division among the Jewish listeners.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_reasoning.htm">Great Reasoning</a></b><br>- The intense discussion and debate among the Jews after hearing Paul's message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_the_gospel.htm">The Power of the Gospel</a></b><br>Despite opposition, the Gospel continues to be preached.
