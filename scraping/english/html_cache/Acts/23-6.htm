The Sanhedrin was the Jewish ruling council, and it was divided between Sadducees and Pharisees. The Sadducees were a priestly, aristocratic group who denied the resurrection, angels, and spirits, focusing solely on the Torah. The Pharisees, on the other hand, believed in the resurrection, angels, and spirits, and held to oral traditions alongside the written law. This division is significant as it sets the stage for Paul's strategic approach.<p><b>called out in the Sanhedrin</b><br>Paul's boldness in addressing the Sanhedrin reflects his confidence and understanding of Jewish law and customs. The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish court, and speaking out in such a setting required both courage and authority. Paul's Roman citizenship and Pharisaic background gave him a unique position to address this assembly.<p><b>&#8220;Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.</b><br>By identifying himself as a Pharisee, Paul aligns himself with a group that holds significant influence and respect within the Jewish community. His claim of being a "son of a Pharisee" emphasizes his deep roots and credibility within this tradition. This connection to the Pharisees is strategic, as it immediately creates a bond with part of his audience and highlights his understanding of Jewish law and theology.<p><b>It is because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead</b><br>The resurrection is a central tenet of Christian faith and a point of contention between the Pharisees and Sadducees. By focusing on the resurrection, Paul not only aligns himself with Pharisaic beliefs but also underscores the core message of the Gospel. The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian doctrine, and Paul's hope in the resurrection is both a personal conviction and a theological statement.<p><b>that I am on trial.&#8221;</b><br>Paul's declaration that he is on trial for his belief in the resurrection shifts the focus from political or social accusations to a theological debate. This statement is a masterful move, as it highlights the religious nature of the conflict and exposes the underlying spiritual issues at play. It also serves to divide the Sanhedrin, as the Pharisees would be more sympathetic to his cause, given their shared belief in the resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A former Pharisee and apostle of Jesus Christ, known for his missionary journeys and epistles in the New Testament.

Whether they sat in groups on different sides, after the manner of the Government and Opposition benches in the House of Commons, or whether St. Paul recognised the faces of individual teachers of each sect with whom he had formerly been acquainted, we have no <span class= "ital">data</span> for deciding.<p><span class= "bld">I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.</span>--It is natural, from one point of view, to dwell chiefly on the tact of the Apostle. He seems to be acting, consciously or unconsciously, on the principle <span class= "ital">divide et impera, </span>to win over to his side a party who would otherwise have been his enemies. With this there comes, it may be, a half-doubt whether the policy thus adopted was altogether truthful. Was St. Paul at that time really a Pharisee? Was he not, as following in his Master's footsteps, the sworn foe of Pharisaism? The answer to that question, which obviously ought to be answered and not suppressed, is that all parties have their good and bad sides, and that those whom the rank and file of a party most revile may be the most effective witnesses for the truths on which the existence of the party rests. The true leaders of the Pharisees had given a prominence to the doctrine of the Resurrection which it had never had before. They taught an ethical rather than a sacrificial religion. Many of them had been, like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, secret disciples of our Lord. At this very time there were many avowed Pharisees among the members of the Christian Church (<a href="/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>). St. Paul, therefore, could not be charged with any <span class= "ital">suppressio veri</span> in calling himself a Pharisee. It did not involve even a tacit disclaimer of his faith in Christ. It was rather as though he said, "I am one with you in all that is truest in your creed. I invite you to listen and see whether what I now proclaim to you is not the crown and completion of all your hopes and yearnings. Is not the resurrection of Jesus the one thing needed for a proof of that hope of the resurrection of the dead of which you and your fathers have been witnesses?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V. (as in ver. 1); <span class="accented">a son of Pharisees</span> for <span class="accented">the son of a Pharisee</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">touching</span> for of, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When Paul perceived</span>, etc. Possibly the Pharisees in the Sanhedrim were disgusted at the brutal act of Ananias, and were not sorry to hear him called "a whited wall;" and St. Paul's quick intelligence saw at a glance that the whole council did not sympathize with their president, and divined the cause. With a ready wit, therefore, he proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and, seizing upon the great dogma of the resurrection, which Christians held in common with the Pharisees, he rallied to his side all who were Pharisees in the assembly. <span class="cmt_word">Of Pharisees</span>. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (in the plural), which gives the sense that his ancestors were Pharisees (comp. <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Touching the hope</span>, etc. (see <a href="/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>). The words are somewhat difficult to construe. Some take "the hope and resin'. rection of the dead" for a hendiadys, equivalent to "the hope of the resurrection of the dead." Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> by itself, as meaning "the hope of a future life." Perhaps the exact form of the words is, "Touching the hope and (its ultimate object) the resurrection of the dead I am called in question." The article is omitted after the preposition (Alford). As regards St. Paul's action in taking advantage of the strong party feeling by which the Sanhedrim was divided, there is a difference of opinion. Some, as Alford, think that the presence of mind and skill with which Paul divided the hostile assembly was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise (<a href="/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>; see Homiletics, 1-11) to suggest by his Spirit to those under persecution what they ought to say. Farrar, on the contrary, strongly blames St. Paul, and says," The plan showed great knowledge of character... but was it worthy of St. Paul?... Could he worthily say, 'I am a Pharisee'? Had he any right to inflame an existing animosity?" and more to the same effect (vol. it. pp. 325-328). But it could not be wrong for St. Paul to take advantage of the agreement of Christian doctrine with some of the tenets of the Pharisees, to check the Pharisees from joining with the Sadducees in crushing that doctrine. He had never thrown off his profession as a Jew, and if a Jew, then one of the straitest sect of the Jews, in any of its main features; and if he claimed the freedom of a Roman citizen to save himself from scourging, why not the fact of being a Pharisee of Pharisees to save himself from an iniquitous sentence of the Sanhedrim? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/23-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Paul,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
