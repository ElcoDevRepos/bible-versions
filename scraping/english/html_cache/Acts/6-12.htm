The "people" refers to the general populace of Jerusalem, who were often influenced by religious leaders. The "elders" were respected leaders within the Jewish community, often part of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council. The "scribes" were experts in the Law of Moses, responsible for teaching and interpreting the Scriptures. This coalition against Stephen mirrors the opposition Jesus faced, as seen in <a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>, where similar groups conspired against Him. The act of stirring up suggests manipulation and deceit, tactics often used by those opposing God's messengers throughout biblical history.<p><b>and confronted Stephen.</b><br>Stephen, one of the seven chosen to serve in <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>, was known for his wisdom and the Spirit's power. The confrontation indicates a direct challenge to his teachings and authority. This reflects a common pattern in Acts, where the early church leaders face opposition when preaching the gospel. The Greek term for "confronted" implies an aggressive and hostile encounter, suggesting that Stephen's message was perceived as a significant threat to the established religious order.<p><b>They seized him</b><br>The act of seizing Stephen shows the escalation from verbal confrontation to physical action. This mirrors the treatment of Jesus in the Gospels, where He was also seized by religious authorities (<a href="/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>). The use of force indicates the seriousness with which the religious leaders viewed Stephen's influence and the perceived threat to their authority. It also highlights the growing tension between the early Christian movement and traditional Jewish leadership.<p><b>and brought him before the Sanhedrin,</b><br>The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish court, consisting of 71 members, including the high priest, elders, and scribes. It held significant religious and political power in Jerusalem. Bringing Stephen before the Sanhedrin signifies the gravity of the accusations against him, as this was the same body that condemned Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-64</a>). This setting underscores the continuity of opposition faced by Jesus' followers and the fulfillment of His prophecy that His disciples would be brought before councils (<a href="/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9</a>). The Sanhedrin's involvement also highlights the tension between the nascent Christian faith and established Jewish traditions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stephen.htm">Stephen</a></b><br>A man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, chosen as one of the seven deacons to serve the early church.
