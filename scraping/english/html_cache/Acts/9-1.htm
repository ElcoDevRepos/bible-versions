His actions were driven by a belief that the followers of Jesus, known as "the Way," were heretical and a threat to Judaism. The phrase "breathing out murderous threats" indicates his intense hostility and determination to eradicate the early Christian movement. This period of persecution followed the martyrdom of Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>), which Saul approved. Saul's actions were part of a broader Jewish effort to suppress the nascent Christian faith, which was seen as a blasphemous deviation from traditional Jewish beliefs.<p><b>He approached the high priest</b><br>The high priest at the time was likely Caiaphas, who held the position from AD 18 to 36. Saul's approach to the high priest demonstrates his influential status and his commitment to his cause. The high priest had significant religious and political authority, and Saul sought official sanction to pursue Christians beyond Jerusalem. This reflects the centralized religious authority in Jerusalem and the cooperation between religious leaders and Roman authorities to maintain order. Saul's mission to seek letters from the high priest for the synagogues in Damascus (as described in the following verses) underscores the widespread nature of early Christianity and the perceived need to control its spread.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee known for his persecution of Christians.

During this interval the persecution had probably been continuing. The Greek participle, literally, <span class= "ital">breathing-in, </span>is somewhat more emphatic than the English. He lived, as it were, in an atmosphere of threats and slaughter. It was the very air he breathed. Patristic writers and their followers have not unnaturally seen a half-prophetic parallelism between the language of Jacob, "Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil" (<a href="/genesis/49-27.htm" title="Benjamin shall shred as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.">Genesis 49:27</a>), and this description of one who gloried in being of that tribe (<a href="/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Philippians 3:5</a>), and bore the name of its great hero-king.<p><span class= "bld">Went unto the high priest.</span>--It will be remembered that the high priest (whether we suppose Annas or Caiaphas to be meant) was a Sadducee, and that Saul gloried in being a Pharisee of the straitest sect (<a href="/acts/26-5.htm" title="Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.">Acts 26:5</a>). The temper of the persecutor, however, does not shrink from strange companionship, and the coalition which had been formed against our Lord (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm" title="Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,">Matthew 26:3</a>) was renewed against His followers. If, as is probable, the admission of the Samaritans to the new community had become known at Jerusalem, it would naturally tend to intensify their hatred. It would seem to them as if the accursed people were now allied with the Galileans against the Holy Place, and those who were zealous for its honour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">breathing</span> for <span class="accented">breathing out</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">threatening</span> for <span class="accented">threatenings</span>, A.V.

Schleusner takes the genitives in "threatening and slaughter" as genitives of the thing desired, "punting after threatening and slaughter" (comp. <a href="/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Meyer explains it "out of the threatenings and murder [in his heart] breathing hard at the disciples" - an expression indicating passion. Alford, taking nearly the sense of the A.V., makes "threatenings and slaughter" to be as it were the very material of his breath, whether breathed out or breathed in. Considering that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> means "to breathe in," as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, "to breathe out," and that these two are opposed to each other in Hippocrates (see Schleusner), the A.V. <span class="accented">breathing out</span> cannot be justified; nor is it likely that "Luke the physician" would forget the distinction. The difficulty is to explain the genitive case of "threatenings" and "slaughter." <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>; probably the same person who is so described in <a href="/acts/7-1.htm">Acts 7:1</a> (where see note).
