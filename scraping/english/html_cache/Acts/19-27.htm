The silversmiths, led by Demetrius, were concerned about the financial impact of the spread of Christianity, which threatened their trade of crafting silver shrines of Artemis. This reflects the broader theme in Acts of the gospel challenging existing economic and social structures. The concern for "disrepute" indicates the potential loss of honor and credibility in a society where reputation was crucial for business success.<p><b>but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited</b><br>The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, serving as a major religious, cultural, and economic center. The fear of it being "discredited" underscores the threat Christianity posed to pagan worship. Artemis was a central figure in Ephesian identity, and her temple was a source of civic pride. The challenge to her worship by the Christian message of one true God was seen as a direct attack on the city's cultural heritage and religious traditions.<p><b>and her majesty deposed&#8212;she who is worshiped by all the province of Asia and the whole world.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the widespread veneration of Artemis, not only in Ephesus but throughout the Roman province of Asia and beyond. The term "majesty" reflects the divine status attributed to her, and the fear of her being "deposed" indicates the perceived power of the Christian message to overturn established religious systems. The reference to "the whole world" highlights the extensive influence of Artemis worship, making the spread of Christianity a significant cultural and religious shift. This echoes the broader biblical theme of the gospel's power to challenge and transform global belief systems, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/demetrius.htm">Demetrius</a></b><br>A silversmith in Ephesus who made silver shrines of Artemis.
