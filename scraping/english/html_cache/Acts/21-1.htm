The Greek term used here suggests a painful separation, highlighting the strong bonds of Christian fellowship. This reflects the early church's emphasis on community and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. The emotional departure also underscores the sacrifices made by early missionaries in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>we sailed directly to Cos</b><br>Cos is an island in the Aegean Sea, known in antiquity for its medical school and association with Hippocrates. The direct sailing suggests favorable weather conditions and a well-planned itinerary. This journey is part of Paul's third missionary journey, emphasizing the strategic nature of his travels to spread Christianity. The mention of Cos also highlights the interconnectedness of the Roman Empire, facilitating the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>and the next day on to Rhodes</b><br>Rhodes was a significant cultural and commercial hub, famous for the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The island's strategic location made it an important stop for travelers. Paul's brief stay here indicates his urgency to reach Jerusalem, as mentioned in <a href="/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a>. The journey through such prominent locations underscores the widespread reach of the early church.<p><b>and from there to Patara</b><br>Patara was a major port city in Lycia, Asia Minor, known for its temple of Apollo. It served as a key maritime hub, connecting various parts of the Mediterranean. Paul's stop in Patara is significant as it was a place where he could find a ship bound for Phoenicia, facilitating his journey to Jerusalem. This reflects the logistical considerations in Paul's missionary work and the providence of God in providing means for the spread of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_and_his_companions.htm">Paul and His Companions</a></b><br>The "we" in the passage refers to Paul and his traveling companions, including Luke, the author of Acts.

Like Abraham leaving Haran (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and Jesus setting His face toward Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>), Paul moves forward because the mission matters more than sentiment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we sailed directly to Cos</b><p>&#8226; The straight course (compare <a href="/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>) shows purposeful progress.

It would hardly be within the scope of a Commentary to enter at length into the history of each place. It will be enough to note that Coos was famous both for its wines and its silk fabrics, of fine and almost transparent tissue; that Rhodes, then famous for its Colossus, was one of the largest and most flourishing islands of the Archipelago, and is memorable for us in later history as connected with the history of the Knights Hospitallers of St. John; that Patara was a harbour on the coast of Lycia. For this harbour the ship in which the travellers had left Troas and Miletus was bound, and they had therefore to look out for another.

"Non sine desiderio magno" (Bengel). "He shows the violence of the parting by saying, ' Having torn ourselves away '" (Chrysostom).
