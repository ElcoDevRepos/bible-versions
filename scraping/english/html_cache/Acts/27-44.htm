The context is Paul's journey to Rome, where he was to stand trial. The ship had encountered a violent storm, leading to its destruction. The use of planks and ship parts highlights the resourcefulness and survival instincts of the people on board. This situation reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and protection in dire circumstances. The imagery of clinging to planks can be seen as a metaphor for faith, relying on what God provides to reach safety.<p><b>In this way everyone was brought safely to land.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise of safety. Earlier in <a href="/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>, Paul had assured the crew that no lives would be lost, a promise given to him by an angel. The safe arrival of all passengers underscores the reliability of God's word and His sovereignty over nature. This event can be connected to other biblical narratives where God delivers His people through perilous situations, such as the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. It also prefigures the ultimate salvation offered through Jesus Christ, where believers are brought safely through the trials of life to eternal security. The phrase serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and the power of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who was being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

In exact fulfillment of Paul's prediction in ver. 22. And thus ended the eventful voyage of about four hundred and eighty miles (as laid down in the charts) from Clauda to the Point of Koura on the north coast of Malta. It is one of the striking proofs of the identity of Melita with Malta, that the rate at which it is calculated that a large ship laying to in a gale would drift in twenty-four hours, viz. thirty-six miles, multiplied by thirteen and a half (the number of days occupied by the voyage), gives four hundred and eighty-six miles as the whole distance. (36X13.5 = 486) Smith thinks that the coincidence between "the actual bearing of St. Paul's Bay from Clauda, and the direction in which the ship must have driven," with the wind blowing in the quarter we know it did," is, if possible, still more striking" (pp. 127, 128). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
