This moment occurs in the early church, a time when the apostles were establishing the foundations of Christian community and doctrine. Peter's role as a leader is significant, as he is often seen as the spokesperson for the apostles (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>). His direct approach indicates the seriousness of the situation and his responsibility to maintain the integrity of the church.<p><b>&#8220;is this the price you and your husband got for the land?&#8221;</b><br>This question refers to the sale of property by Ananias and Sapphira, which they claimed to have donated entirely to the church. The early Christian community practiced a form of communal living, where believers shared their possessions (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>). The issue at hand is not the amount of money but the deceit involved. The land sale and subsequent donation were voluntary, but lying about the proceeds was a grave sin against the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-4</a>). This reflects the importance of honesty and integrity in the early church.<p><b>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered,</b><br>Sapphira's response confirms her complicity in the deception. Her agreement with her husband Ananias to lie about the sale price demonstrates a willful act of deceit. This moment highlights the theme of personal responsibility and the consequences of sin. In the cultural context, women were often seen as subordinate to their husbands, but Sapphira's active participation shows her accountability in the matter.<p><b>&#8220;that is the price.&#8221;</b><br>By affirming the falsehood, Sapphira seals her fate. This statement is a direct lie, which leads to her immediate judgment. The severity of the punishment underscores the holiness and purity expected within the church. It serves as a warning to the early Christians about the seriousness of sin and the need for truthfulness. This incident parallels the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>, where deceit led to severe consequences for the community. The narrative emphasizes the importance of transparency and honesty in the life of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' apostles and a leading figure in the early Christian church.

He is not assuming but allowing Sapphira the chance to speak truthfully, echoing God&#8217;s pattern of questioning to expose the heart (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The apostle&#8217;s openness shows pastoral concern and clear leadership, aligning with Christ&#8217;s example of confronting sin while seeking repentance (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Is this the price&#8230;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question targets the exact point of deceit: the money received. By specifying &#8220;the price,&#8221; Peter narrows the discussion to facts, modeling how sin is often revealed through concrete details (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrasing reflects the seriousness of stewardship in the early church, where believers voluntarily laid proceeds at the apostles&#8217; feet (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>). Integrity mattered as much as generosity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8230;you and your husband&#8230;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Mentioning both parties underscores shared responsibility. God holds individuals accountable even within family bonds (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Their conspiracy contrasts with the unity and honesty expected among believers (<a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8230;got for the land?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Property sales were common expressions of love for the community (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). The question reminds readers that the issue is not the possession itself but the pretense.<p>&#8226; Land, a tangible blessing from God, becomes a test of the couple&#8217;s heart loyalty (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered</b><p>&#8226; Sapphira&#8217;s immediate affirmation reveals deliberate falsehood, not misunderstanding. Her response mirrors Ananias&#8217;s earlier lie (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-4</a>), showing calculated agreement.<p>&#8226; The brevity highlights how easily deceitful words can be spoken, fulfilling Jesus&#8217; warning that &#8220;the mouth speaks what the heart is full of&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;That is the price.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; By doubling down, Sapphira seals her own judgment, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;Lying lips are detestable to the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Her statement turns a voluntary gift into a spiritual fraud, demonstrating that deception, not donation size, offends God (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode teaches that the Holy Spirit, who indwells the church, cannot be lied to with impunity (<a href="/acts/5-9.htm">Acts 5:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/5-8.htm">Acts 5:8</a> exposes the heart of deceit cloaked in outward generosity. Peter&#8217;s careful questioning gives Sapphira a final opportunity to confess, yet her deliberate lie confirms shared guilt with Ananias. The verse highlights God&#8217;s demand for integrity, personal accountability, and reverence for the Holy Spirit within the church. Honesty before God and His people is non-negotiable, for truth safeguards the unity, witness, and purity of Christ&#8217;s body.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And Peter answered unto her.</span>--The word does not necessarily imply a previous questioning, but it is probable enough that she came to inquire why her husband had not returned home; perhaps, expecting to find him high in honour. The question asked by Peter gave her an opening for repentance. It had been in her power to save her husband by a word of warning protest. It was now in her power to clear her own conscience by confession. She misses the one opportunity as she had misused the other. The lie which they had agreed upon comes glibly from her lips, and the irrevocable word is spoken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Peter answered</span>, etc., Point's question gave her the opportunity of confessing the fraud had she been penitent. <span class="cmt_word">The land</span> (see note to ver. 1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;&#960;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(Eipe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
