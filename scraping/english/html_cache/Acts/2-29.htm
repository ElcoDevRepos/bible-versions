By inviting his &#8220;brothers&#8221; to consider undeniable facts, Peter leads them to the only logical conclusion: Jesus, not David, is the Holy One who rose.

Josephus relates that vast treasures were buried with him (<span class= "ital">Ant. vii.</span> 15, ? 4), and that John Hyrcanus opened one of the chambers of the tomb, and took out three thousand talents to pay the tribute demanded by Antiochus the Pious (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 8, ? 4). Herod the Great also opened it and found no money, but gold and silver vessels in abundance. The tradition was that he sought to penetrate into the inner vault, in which the bodies of David and Solomon were resting, and was deterred by a flame that issued from the recess (<span class= "ital">Ant. xvi.</span> 7, ? 1). It is difficult to understand how such a treasure could have escaped the plunderer in all the sieges and sacks to which Jerusalem had been exposed; but it is possible that its fame as a holy place may have made it, like the temples at Delphi and Ephesus, a kind of bank of deposit, in which large treasures in coin or plate were left for safety, and many of these, in the common course of things, were never claimed, and gradually accumulated. The monuments now known as the "tombs of the kings" on the north side of the city, though identified by De Sauley with the sepulchres of the house of David, are of the Roman period, and are outside the walls. David and his successors were probably buried in a vault on the eastern hill, in the city of David (<a href="/1_kings/2-10.htm" title="So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.">1Kings 2:10</a>), within the range of the enclosure now known as the <span class= "ital">Haram</span> Area. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I may say unto you freely</span> for <span class="accented">let me freely speak unto you</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">both died and was buried</span> for <span class="accented">is both dead and buried</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tomb</span> for <span class="accented">sepulcher</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>; literally, <span class="accented">men who are my brethren.</span> Observe how gentle and conciliatory the apostle's language is; how exactly in accordance with his own precept (<a href="/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8, 9</a>), "Not rendering railing for railing," etc. In addressing them as <span class="accented">brethren</span>, he silently claims the good will and fairness due to one who was a brother in blood and in the faith of the God of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The patriarch David</span>.

It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang.

He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed.
