The Israelites frequently complained and rebelled against God during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. Despite their disobedience, God continued to guide and provide for them. This endurance is a testament to His covenant faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is described as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness."<p><b>for about forty years</b><br>The forty-year period is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing a time of testing, trial, and preparation. This duration corresponds to the time the Israelites spent wandering in the wilderness due to their lack of faith and disobedience, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>. The number forty is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the forty days and nights of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>), indicating a period of divine testing and preparation.<p><b>in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness, or desert, was a harsh and barren environment, symbolizing both physical and spiritual challenges. It served as a place of purification and dependence on God, where the Israelites learned to rely on His provision, such as manna and water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4, 17</a>:6). The wilderness journey is a type of the Christian life, representing the believer's journey through trials and reliance on God's guidance. It also foreshadows Jesus' own time in the wilderness, where He was tempted by Satan but remained obedient to God (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating patience and endurance with the Israelites during their time in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were led out of Egypt and wandered in the wilderness for forty years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites wandered for forty years as a consequence of their rebellion and unbelief.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who is recounting this history to the people in Pisidian Antioch as part of his sermon in <a href="/bsb/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pisidian_antioch.htm">Pisidian Antioch</a></b><br>The location where Paul and Barnabas are preaching in the synagogue, providing a historical recount of Israel's journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_endurance.htm">God's Patience and Endurance</a></b><br>God&#8217;s patience with the Israelites serves as a powerful reminder of His enduring love and mercy.

Many of the better MSS. versions and early writers give the latter reading, and it obviously falls in far better with the conciliatory drift of St. Paul's teaching than one which implied reproach. The word is found in the Greek of <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a> ("bare thee, as a man <span class= "ital">doth bear</span> his son"), where also some MSS. give the other word, and suggests the inference, already mentioned, that this chapter, as well as Isaiah 1, had been read as one of the lessons for the day.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">For</span> <span class="accented">about</span> for <span class="accented">about</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Suffered he their manners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>).
