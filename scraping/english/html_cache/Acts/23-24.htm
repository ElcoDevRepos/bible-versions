This phrase indicates the seriousness with which the Roman authorities took the threat against Paul&#8217;s life. The provision of mounts suggests a level of respect and care for Paul, who, despite being a prisoner, was a Roman citizen. This act also reflects the Roman emphasis on law and order, as they were responsible for the safety of those under their jurisdiction.<p><b>to take him safely</b><br>The emphasis on safety highlights the danger Paul faced from the Jewish leaders who were plotting to kill him. The Roman commander, Claudius Lysias, was aware of the conspiracy and took measures to protect Paul, demonstrating the Roman commitment to justice and the protection of their citizens. This protection aligns with God&#8217;s providential care over Paul, ensuring that he would continue his mission to preach the Gospel, as previously revealed to him in <a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>, where the Lord assured Paul that he would testify in Rome.<p><b>to Governor Felix</b><br>Governor Felix was the Roman procurator of Judea from approximately AD 52 to 60. His full name was Antonius Felix, and he was known for his harsh and corrupt rule. Felix's governance is historically documented by the Jewish historian Josephus, who describes him as a man who wielded his power with cruelty. The transfer of Paul to Felix was significant because it moved Paul from the immediate threat in Jerusalem to a higher authority in Caesarea, the Roman administrative capital of Judea. This move was part of God&#8217;s plan to bring Paul before rulers and kings, as foretold in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, and ultimately to Rome.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A key figure in the early Christian church, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus.

In the household of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius, there were two brothers, first slaves, then freed-men, Antonius Felix and Pallas. The latter became the chosen companion and favourite minister of the emperor, and through his influence Felix obtained the procuratorship of Judaea. There, in the terse epigrammatic language of Tacitus, he governed as one who thought, in his reliance on his brother's power, that he could commit any crime with impunity, and wielded "the power of a tyrant in the temper of a slave" (Tacit. <span class= "ital">Ann. </span>xii. 54; <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 9). His career was infamous alike for lust and cruelty. Another historian, Suetonius (<span class= "ital">Claud.</span> c. 28), describes him as the husband of three queens, whom he had married in succession:--(1) Drusilla, the daughter of Juba, King of Mauritania and Selene, the daughter of Autonius and Cleopatra. (2) Drusilla, the daughter of Agrippa I. and sister of Agrippa II. (See <a href="/acts/23-24.htm" title="And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.">Acts 23:24</a>.) She had left her first husband, Azizus, King of Emesa, to marry Felix (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7. ? 1). Their son, also an Agrippa, died in an eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7, ? 2).
