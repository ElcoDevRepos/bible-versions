In the context of <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, the Jerusalem Council is addressing the issue of whether Gentile converts to Christianity must adhere to Jewish law, particularly circumcision. The phrase sets up a contrast to the belief that adherence to the law is necessary for salvation.<p><b>we believe</b><br>This expression of belief underscores the unity and shared conviction among the apostles and elders. It reflects the early church's reliance on faith and the teachings of Jesus, rather than on the works of the law. This belief is foundational to Christian doctrine, emphasizing faith over legalistic practices.<p><b>it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus</b><br>The concept of grace is central to Christian theology, highlighting unmerited favor from God. This grace is a gift, not earned by human effort or adherence to the law. The mention of "the Lord Jesus" emphasizes the divine authority and role of Jesus in salvation. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which speaks of salvation by grace through faith.<p><b>that we are saved,</b><br>Salvation is presented as a completed action, emphasizing assurance and security in the believer's relationship with God. This salvation is not contingent on human actions but is a result of divine grace. The use of "we" includes both Jewish and Gentile believers, reinforcing the universality of the gospel.<p><b>just as they are.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase affirms the equality of all believers, regardless of ethnic or cultural background. It reflects the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that there is neither Jew nor Greek in Christ.
