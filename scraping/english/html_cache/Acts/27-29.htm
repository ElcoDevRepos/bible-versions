The Mediterranean Sea, where this event took place, was notorious for its sudden and violent storms. The sailors' fear reflects their awareness of the dangerous coastal areas, particularly around Malta, where hidden reefs and rocky shores posed significant threats to ships. This fear also underscores the human instinct to seek safety and the limitations of human control over nature, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>They dropped four anchors from the stern</b><br>Dropping anchors from the stern, or the back of the ship, was an unusual practice, as anchors were typically dropped from the bow, or front. This action indicates the desperate measures taken to stabilize the ship and prevent it from being driven onto the rocks. The use of four anchors suggests the severity of the storm and the sailors' determination to secure the vessel. In a broader biblical context, anchors symbolize hope and stability, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>, where hope is described as "an anchor for the soul."<p><b>And prayed for daybreak</b><br>Prayer in times of distress is a recurring theme in the Bible, reflecting reliance on divine intervention. The sailors' prayer for daybreak signifies their hope for light and safety, as daylight would allow them to better navigate and assess their situation. This act of prayer, even by those who may not have been believers, illustrates the universal human tendency to seek divine help in crisis. The longing for daybreak can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual enlightenment and deliverance, echoing the biblical motif of light overcoming darkness, as found in <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who is being transported to Rome as a prisoner.

In the battles of the Nile and of Copenhagen, however, Nelson had his ships anchored at the stern, and the fact derives a peculiar interest from the statement that he had been reading Acts 27 on the morning of the engagement. The result of this operation was that the ship was no longer in motion, and would be found, when the morning came, with her head to the shore.

The British navy so anchored at the battles of the Nile, Algiers, and Copenhagen, and it is a earn-men practice of the Levantine caiques at the present day; and an ancient picture of a ship (at Herculaneum) distinctly represents "hawse-holes aft to fit them for anchoring by the stern." They did so in the present case, to obviate the danger of the ship swinging round and getting into breakers, and also that she might be in the best position for running on to the beach as soon as daylight came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/27-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Fearing that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#959;&#946;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(phoboumenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5399.htm">Strong's 5399: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phobos; to frighten, i.e. to be alarmed; by analogy, to be in awe of, i.e. Revere.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we would run aground</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;&#960;&#941;&#963;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekpes&#333;men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1601.htm">Strong's 1601: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ek and pipto; to drop away; specially, be driven out of one's course; figuratively, to lose, become inefficient.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] rocks,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tracheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5138.htm">Strong's 5138: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rough, rugged, uneven.
