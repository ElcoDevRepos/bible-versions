This aligns with the biblical theme of God revealing Himself through signs and wonders. The "tongues" symbolize communication and the spreading of the Gospel, reflecting the reversal of the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). This event marks the beginning of the Church's mission to proclaim the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>like flames of fire</b><br>Fire in the Bible often represents God's presence, purity, and judgment.

The "flames of fire" here signify the Holy Spirit's purifying and empowering presence, preparing the disciples for their mission.

On that day--so it was computed by the later Rabbis, though the Book of Exodus (<a href="/exodus/19-1.htm" title="In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.">Exodus 19:1</a>) seems to leave the matter in some uncertainty--the Israelites had encamped round Sinai, and there had been thunders and darkness and voices, and the great Laws had been proclaimed. It was, that is, an epoch-making day in the religious history of Israel. It was fit that it should be chosen for another great epoch-making day, which, seeming at first to be meant for Israel only, was intended ultimately for mankind.<p><span class= "bld">Was fully come.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">was being accomplished.</span> The word seems chosen to express the fact that the meeting of the disciples was either on the vigil of the Feast-day, or in the early dawn. Assuming the Passover to have occurred on the night of the Last Supper, the Day of Pentecost would fall on the first day of the week, beginning, of course, at the sunset of the Sabbath. So the Churches of East and West have commemorated the day as on the eighth Sunday after Easter. In the Latin nations the name of Pentecost remains scarcely altered. The <span class= "ital">Pfingst</span> of the Germans shows it still surviving in a very contracted form. Some eminent scholars have thought that our <span class= "ital">Whitsun-day</span> represents it after a still more altered form, and that this is a more probable etymology of the word than those which connect it with the <span class= "ital">white</span> garments worn on that day by newly-baptised converts, or with the gift of "<span class= "ital">wit, or</span> wisdom."<p><span class= "bld">With one accord in one place.</span>--Probably in the same large upper room as in <a href="/acts/1-13.htm" title="And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where stayed both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.">Acts 1:13</a>. We may reasonably think of the same persons as being present. The hour, we may infer from <a href="/acts/2-15.htm" title="For these are not drunken, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.">Acts 2:15</a>, was early in the morning, and probably followed on a night of prayer. It is said, indeed, that devout Jews used to solemnise the vigil of Pentecost by a special thanksgiving to God for giving His Law to Israel; and this may well have been the occasion that brought the disciples together (Sch&#8221;ttgen, <span class= "ital">Hor. Hebr. in <a href="/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a></span>). It was, in the mystic language of the Rabbis, the night on which the Law, as the Bride, was espoused to Israel, as the Bridegroom. The frequent occurrence of the Greek word for "with one accord" (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:">Acts 4:24</a>; <a href="/acts/5-12.htm" title="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.">Acts 5:12</a>) is significant as showing the impression made on the writer by the exceptional unity of the new society. Outside the Acts it is found only in <a href="/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Tongues parting asunder</span> for <span class="accented">cloven tongues</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">each one</span> for <span class="accented">each</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There appeared.</span> They had <span class="accented">heard</span> the sound, now they see the tongues of fire, and then they <span class="accented">feel</span> the Spirit working in them (see ver. 34). <span class="cmt_word">Tongues parting asunder</span>. The idea of the <span class="accented">cloven tongue, i.e.</span> a tongue parted into two, which is thought to have been the origin of the miter, is not suggested either by the Greek or by the circumstances, and is clearly a mistaken one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means <span class="accented">distributing themselves</span> or <span class="accented">being distributed.</span> From the central apparition, or rather place of sound, they saw issuing forth many several tongues, looking like small flames of fire, and one such tongue sat upon each one of the brethren or disciples present. <span class="cmt_word">Each one</span>.

For not only must the <span class="accented">all</span> of ver. 1 refer to the same company as was described in the preceding chapter (vers. 15-26), but it is quite clear in ver. 15 of this chapter that Peter and the eleven (ver. 14), standing up separate from the body of the disciples, say of them, "These are not drunken, as ye suppose;" which is a demonstration that those of whom they thus spoke had been speaking with tongues (see also <a href="/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>). St. Augustine, too, says that the hundred and twenty all received the Holy Spirit. To the same effect Meyer, Wordsworth, Alford (who adds, "Not the hundred and twenty only, but all the believers in Christ then congregated at Jerusalem;" so also Lange). Farrar well remarks, "It was the consecration of a whole Church to be all of them a chosen generation, a royal priest- hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people" ('Life of St. Paul,' <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.). Lange says, "Not only the apostles, but all the disciples, were filled with the Holy Ghost. There is a universal priesthood of all believers, and the Holy Ghost is the anointing which consecrates and qualifies for this priesthood" ('On the Acts,' Clark's edit., p. 67). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
