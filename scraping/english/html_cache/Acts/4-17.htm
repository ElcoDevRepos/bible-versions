This reflects the early church's explosive growth and the threat it posed to the established religious order. The message of Jesus' resurrection was revolutionary, challenging the authority and traditions of the Jewish leaders. Historically, the Sanhedrin, the ruling council, sought to maintain control and prevent any uprising that could attract Roman attention and jeopardize their power.<p><b>we must warn them</b><br>The use of the word "warn" indicates an attempt to exert authority and control over the apostles. This reflects the Sanhedrin's strategy of intimidation, a common practice to maintain religious and social order. The warning was not just a suggestion but a directive meant to silence the apostles. This mirrors other biblical instances where God's messengers faced opposition, such as the prophets in the Old Testament who were often warned or persecuted for speaking God's truth.<p><b>not to speak to anyone in this name.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "in this name" refers to the name of Jesus, which holds significant power and authority in Christian theology. The name of Jesus is central to the apostles' message and mission, as seen in <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a> where Peter heals a man in Jesus' name. The leaders' insistence on not speaking in Jesus' name highlights their recognition of its power and their fear of its implications. This connects to the broader biblical theme of the power of God's name, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus. The prohibition also underscores the early church's commitment to proclaiming Jesus despite opposition, a theme that resonates throughout Acts and the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter_and_john.htm">Peter and John</a></b><br>Apostles of Jesus Christ who were preaching the resurrection of Jesus and performing miracles in His name.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanhedrin.htm">Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The Jewish ruling council, composed of religious leaders who were concerned about the spread of Christianity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, a central location for early Christian activity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_of_the_lame_man.htm">The Healing of the Lame Man</a></b><br>A miraculous event performed by Peter and John at the temple gate, which led to their arrest and trial before the Sanhedrin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_name_of_jesus.htm">The Name of Jesus</a></b><br>Central to the apostles' message and the source of the power for the miracles they performed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_jesus'_name.htm">The Power of Jesus' Name</a></b><br>The apostles' ability to perform miracles and preach boldly was rooted in the authority of Jesus' name.

They decide on damage control, fearing that the gospel&#8217;s advance will destabilize their religious authority&#8212;just as Jesus had warned in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> that His followers would be opposed. Earlier, the same council &#8220;were astonished, and they recognized that they had been with Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>), but rather than repent, they scheme to block the good news.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Among the people</b><p>Their anxiety centers on &#8220;the people,&#8221; the common crowd that had just witnessed a lame man walk (<a href="/acts/3-8.htm">Acts 3:8-10</a>). Every miracle fuels public confidence in Christ, threatening the leaders&#8217; influence (<a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47-48</a>). Like Pharaoh hardening his heart when Israelites multiplied (<a href="/exodus/1-9.htm">Exodus 1:9-10</a>), these leaders fear a movement they cannot control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We must warn them</b><p>No discussion of evidence, only a strategy of intimidation. They rely on threats instead of facts, echoing the pattern later in <a href="/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17-18</a> where the apostles are jailed, and in <a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a> where they are flogged. Human authority attempts to silence divine commission, yet <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-4</a> shows the futility of rulers who &#8220;counsel together against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not to speak to anyone in this name</b><p>The clash is ultimately about &#8220;this name,&#8221; Jesus.

Peter and John answer such gag orders with civil disobedience rooted in obedience to God: &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17</a> reveals religious authorities scrambling to suppress the gospel&#8217;s spread by threatening its messengers. Their concern is control, not truth; their tactic is intimidation, not dialogue. Yet the verse underscores that attempts to muzzle the name of Jesus only highlight its power and exclusivity. God&#8217;s message cannot be chained, and faithful believers, emboldened by the Spirit, must keep proclaiming Christ regardless of opposition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/acts/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Let us straitly threaten them.</span>--The Greek gives literally, <span class= "ital">let us threaten them with threats.</span> The phrase gives the Hebrew idiom for expressing intensity by reduplication, as in "blessing I will bless thee" (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;">Genesis 22:17</a>), "dying thou shalt die" (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm" title="But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it: for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.">Genesis 2:17</a>, <span class= "ital">marg.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and, as far as it goes, indicates that St. Luke translated from a report of the speech which Caiaphas had delivered in Aramaic.
