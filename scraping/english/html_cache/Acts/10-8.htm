The context involves Cornelius, a centurion, who had a vision from an angel instructing him to send for Peter. This explanation would have been crucial for the servants and soldier to understand the divine nature of their mission. In biblical times, visions and dreams were common ways God communicated His will, as seen with Joseph in Genesis and Daniel in Babylon. The act of explaining also reflects the importance of testimony and witness in the Christian faith, as believers are called to share their experiences of God's work in their lives.<p><b>and sent them to Joppa</b><br>Joppa, known today as Jaffa, is a port city on the Mediterranean coast of Israel. It holds historical significance as a major seaport in ancient times, mentioned in the Old Testament as the place where Jonah attempted to flee from God's command. The sending of the men to Joppa signifies the beginning of a pivotal moment in the early church&#8212;the inclusion of Gentiles into the Christian faith. This act of sending aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations. The geographical movement from Caesarea to Joppa also symbolizes the expanding reach of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cornelius.htm">Cornelius</a></b><br>A centurion in the Roman army, described as a devout and God-fearing man who prayed regularly and gave generously to those in need.

By articulating the vision, Cornelius ensures that those sent understand they are carrying out God&#8217;s directive, not merely human whim (compare <a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25, 32</a>).<p>&#8226; Sharing revelation builds faith&#8212;his men leave with confidence rather than confusion, similar to how Philip received clear instruction in <a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26&#8211;29</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What had happened</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;What had happened&#8221; points back to the supernatural encounter in <a href="/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3&#8211;6</a>.<p>&#8226; This brief phrase underlines the literal reality of angelic ministry; Scripture presents such encounters as historical fact (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; The vision&#8217;s content centers on two themes: God hears prayers and remembers alms (<a href="/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>), and He is orchestrating a meeting with Peter for further revelation (<a href="/acts/11-13.htm">Acts 11:13&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And sent them</b><p>&#8226; Cornelius moves from hearing to obeying, embodying <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;Be doers of the word.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Obedience here is immediate; no bargaining, no delay. This echoes Abraham&#8217;s swift response in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>.<p>&#8226; Delegating the task shows wise stewardship. Cornelius entrusts the mission to reliable people, anticipating that God&#8217;s plan will unfold through cooperative service (<a href="/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Joppa</b><p>&#8226; Joppa is where Peter is staying with Simon the tanner (<a href="/acts/9-43.htm">Acts 9:43</a>). God precisely aligns locations, proving His sovereignty over geography and timing (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The city had earlier been a place of miraculous outreach when Peter raised Tabitha (<a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36&#8211;42</a>). Returning there links Cornelius&#8217;s story to an existing thread of divine activity.<p>&#8226; Sending Gentile emissaries into a Jewish environment foreshadows the upcoming barrier-breaking unity in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/acts/10-8.htm">Acts 10:8</a> captures humble, prompt obedience to divine revelation. Cornelius clearly communicates the angel&#8217;s message and dispatches trusted men to Joppa, setting the stage for the Gospel&#8217;s breakthrough to the Gentiles. His example challenges us to receive God&#8217;s word as factual, share it openly, and act on it without hesitation, trusting that the Lord knits every detail together for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Having rehearsed</span> for <span class="accented">when he had declared</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">all things</span> for <span class="accented">all these things</span>, A.V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He explained</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#951;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#275;g&#275;samenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1834.htm">Strong's 1834: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lead, show the way; met: I unfold, narrate, declare.
