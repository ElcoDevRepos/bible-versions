Antioch was the third-largest city in the Roman Empire and a hub for missionary activity. It was here that believers were first called Christians (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). Their decision to remain indicates the importance of Antioch as a base for teaching and spreading the Gospel. This city was a melting pot of cultures, making it an ideal location for the dissemination of Christian teachings.<p><b>along with many others</b><br>The presence of "many others" suggests a thriving Christian community in Antioch. This group likely included both Jewish and Gentile believers, reflecting the church's growing diversity. The mention of "many others" highlights the collaborative nature of early Christian ministry, emphasizing that the work of spreading the Gospel was not limited to apostles but involved a broader community of believers.<p><b>teaching and preaching</b><br>Teaching and preaching were central to the ministry of the early church. Teaching involves explaining and interpreting the Scriptures, while preaching is the proclamation of the Gospel message. This dual approach ensured that new converts were not only evangelized but also discipled, growing in their understanding of the faith. This reflects the Great Commission's call to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>the word of the Lord</b><br>The "word of the Lord" refers to the message of Jesus Christ, His life, death, and resurrection, and the salvation available through Him. This phrase underscores the divine authority and inspiration behind the message being taught and preached. It connects to the broader biblical narrative, where the "word of the Lord" is a recurring theme, signifying God's communication to humanity (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). The focus on the "word" highlights the centrality of Scripture and the Gospel in the life of the early church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>A former Pharisee and persecutor of Christians, Paul became a leading apostle to the Gentiles after his conversion on the road to Damascus.

Looking to the later history of the Church of Antioch, it is not improbable that we may think also of the martyr Ignatius, and Euodius, afterwards Bishop of Antioch, as among those who were thus active, though they were not prominent enough, when St. Luke wrote, to be specially named. Ignatius was said to have been, together with Polycarp, a disciple of St. John (<span class= "ital">Mart. Ignat.</span> c. 3), while another tradition represents him as a follower of Peter. It is possible that the dispute between St. Peter and St. Paul, referred to in <a href="/context/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11-13</a>, occurred during this period, but the evidence on the whole tends to connect it with St. Paul's visit to Antioch in <a href="/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> <span class="accented">- But Paul</span> for <span class="accented">Paul also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tarried</span> for <span class="accented">continued</span>, A.V. It is at this time that Meyer and other commentators (see ver. 1, note) place Peter's visit to Antioch mentioned in <a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>. But it is quite inconceivable that Peter, with all the influence of the Jerusalem Cornell fresh upon him, and after the part he himself took in it, and when his own emissaries, Silas and Judas, had just left Antioch, should act the part there ascribed to him. Nor is it within the region of probability that, so soon after the council, any should have come "from James" to unsay what James had said and written at the council. We may with much confidence place Peter's visit to Antioch before the council, as suggested in note to ver. 1. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/acts/15-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Paul</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
