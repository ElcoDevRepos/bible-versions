These promises are foundational to Jewish faith and are seen as fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as indicated in passages like <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<p><b>our twelve tribes</b><br>The twelve tribes represent the entirety of Israel, descended from the twelve sons of Jacob. Despite historical divisions, such as the split into the northern and southern kingdoms, the hope of the tribes remains unified in the expectation of the Messiah. This reflects the continuity of God's promises to all of Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-28</a>.<p><b>are hoping to see fulfilled</b><br>The hope for fulfillment is a central theme in Jewish eschatology, with expectations of a messianic age.

The earliest appearance of the fable is in the apocryphal. <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_esdras/13-40.htm" title="Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.">2 Esdras 13:40-46</a>, where they are said to have gone to "a country where never man kind dwelt, that they might there keep the statutes which they never kept in their own land."
