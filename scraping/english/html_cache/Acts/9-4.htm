Falling to the ground is a common biblical response to a theophany or divine presence, indicating reverence, fear, or submission. Similar reactions are seen in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> and <a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>, where individuals fall prostrate before God's glory. This act signifies the overwhelming power and authority of the divine presence Saul encountered.<p><b>and heard a voice say to him</b><br>Hearing a voice from heaven is a significant motif in Scripture, often indicating a direct communication from God. In the Old Testament, God frequently spoke to His prophets in this manner, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a> and <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>. The voice Saul hears is authoritative and personal, marking a pivotal moment of divine intervention in his life.<p><b>&#8220;Saul, Saul,</b><br>The repetition of Saul's name is a Hebraic expression of emphasis and urgency. This form of address is used in other biblical instances, such as when God calls Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> and when Jesus addresses Martha in <a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41</a>. It underscores the importance of the message and the personal nature of the call.<p><b>why do you persecute Me?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the intimate connection between Jesus and His followers, as persecution of believers is equated with persecution of Christ Himself. This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where He identifies with His people. Theologically, it underscores the unity of Christ with the Church, His body, as elaborated in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>. Saul's persecution of Christians is thus seen as a direct affront to Jesus, emphasizing the seriousness of his actions and the need for his transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul_of_tarsus.htm">Saul of Tarsus</a></b><br>A zealous Pharisee known for persecuting Christians.

He said, Yes.">Acts 22:27</a>; <a href="/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>, do we find the Hebrew form of the Benjamite name. It is as though he, who gloried in being above all things a Hebrew of the Hebrews, heard himself claimed as such by Him who spoke from heaven, called as Samuel had been called of old (<a href="/context/1_samuel/3-4.htm" title="That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.">1Samuel 3:4-8</a>), and having to decide whether he would resist to the end, or yield, saying with Samuel, "Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth." The narrative implies that the persecutor saw the form of the Son of Man as well as heard His voice, and to that visible presence the Apostle afterwards refers as a witness to him of the Resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1Corinthians 15:8</a>). If we ask as to the manner of the appearance, it is natural to think of it as being such as had met the gaze of Stephen. The martyr's words, "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (<a href="/acts/7-56.htm" title="And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.">Acts 7:56</a>), had then seemed to the fiery zeal of the Pharisee as those of a blasphemer. Now he too saw the Son of Man in the glory of the Father stretching forth His hand, not now, as He then had done, to receive the servant who was faithful even unto death, but, in answer to that servant's dying prayer, to transform the persecutor into the likeness of his victim. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/acts/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Fell upon</span>, for <span class="accented">fell to</span>, A.V. Some, as Lord Lytlelton and Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 48), from the expressions, "fell to the ground," "fell to the earth," infer that Saul was "himself mounted, and his followers some mounted and some on foot." And Farrar also, far other reasons, supposes that Saul and his companions rode horses or mules. The journey, he says, was nearly a hundred and fifty miles, and the roads rough, bad, and steep; and Saul was traveling as the <span class="accented">legate or</span> the high priest. Still it is strange that no one expression should point distinctly to the party being on horseback, which "falling to the earth," or "ground," certainly do not.
