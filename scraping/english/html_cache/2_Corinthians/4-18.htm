In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the challenges and sufferings faced by believers. The "seen" refers to the tangible, material world, which includes trials, persecutions, and the transient nature of life. This aligns with <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. The call to fix our eyes on the unseen is a call to live by faith, trusting in God's promises and eternal truths.<p><b>but on what is unseen</b><br>The "unseen" represents the spiritual realm and eternal truths that are not visible to the human eye. This includes the presence of God, the work of the Holy Spirit, and the hope of eternal life. In <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>, Paul reiterates this by stating, "For we live by faith, not by sight." The unseen is also connected to the kingdom of God, which Jesus often described in parables as something not immediately apparent but of immense value and eternal significance.<p><b>For what is seen is temporary</b><br>The temporary nature of the seen world is a reminder of the fleeting nature of earthly life and possessions. This echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, where life is described as a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The temporary nature of the world is a call to prioritize spiritual over material wealth, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, urging believers to store up treasures in heaven rather than on earth.<p><b>but what is unseen is eternal</b><br>The eternal nature of the unseen underscores the everlasting reality of God's kingdom and the believer's future hope. This eternal perspective is central to Christian doctrine, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which promises eternal life to those who believe in Jesus Christ. The unseen includes the eternal glory that far outweighs present sufferings, as Paul describes earlier in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>. This eternal focus encourages believers to endure hardships with the assurance of a future that is secure and everlasting in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage them in their faith and to remind them of the eternal perspective they should maintain.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

The "look" is that of one who contemplates this or that as the end or goal for which he strives. The "things that are seen" are, of course, all the incidents and circumstances of the present life; the "things that are not seen" (the very phrase of <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>) are the objects of faith, immortality, eternal life, the crown of righteousness, the beatific vision. These things are subject to no time-limits, and endure through all the ages of God's purposes. The others are but for a brief season, and then are as though they had not been. Striking as the words are, they find an echo in the words of a contemporary seeker after wisdom: "These things (the things which most men seek after)," says Seneca (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> lix.), "are but objects of the imagination, and present a show of being but for a time . . . Let us give our minds to the things which are eternal."<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While we look not at the things which are seen.</span> The Greek suggests more of a reason, "Since we are not gazing at things visible" (see <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Things which are not seen.</span> The negative is the <span class="accented">subjective</span> negative.

That is, temporary, transitory, phantasmal, a passing world; for which reason we do not fix our gaze or our aim upon it. But the things which are not seen are eternal The clause is important, as showing that eternity is not a mere extension of time, but a condition qualitatively different from time. The "things eternal" exist as much now as they will ever do. We are as much living in eternity now as we ever shall be. The only difference will be that we shall then see him who is now unseen, and realize the things which now are only visible to the eye of faith. This is one of the passages of St. Paul which finds a close parallel in Seneca ('Ep.,' 59).
