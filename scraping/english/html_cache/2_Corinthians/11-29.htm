The term "weak" can refer to physical, emotional, or spiritual frailty. Paul identifies with the weaknesses of others, reflecting the heart of a true shepherd who shares in the struggles of his flock. This echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>, where Paul states, "To the weak I became weak, to win the weak." His approach is reminiscent of Christ's own compassion and identification with humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>, where Jesus is described as a high priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses. Paul's willingness to share in the weaknesses of others demonstrates the sacrificial love that is central to Christian ministry.<p><b>Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with grief?</b><br>Here, Paul addresses the issue of sin within the community. The phrase "led into sin" suggests a stumbling or falling away from the path of righteousness, which was a concern in the early church. Paul&#8217;s reaction, "I do not burn with grief," indicates a profound emotional response to the spiritual failings of others. This burning grief can be seen as a righteous indignation and sorrow, similar to the zeal Jesus displayed when He cleansed the temple (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>). Paul's grief over sin reflects the heart of God, who desires holiness among His people. This phrase also connects to <a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>, where believers are encouraged to restore those caught in sin with a spirit of gentleness, highlighting the importance of community accountability and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, expressing his deep empathy and concern for their spiritual well-being.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges.

When a brother or sister is fragile in faith, he steps into that weakness himself.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a> he had already written, &#8220;To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak.&#8221; His life is patterned after the Lord who &#8220;sympathizes with our weaknesses&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This stance is not mere empathy; it is active identification:<p>&#8211; He bears their weight, echoing <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, &#8220;Carry one another&#8217;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8211; He restrains his own liberty for their sake, matching <a href="/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1 and 15</a>:1, where the strong are urged to &#8220;bear with the failings of the weak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By calling himself &#8220;weak,&#8221; Paul shatters any notion of spiritual elitism. He lives out <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9&#8211;10</a> where God&#8217;s strength is perfected in weakness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with grief?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Led into sin&#8221; can also be rendered &#8220;caused to stumble&#8221; (compare <a href="/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>). Paul&#8217;s concern is for believers who, through pressure or bad example, fall into moral or doctrinal error.<p>&#8226; His response is to &#8220;burn&#8221; (literally blaze) with grief and indignation, mirroring the zeal Jesus showed in <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a> when He looked on hardness of heart &#8220;with anger, grieved at their stubbornness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Three dimensions of this burning concern:<p>&#8211; Protective: He warns against putting a stumbling block before others (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-12.htm">1 Corinthians 8:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8211; Restorative: He labors to bring the fallen back, much like his tearful appeal in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>, written &#8220;out of great distress and anguish of heart &#8230; with many tears.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Confrontational: He is ready to discipline unrepentant sin in the church (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-2.htm">2 Corinthians 13:2</a>) because unchecked sin harms the whole body.<p>&#8226; His burning grief shows that Christian love is not passive tolerance but an active, holy passion for the purity and welfare of others (see Jude 23, &#8220;save others, snatching them from the fire&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s two questions reveal a heart that shares both the frailty and the failures of God&#8217;s people. When believers are weak, he becomes weak with them, lending strength through solidarity. When they are lured into sin, his spirit ignites with sorrow and righteous indignation, driving him to protect, restore, and, if necessary, confront. Such leadership models Christ&#8217;s own compassion and calls every believer to bear one another&#8217;s burdens with holy zeal and humble dependence on the Lord&#8217;s power made perfect in weakness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Who is weak and I am not weak . . .?</span>--The words obviously spring from a recollection of all that was involved in that "rush" of which he had just spoken. Did any come to him with his tale of body-sickness or soul-sickness, he, in his infinite sympathy, felt as if he shared in it. He claimed no exemption from their infirmities, was reminded by every such tale of his own liability to them. The words that follow have a still stronger significance. The word "offended" (better, <span class= "ital">made to stumble</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> led to fall by a temptation which the man has not resisted) suggests the thought of some grievous sin, as distinct from weakness; and the dominant sense of the word, as in <a href="/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell.">Matthew 5:29-30</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8-9</a>; <a href="/context/mark/9-42.htm" title="And whoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.">Mark 9:42-43</a>; <a href="/mark/9-45.htm" title="And if your foot offend you, cut it off: it is better for you to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:">Mark 9:45</a>; <a href="/mark/9-47.htm" title="And if your eye offend you, pluck it out: it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:">Mark 9:47</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm" title="Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.">1Corinthians 8:13</a>, is that of the sins to which men are led by the temptations of the senses. The other word--to "burn"--is even more startling in its suggestiveness. It had been used in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.">1Corinthians 7:9</a> of the "burning" of sensual passion, and it is scarcely open to a doubt that the associations thus connected with it mingle with its meaning here. Men came to the Apostle with their tales of shame, and told how they had been tempted and had fallen; and here, too, he, in that illimitable sympathy of his, seemed to have travelled with them on the downward road. He felt himself suffused, as it were, with the burning glow of their shame. He blushed with them and for them, as though the sin had been his own. Simply as a word, it should be added, it is equally applicable to any emotion of intense pain or fiery indignation, and it has been so taken by many interpreters. The view which has been given above seems, however, most in harmony with the Apostle's character. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is weak, and I am not weak?</span> See, by way of example, <a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-22.htm">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>; <a href="/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>.
