The "brothers" likely refer to trusted companions such as Titus and others mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-24</a>. This reflects the early church's practice of sending trusted individuals to ensure the integrity of financial matters, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>. The concept of sending emissaries ahead is rooted in the cultural practice of ensuring readiness and honor in gift-giving, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, which speaks to the value of diligent planning.<p><b>and make arrangements for the generous gift you had promised</b><br>The Corinthians had previously committed to a collection for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem, as noted in <a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a>. This act of charity was not only a fulfillment of a promise but also a demonstration of unity within the body of Christ, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries. The term "generous gift" underscores the biblical principle of giving freely and abundantly, as seen in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>. The historical context of the Jerusalem church's need due to famine and persecution adds urgency to this collection.<p><b>This way, your gift will be prepared generously</b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of readiness and willingness in giving. The preparation of the gift reflects the heart's attitude, aligning with the teaching in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> that God loves a cheerful giver. The Greek term used here for "generously" can also imply blessings, suggesting that the act of giving is both a blessing to the receiver and the giver. This principle is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>, which states that a generous person will prosper.<p><b>and not begrudgingly</b><br>Paul contrasts generous giving with giving out of obligation or reluctance. The cultural context of the time valued honor and reputation, and giving begrudgingly would not only diminish the gift's value but also the giver's honor. This aligns with the teaching in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-10.htm">Deuteronomy 15:10</a>, which instructs giving without a grudging heart. Theologically, this reflects the nature of Christ, who gave Himself willingly and joyfully for humanity's redemption, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, encouraging them to prepare their promised gift.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brothers.htm">The Brothers</a></b><br>- Likely Titus and other companions of Paul, sent to ensure the Corinthians' readiness in giving.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthians.htm">The Corinthians</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth, encouraged to fulfill their promise of generosity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_generous_gift.htm">The Generous Gift</a></b><br>- A collection intended to support the impoverished believers in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city where the needy believers resided, who were to benefit from the Corinthians' generosity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_giving.htm">The Heart of Giving</a></b><br>True generosity stems from a willing heart, not from compulsion or reluctance.

There were to be no hurried and unsatisfactory collections then.<p><span class= "bld">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">your bounty, announced before.</span> He is not referring to any notice that he had given, whether in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-2</a> or elsewhere, but to the announcement that he himself had made to the churches of Macedonia. The word for "bounty" (<span class= "ital">eulogia</span>) has, like that for "confidence" in the preceding verse, the interest of an ecclesiastical history attaching to it. Literally, it means a "blessing;" then, as in the LXX. of <a href="/genesis/23-11.htm" title="No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.">Genesis 23:11</a>, <a href="/judges/1-15.htm" title="And she said to him, Give me a blessing: for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.">Judges 1:15</a>, it was used for the "gift," which is the outward token or accompaniment of a blessing. In liturgical language, as connected with the "cup of <span class= "ital">blessing,"</span> it was applied--(1) to the consecrated bread and wine of the Lord's Supper generally; (2) specially to those portions which were reserved to be sent to the sick and other absentees; (3) when that practice fell into disuse, to the unconsecrated remains; and (4) to gifts of bread or cake to friends or the poor, as a residuum of the old distributions at the Agapae, or Feasts of Charity.<p><span class= "bld">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.</span>--The bearing of the last word is not quite obvious. Probably what is meant is this:--"Let your gift be worthy of what you call it, a 'blessing' expressed in act, not the grudging gift of one who, as he gives, is intent on gaining some advantage through his seeming generosity." So understood, it expresses the same thought as Shakespeare's well-known lines:--<p>"The quality of mercy is not strained,<p>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes."<p>It is possible, however, that the word "covetousness" had been applied tauntingly to St. Paul himself, as always "asking for more," always "having his hand" (as is sometimes said of active organising secretaries in our own time) "in people's pockets," and that this is his answer to that taunt. The use of the corresponding verb in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17-18</a>, is strongly in favour of this view. "Don't look on this business," he seems to say, "as a self-interested work of mine. Think of it as, in every sense of the word, a blessing both to givers and receivers." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they would go before unto you.</span> The triple repetition of the word "before" shows how earnest St. Paul is in the matter. The Corinthians had promised largely; it was evident that there had been, or that there was ground for fearing that there might be, some slackness of performance. St. Paul was so unwilling to have seemed inaccurate in what, he had said about them in Macedonia that he wished to give them ample notice before the Macedonian delegates arrived. <span class="cmt_word">Your bounty, whereof ye had notice before;</span> <span class="accented">your previously promised blessing, bounty</span>; literally, <span class="accented">blessing</span>. The mere word should have acted as an inducement to generosity. See the use of the word to express a generous gift in <a href="/genesis/33-11.htm">Genesis 33:11</a>; <a href="/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>, etc. (LXX.); <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>. In this sense it resembles the Hebrew <span class="accented">berachah</span> (<a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">As a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness;</span> <span class="accented">as a blessing, and not as an extortion</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a free gift of your own, and not as something which I had wrung from you, or "got out of you" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17, 18</a>). It is less likely that the word <span class="accented">pleonexia</span> refers to the "parsimony" of the Corinthians, as though the <span class="accented">smallness</span> of their gift would show their greed for large gains. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
