This love is not merely an emotion but a transformative power that influences every aspect of a Christian's life. In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, emphasizing that his ministry and life are driven by the love of Christ. This love is sacrificial, as demonstrated by Christ's death on the cross, and it calls believers to live selflessly. The Greek word for "compels" (&#963;&#965;&#957;&#941;&#967;&#949;&#953;) suggests being held together or constrained, indicating that Christ's love is a controlling force that directs believers' actions. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of love as a fundamental characteristic of God (1 <a href="/john/4-8.htm">John 4:8</a>) and a commandment for believers (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>).<p><b>because we are convinced that One died for all</b><br>The conviction that Christ died for all is central to the Christian faith. This phrase underscores the universality of Christ's atonement, suggesting that His sacrificial death was sufficient for all humanity. The concept of substitutionary atonement is rooted in the Old Testament sacrificial system, where animals were offered to atone for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16). Christ, as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), fulfills and surpasses these sacrifices. The phrase "One died for all" also reflects the prophetic anticipation of a Messiah who would bear the sins of many (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-6</a>). This conviction is foundational for evangelism and the mission of the church, as it affirms the availability of salvation to every person.<p><b>therefore all died</b><br>This phrase indicates the believer's identification with Christ in His death. When Christ died, all who are in Him also died to their old selves and sinful nature. This concept is further explained in <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-8</a>, where Paul discusses the believer's union with Christ in His death and resurrection. Theologically, this signifies the end of the dominion of sin over the believer's life and the beginning of a new life in Christ. The idea of dying with Christ is also a call to live a life of holiness and separation from sin, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states, "I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me." This death to self is a prerequisite for experiencing the fullness of life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and to defend his apostleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, this early Christian community faced challenges such as division, immorality, and questions about Paul's authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus Christ's sacrificial death is the foundation of Paul's message and the driving force behind Christian living.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_death_of_christ.htm">The Death of Christ</a></b><br>The event referenced in this verse, highlighting the significance of Jesus' atoning sacrifice for humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_believers.htm">The Believers</a></b><br>Those who are "compelled" by Christ's love, representing all who have accepted Jesus' sacrifice and are called to live transformed lives.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_compelling_nature_of_christ's_love.htm">The Compelling Nature of Christ's Love</a></b><br>Christ's love is not passive;

St. Paul's uniform use of this and like phrases, however, elsewhere (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-35.htm" title="Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?">Romans 8:35</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-24.htm" title="My love be with you all in Christ Jesus.

Amen.">2Corinthians 13:14</a>), is decisive in favour of the former. It was the Apostle's sense of the love that Christ had shown to him and to all men that was acting as a constraining power, directing every act of every spiritual state to the good of others, restraining him from every self-seeking purpose.<p><span class= "bld">Because we thus judge, that if one died for all.</span>--Better, as expressing the force of the Greek tense, <span class= "ital">Because we formed this judgment.</span> The form of expression implies that the conviction dated from a given time, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> probably, from the hour when, in the new birth of his conversion, he first learnt to know the universality of the love of Christ manifested in His death. Many MSS. omit the "if," but without any real change of meaning. It is obvious that St. Paul assumes the fact, even if it be stated hypothetically. The thought is the same as in the nearly contemporary passage of <a href="/context/romans/5-15.htm" title="But not as the offense, so also is the free gift. For if through the offense of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.">Romans 5:15-19</a>, and takes its place among St. Paul's most unqualified assertions of the universality of the atonement effected by Christ's death. The Greek preposition does not in itself imply more than the fact that the death was <span class= "ital">on behalf of all;</span> but this runs up--as we see by comparing <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>, with <a href="/mark/14-24.htm" title="And he said to them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.">Mark 14:24</a>, <a href="/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a>--into the thought that the death was, in some very real sense, vicarious: <span class= "ital">in the place of</span> the death of all men. The sequence of thought involves that meaning here. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The love of Christ.</span> It matters little whether this be interpreted as a subjective genitive, "Christ's love to man," or as an objective genitive, our love to Christ;" for the two suppose and interfuse each other. St. Paul's usage, however, favours the former interpretation (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-14.htm">2 Corinthians 13:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-24.htm">1 Corinthians 16:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Constraineth</span>. The word means that it compresses us, and therefore keeps us irresistibly to one object (<a href="/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That if one died for all, then were all dead.</span> This is an unfortunate mistranslation and wrong reading for <span class="accented">that one died for all, therefore all died</span>. What compels Paul to sacrifice himself to the work of God for his converts is the conviction, which he formed once for all at his conversion, that One, even Christ, died on behalf of all men (<a href="/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-19</a>) a redeeming death (ver. 21); and that, consequently, in that death, all <span class="accented">potentially</span> died with him - died to their life of sin, and rose to the life of righteousness. The best comments on this bold and concentrated phrase are - "I died to the Law that I might live to Christ;" "I have been <span class="accented">crucified with Christ"</span> (<a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); and, "Ye died, and your life has been hidden with Christ in God" (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>). When Christ died, all humanity, of which he was the federal Head, died potentially with him to sin and selfishness, as he further shows in the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
