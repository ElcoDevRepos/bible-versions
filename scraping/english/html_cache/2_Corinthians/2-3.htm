His previous letter, often identified as the "severe letter," was written to address issues within the Corinthian church, such as immorality and division. This phrase highlights the importance of written communication in the early church, where letters served as a primary means of instruction and correction.<p><b>so that on my arrival</b><br>Paul's intention to visit Corinth underscores the itinerant nature of his ministry. The phrase indicates his desire for a personal presence, which was crucial for resolving conflicts and strengthening relationships. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where face-to-face interaction was valued for resolving disputes and building community.<p><b>I would not be grieved</b><br>Paul's emotional investment in the Corinthian church is evident. His grief would stem from unresolved issues or continued disobedience. This reflects the pastoral heart of Paul, who deeply cared for the spiritual well-being of the churches he founded. The emotional language also connects to other instances in Scripture where leaders express sorrow over the spiritual state of their people, such as Moses with the Israelites.<p><b>by those who ought to make me rejoice</b><br>The expectation of joy from the Corinthians indicates their potential for positive change and growth. Paul sees them as capable of bringing him joy through their repentance and obedience. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of joy in the fellowship of believers, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>, where Paul refers to the Philippians as his "joy and crown."<p><b>I had confidence in all of you</b><br>Paul's confidence reflects his faith in the transformative power of the Holy Spirit working within the believers. Despite previous issues, he trusts in their ability to respond positively to his correction. This confidence is rooted in the biblical principle of hope and redemption, as seen in <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>, where Paul speaks of the God of hope filling believers with joy and peace.<p><b>that you would share my joy</b><br>The mutual sharing of joy emphasizes the communal aspect of the Christian faith. Paul envisions a restored relationship where both he and the Corinthians experience joy. This reflects the biblical theme of unity and fellowship, as seen in <a href="/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>, which speaks of the goodness and pleasantness of brethren dwelling together in unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and expressing his pastoral care and concern.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>- A major city in ancient Greece where the church Paul is addressing is located.

By addressing issues ahead of time, he hoped to avoid the pain that comes when leaders must confront ongoing disobedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>). The pattern is simple: deal with sin early, enjoy fellowship later.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by those who ought to make me rejoice</b><p>The Corinthian believers were his spiritual children (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>), the very ones who should have been his delight (<a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>). When the church lives in holiness, leaders rejoice (3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>); when it tolerates sin, it breaks their hearts.

The pronoun, which does not refer to anything that has been actually said, shows with what definiteness certain passages in his first letter were stamped upon his memory. The question might be asked, "Why had he written so sharply?" And he makes answer to himself that the result had been what he had intended: that his motive in so writing as to give pain had been to avoid giving and receiving pain when he came in person. He wanted his visit to be one of unmixed joy for himself, and if so, it could not fail, looking to their mutual sympathy, to give his disciples joy also.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I wrote this same unto you.</span> <span class="accented">And I wrote</span>. He meets the tacit objection. If you shrink from causing us pain, why then did you write to us in terms so severe? The "I wrote" may be what is called the epistolary aorist, and will then be equivalent to our "I write:" "What I <span class="accented">write</span> to you now has the very object of sparing you a painful visit." If the aorist has its more ordinary sense, it refers to the First, and not to the present Epistle; and this seems the better view, for the "I wrote" in ver. 9 certainly refers to the First Epistle. <span class="accented">This same thing</span>; namely, exactly what I have written (whether in this or in the former Epistle).
