This approach reflects the New Testament emphasis on voluntary acts of love and generosity, as seen in the teachings of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/5-42.htm">Matthew 5:42</a>, <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>). The early church, as described in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, practiced communal sharing, but it was always voluntary. Paul&#8217;s method here aligns with the principle of free will, which is a consistent theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing that God desires willing hearts rather than obligatory compliance (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>but I am testing the sincerity of your love</b><br>Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, encouraging them to demonstrate the authenticity of their love. This testing is not for Paul's benefit but for the Corinthians to examine their own hearts. The concept of testing is prevalent in Scripture, often used by God to refine and prove the faithfulness of His people (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>). The sincerity of love is a hallmark of true Christian faith, as love is the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>) and the defining characteristic of a disciple of Christ (<a href="/john/13-35.htm">John 13:35</a>).<p><b>through the earnestness of others</b><br>Paul refers to the Macedonian churches, whose generosity despite their poverty serves as an example (<a href="/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-5</a>). The Macedonians' earnestness is a model for the Corinthians, illustrating how genuine love manifests in action. This comparison is not meant to shame but to inspire. The early church often used examples of faithfulness to encourage others, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>, the "faith chapter," which recounts the deeds of faithful individuals throughout biblical history. The earnestness of others serves as a tangible benchmark for the Corinthians to measure their own commitment and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and encouraging them in their faith and practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth, known for their spiritual gifts but also for their struggles with moral and doctrinal issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonian_churches.htm">Macedonian Churches</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter as an example of generosity despite their poverty, serving as a model for the Corinthians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>The intended recipients of the collection Paul is organizing, experiencing poverty and in need of support from other Christian communities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A fellow worker with Paul, who is involved in the collection for the Jerusalem church and serves as a trusted messenger to the Corinthians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_of_love.htm">Sincerity of Love</a></b><br>True love is not just spoken but demonstrated through actions.

Giving to the Jerusalem believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm">2 Corinthians 8:4</a>) is not to feel like a tax collected under compulsion. In <a href="/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a> he had similarly said, &#8220;I say this as a concession, not as a command.&#8221; Scripture consistently shows that voluntary obedience pleases God more than forced compliance&#8212;think of <a href="/exodus/35-21.htm">Exodus 35:21</a> where the tabernacle gifts came from &#8220;everyone whose heart was willing.&#8221; When we read this verse today, we can be sure Scripture is showing us that true generosity can never be legislated; it must spring from a willing heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but I am testing</b><p>Instead of commanding, Paul is &#8220;testing,&#8221; or proving what is already there. The aim is not to trip them up but to reveal spiritual maturity, much like God &#8220;tested Abraham&#8221; in <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a> to display authentic faith. Peter echoes this idea: &#8220;the proven character of your faith&#8230; is more precious than gold&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). The Corinthians&#8217; response would reveal the metal of their discipleship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sincerity of your love</b><p>Love in Scripture is always more than sentiment. Jesus said, &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). John added, &#8220;Let us love not in word and speech, but in action and truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). Paul wants the Corinthian believers to demonstrate genuine affection for their brothers and sisters by sharing their resources. Gifts given in love become a practical expression of the gospel they profess.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the earnestness of others</b><p>Paul points to the Macedonian churches, who &#8220;in the midst of severe trials&#8230; overflowed into rich generosity&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>), as a living illustration. Their zeal becomes a mirror in which Corinth can see its own reflection. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a> calls us to &#8220;spur one another on to love and good deeds.&#8221; The Macedonians&#8217; example stirs up holy competition&#8212;an eagerness to excel in grace for God&#8217;s glory, not for ego.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/8-8.htm">2 Corinthians 8:8</a> shows that genuine Christian giving is voluntary, reveals authentic faith, manifests real love, and is inspired by the devoted example of fellow believers. God invites each of us to let our open hands confirm the sincerity of our hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I speak not by commandment.</span>--The English, and, indeed, the Greek also, is to some extent ambiguous, and leaves us uncertain whether he disclaims merely the tone of command or the sanction of a divine authority.
