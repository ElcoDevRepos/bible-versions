Achaia (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Corinth, and perhaps Cenchreae also) had been ready <span class= "ital">last year.</span> The urgency of his present appeal indicates a latent misgiving whether he had not unconsciously over-stated the fact, and had mistaken the "will" that had shown itself for an actual readiness to send off the money whenever it was called for.
