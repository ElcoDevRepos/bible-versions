The term "servants" reflects a position of humility and dedication, echoing the biblical theme of servanthood seen in figures like Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>) and Jesus Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). The concept of servanthood is central to Christian life, where believers are called to serve God and others, following the example of Christ who came not to be served, but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>we commend ourselves in every way</b><br>Paul speaks of commending oneself, which means to present oneself as worthy of respect or approval. This is not about boasting but demonstrating integrity and faithfulness in ministry. The apostle Paul often defended his ministry against accusations and misunderstandings (<a href="/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</a>). The phrase suggests a life that reflects the values and teachings of Christ, serving as a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>in great endurance</b><br>Endurance is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, highlighting the need for perseverance in the face of trials. This endurance is not merely human effort but is empowered by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>). The early church faced persecution and hardship, and endurance was essential for maintaining faith and witness. This endurance is also a reflection of Christ's own perseverance through suffering (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>in troubles, hardships, and calamities</b><br>These terms describe the various forms of suffering and challenges faced by Paul and early Christians. "Troubles" can refer to general afflictions, "hardships" to more specific difficulties, and "calamities" to severe trials. The early church often faced persecution from both Jewish and Roman authorities, as well as internal conflicts (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). These experiences are part of the Christian journey, where believers are called to share in Christ's sufferings (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) and rely on God's strength to overcome them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, addressing issues of ministry, suffering, and the Christian life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

Just as Jesus said, &#8220;If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>), and as Paul elsewhere insists, &#8220;Am I now trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). Their identity as God&#8217;s servants frames everything that follows: whatever happens, their loyalty is to the Master.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We commend ourselves in every way</b><p>The apostle is not boasting but pointing to tangible evidence that validates his message. The life of the messenger must match the truth of the message (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). Paul&#8217;s &#8220;commendation&#8221; is the consistent, Spirit-enabled character that backs up his preaching&#8212;an open letter read by all (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</a>). Integrity, humility, and love make the gospel believable to watching eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In great endurance</b><p>Before listing any specific trials, Paul highlights the overarching attitude: endurance. The word pictures steadfast perseverance through prolonged strain. <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a> urges us to &#8220;run with endurance the race set out for us,&#8221; while <a href="/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3-4</a> shows endurance producing maturity. Paul&#8217;s ministry did not sputter at the first sign of resistance; it stayed the course because God&#8217;s strength held him fast (<a href="/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Endurance is not passive; it is active trust.<p>&#8226; Endurance proclaims that Christ is worth more than comfort.<p>&#8226; Endurance invites others to explore the power that sustains it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In troubles</b><p>These are the everyday pressures, the constant &#8220;squeezes&#8221; of life and ministry. Jesus was clear: &#8220;In the world you will have tribulation&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). Paul&#8217;s troubles included rejection, criticism, misunderstanding, and spiritual warfare (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>). Yet each trouble became an opportunity to &#8220;taste and see that the LORD is good&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>) and to display the peace that passes understanding (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hardships</b><p>Hardships move beyond ordinary pressures to the costly sacrifices demanded by faithfulness. Paul told Timothy, &#8220;Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>). He endured hunger, sleeplessness, and manual labor (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>). Hardships refine motives, strip away self-reliance, and spotlight the sufficiency of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Expect hardship; do not be surprised (<a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Treat hardship as &#8220;light and momentary affliction&#8221; compared to eternal glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Support one another so no one suffers alone (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And calamities</b><p>Calamities refer to extreme, life-threatening crises&#8212;shipwrecks, riots, imprisonments, severe persecutions (<a href="/bsb/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a>). Such moments demonstrate in vivid color &#8220;the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>). When God&#8217;s servants survive calamity with faith intact, observers see a living echo of Daniel in the lions&#8217; den or the three men in the fiery furnace&#8212;God still delivers.<p>Key truths:<p>&#8226; Calamity cannot cancel God&#8217;s call (<a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Deliverance may be physical, but it is always spiritual (<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Calamity quickens hope in the coming kingdom, where every tear is wiped away (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4</a> shows Paul measuring ministry success not by ease or applause but by faithful service proved under pressure. As God&#8217;s servants we make the gospel attractive when, empowered by the Spirit, we display unwavering endurance in everyday troubles, costly hardships, and even overwhelming calamities. In each arena Christ&#8217;s strength shines through our weakness, validating both the messenger and the message.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">But in all things approving ourselves as the</span> <span class= "bld">ministers of God.</span>--Better, as keeping up the connection with <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2Corinthians 5:12</a>, <span class= "ital">as ministers of God commending ourselves.</span> He harps, as it were, upon that phrase. Yes, he does commend himself; but how? He looks back on his life of labour and sufferings and challenges comparison. Can others, with their letters of commendation, point to anything like this? The word "ministers" in the Greek is in the nominative case, while the English at least suggests that it is in the objective after the verb. What he means is that he, as the minister of God should do, commends himself by acts and not by words. It is obvious that what follows was likely to expose him to a repetition of the cynical sneer, but of this his generous indignation makes him nobly regardless.<p><span class= "bld">In much patience . . .</span>--Better, as elsewhere, <span class= "ital">endurance.</span> The word has a much stronger meaning than our English "patience." (See Notes on <a href="/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>; <a href="/luke/21-19.htm" title="In your patience possess you your souls.">Luke 21:19</a>.) The general term is naturally followed by a specification of details. It is not, perhaps, easy to specify what he refers to under each head. Possibly he used such words, as we habitually use them, without a formal classification. The root-idea of the first word of the triad is that of being pressed upon; of the second, that of a constraint that leaves no choice of action; of the third, that of being so hemmed in that there is no room to move.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Approving ourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">commending ourselves</span>, He is again referring to the insinuation, which had evidently caused him deep pain, that he was not authorized to preach, as his Judaic opponents were, by "letters of commendation" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</a>) from James or from the ciders at Jerusalem. His credentials came from God, who had enabled him to be so faithful. <span class="cmt_word">As the ministers of God</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>). The article should be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">In much patience.</span> Christ had forewarned his apostles that they would have much to endure, and had strengthened them by the promise that "he that endureth to the end shall be saved" (<a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In afflictions.</span> This word, as we have seen, is one of the haunting words in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In necessities.</span> St, Paul was poor, and was often in want (<a href="/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In distresses.</span> The same word which occurs in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>. It means "extreme pressure" (literally, <span class="accented">narrowness of space</span>), and is a climax of the other words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Rather,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(all&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
