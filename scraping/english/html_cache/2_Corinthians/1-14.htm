This reflects the ongoing relationship and communication between Paul and the Corinthian church. The phrase suggests that while the Corinthians have grasped some aspects of Paul's message, there is still room for growth in their comprehension. This partial understanding can be seen in the context of 1 Corinthians, where Paul addresses various misunderstandings and issues within the church. The phrase also highlights the importance of spiritual maturity and discernment in the Christian life.<p><b>that you may boast of us</b><br>Paul speaks of mutual boasting, which in this context refers to a sense of pride and confidence in the work God is doing through each other. This is not a worldly boasting but a recognition of God's grace and power at work. In <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>, Paul reminds believers to boast in the Lord, indicating that any boasting should ultimately glorify God. The idea of boasting in one another underscores the unity and partnership in the gospel mission, as seen in Paul's relationship with other churches, such as the Philippians (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>).<p><b>just as we will boast of you</b><br>Paul expresses his confidence and pride in the Corinthians, anticipating a future time when he can fully celebrate their faith and growth. This mutual boasting is rooted in the transformative work of Christ in their lives. It reflects the deep bond and affection Paul has for the church, as seen in his other letters, such as <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19-20</a>, where he refers to the Thessalonians as his glory and joy. This phrase also points to the accountability and encouragement that should exist within the body of Christ.<p><b>in the day of our Lord Jesus</b><br>This phrase refers to the eschatological hope of Christ's return, a central theme in Paul's teachings. The "day of our Lord Jesus" is a time of judgment and reward, where believers will be held accountable for their lives and ministries. Paul often speaks of this day as a motivation for holy living and faithful service (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>). The anticipation of this day encourages believers to remain steadfast and to invest in relationships that will bear eternal fruit. It also serves as a reminder of the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the consummation of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and defending his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, members of the church in Corinth, who had a complex relationship with Paul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_our_lord_jesus.htm">Day of our Lord Jesus</a></b><br>- Refers to the future time of Christ's return, a significant event in Christian eschatology.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_and_growth.htm">Understanding and Growth</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the importance of growing in understanding and knowledge of spiritual leaders and their teachings.
