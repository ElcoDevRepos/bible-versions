This reflects the selfless nature of Christian ministry, where leaders endure hardships for the sake of the believers. The context of 2 Corinthians highlights Paul's defense of his apostleship and his commitment to the church's well-being, despite opposition and personal trials.<p><b>so that the grace that is extending to more and more people</b><br>The grace mentioned here refers to the unmerited favor of God, which is being spread through the preaching of the Gospel. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where believers are called to make disciples of all nations. The expansion of grace signifies the growth of the early church and the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>may cause thanksgiving to overflow</b><br>Thanksgiving is a natural response to the reception of God's grace. As more people experience salvation, gratitude increases among believers, reflecting the joy and transformation that comes with knowing Christ. This echoes the Psalms, where thanksgiving is a recurring theme (e.g., <a href="/psalms/100-4.htm">Psalm 100:4</a>), and highlights the communal aspect of worship and praise in the early church.<p><b>to the glory of God</b><br>The ultimate purpose of extending grace and the resulting thanksgiving is to glorify God. This is consistent with the chief end of man, as stated in the Westminster Shorter Catechism: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever." The glorification of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>, where God declares that He created people for His glory. The spread of the Gospel and the transformation of lives serve to magnify God's name and demonstrate His power and love to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and significant trade.

As Paul&#8217;s preaching continues despite affliction, more hear and believe (<a href="/acts/13-48.htm">Acts 13:48&#8211;49</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). Notice:<p>&#8226; Grace reaches outward; it &#8220;extends,&#8221; refusing to stay confined to any one group (<a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Each new convert becomes another herald, multiplying the reach still further (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The same grace that saves also sustains&#8212;Paul endures precisely because God&#8217;s grace is sufficient (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>Growth of the gospel, therefore, is inseparably tied to God&#8217;s empowering grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may cause thanksgiving to overflow</b><p>When grace is received, gratitude erupts. The word &#8220;overflow&#8221; pictures a river rising above its banks:<p>&#8226; Believers cannot help but &#8220;abound in thanksgiving&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Gifts of grace produce a chorus of praise that &#8220;overflows in many expressions of thanks to God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Even those who merely observe God&#8217;s work in others join the anthem, as the healed did around Jesus (<a href="/luke/17-15.htm">Luke 17:15</a>).<p>Thanksgiving is not an add-on; it is grace&#8217;s natural fruit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the glory of God</b><p>The flood of gratitude has a destination: God&#8217;s glory. Scripture consistently ties every saving and sustaining act to this goal (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). Here we see:<p>&#8226; God magnifies Himself by rescuing sinners and carrying His servants through trials.<p>&#8226; When thanks rise, they spotlight His character&#8212;His faithfulness, power, and mercy (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The more people reached, the louder and broader the doxology (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>Thus the entire sequence&#8212;from suffering, to grace, to gratitude&#8212;culminates in the public display of God&#8217;s worth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s hardships are neither pointless nor private. God designs them for the church&#8217;s good, uses them to spread His grace ever wider, ignites overflowing thanksgiving in redeemed hearts, and, above all, showcases His own glory. Seeing the chain in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-15.htm">2 Corinthians 4:15</a> encourages us to welcome whatever He allows, confident that every trial can serve the twin purposes of growing His family and amplifying His praise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">For all things are for your sakes.</span>--We can scarcely doubt that he thinks in his own mind, and intends to remind them, of the glorious words of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/3-22.htm" title="Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;">1Corinthians 3:22-23</a>.<p><span class= "bld">That the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many . . .</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">that grace, having abounded by means of the greater part of you, may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</span> The passage is nearly parallel to <a href="/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2Corinthians 1:11</a>. He takes for granted that the grace which he has received has been given in answer to the prayers, if not of all the Corinthians, yet at least of the majority (comp. the same distinction drawn in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6</a>), and he is sure that it will, in its turn, cause their thanksgiving to be as copious as their prayers. The passage is, however, obscure in its construction, and two other renderings of the Greek are grammatically possible, which is more than can be said of the English version: (1) "that grace having abounded, may, for the sake of the thanksgiving of the greater part of you, redound . . ."; and (2) "that grace having abounded, may, by means of the greater part of you, cause thanksgiving to redound . . ."
