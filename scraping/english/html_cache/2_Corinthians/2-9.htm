This reflects his role as an apostle and spiritual father to the church. His letters often served as a means of correction and encouragement, as seen in other epistles like Galatians and Thessalonians. The act of writing was a common method of communication and instruction in the early church, as personal visits were not always possible.<p><b>was to see if you would stand the test</b><br>Paul is referring to a test of obedience and faithfulness. The "test" likely involves the Corinthians' response to his previous instructions, particularly regarding church discipline and reconciliation. This concept of testing is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>, where trials are seen as a means to develop perseverance and maturity. The idea of testing is also present in the Old Testament, where God tests His people to reveal their hearts, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>.<p><b>and be obedient in everything</b><br>Obedience is a central theme in Paul's teachings, emphasizing the importance of following Christ's commands and apostolic instruction. This obedience is not just in specific matters but encompasses all aspects of Christian life. The call to complete obedience is consistent with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love me, keep my commands."

He is not writing aimlessly; he has a definite, Spirit-led intention. Throughout his letters he often explains why he puts pen to parchment:<p>&#8226; &#8220;I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His previous &#8220;severe letter&#8221; (alluded to in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8&#8211;9</a>) aimed to produce godly sorrow leading to repentance, proving his pastoral heart.<p>&#8226; Like a father guiding children, he models the truth that &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), so every word has purpose.<p>Paul&#8217;s purpose, then, is redemptive rather than punitive, loving rather than hostile, confident that God&#8217;s Word accomplishes what it intends (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was to see if you would stand the test</b><p>Here Paul reveals that the Corinthians were in the midst of a proving ground. The &#8220;test&#8221; is not academic but spiritual, showing whether their profession of faith would be matched by perseverance. Consider:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you are approved&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>).<p>&#8226; James echoes this theme: &#8220;Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because&#8230; he will receive the crown of life&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>).<p>Such testing is never cruel; it exposes genuine faith the way fire refines gold (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). Paul&#8217;s letter thus serves as both thermometer and thermostat&#8212;measuring their temperature and helping regulate it toward steadfast maturity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and be obedient in everything</b><p>Obedience is the natural fruit of authentic faith. Paul is not content with partial compliance; he longs for wholehearted submission to Christ. Scripture consistently joins faith and obedience:<p>&#8226; &#8220;We received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus links love and obedience: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Their earlier response had impressed Titus, who &#8220;remembers your obedience&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>), showing that full obedience is both possible and expected.<p>Paul knows that selective obedience quickly erodes into disobedience, so he urges comprehensive surrender&#8212;&#8220;in everything.&#8221; The goal is that Christ would be Lord over every sphere of life, echoing <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>: &#8220;We must obey God rather than men.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul&#8217;s concise statement in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a> pulls back the curtain on his pastoral strategy. He writes with purpose, aiming to test and refine the believers, longing to see them display unwavering obedience in every area of life. Scripture presents this trio&#8212;purpose, testing, obedience&#8212;as hallmarks of genuine discipleship. As we read the verse today, we are reminded that God still uses His written Word to reveal hearts, prove faith, and draw His people into complete, joyful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For to this end also did</span> <span class= "bld">I write . . .</span>--The tense of the Greek verb, which may be what is known as the Epistolary aorist, used by the writer of the time at which he writes, would not be decisive as to what is referred to, and the words may mean: "I write to you thus to see whether you are as obedient now as you were before--in one line of action as in the other." If he refers to the First Epistle, it is to intimate that he gave the directions in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3-7</a>, not only for the removal of a scandal and the reformation of the offender who had caused it, but as a test of their obedience. On the whole, the former interpretation seems preferable. It scarcely seems like St. Paul to make the punishment a trial of obedience. There is a characteristic subtle delicacy of thought in his suggesting that, having shown obedience in punishing they should show it also in forgiving.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to this end also did I write.</span> This is another reason which he gives for the severe tone of his First Epistle.
