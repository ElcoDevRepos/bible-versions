The early church practiced a form of communal sharing, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers sold possessions to support those in need. This phrase emphasizes the principle of mutual aid without causing undue hardship on any single group. The historical context involves a collection for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem, highlighting the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities across different regions. Paul&#8217;s intention is to encourage generosity without imposing a heavy burden, reflecting the biblical principle of bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>) while maintaining balance.<p><b>but that there may be equality</b><br>The concept of equality here is not about absolute sameness but rather about ensuring that no one lacks basic necessities while others have abundance. This reflects the Old Testament principle of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), where debts were forgiven and land was returned to original owners, promoting social and economic balance. Paul&#8217;s teaching aligns with Jesus&#8217; message of love and care for one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>). Theologically, this equality mirrors the spiritual equality believers have in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), where all are one regardless of social or economic status. The call for equality is a practical outworking of the unity and fellowship that should characterize the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth regarding the collection for the saints in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and diversity, where the church Paul is addressing is located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_church.htm">Jerusalem Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the collection, experiencing poverty and persecution, needing support from other churches.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonian_churches.htm">Macedonian Churches</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter as examples of generosity despite their own poverty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A fellow worker with Paul, who was involved in organizing the collection and encouraging the Corinthians to participate.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_equality.htm">Principle of Equality</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of equality within the body of Christ.
