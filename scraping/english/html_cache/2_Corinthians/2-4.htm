His tears signify genuine sorrow and empathy, reminiscent of Jesus weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>). This emotional expression underscores the seriousness of the issues he addressed in his previous letter, likely 1 Corinthians, where he dealt with moral and doctrinal problems within the church.<p><b>I wrote you</b><br>Paul's reference to writing indicates the importance of his epistolary ministry.

This love is sacrificial and Christ-like, reflecting the love of Jesus for His church (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).

He could have protected his own feelings by withdrawing, yet he leaned in.<p>&#8226; This phrase shows that emotional cost often accompanies true shepherding; a painless ministry is usually a shallow one.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not to grieve you</b><p>His goal was never emotional injury.<p>&#8226; Later he explains, &#8220;Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter&#8230; your sorrow led you to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-9</a>). The grief had a purpose.<p>&#8226; Godly correction follows the Father&#8217;s pattern: &#8220;No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul mirrors the heart of God, who &#8220;does not grieve willingly&#8221; (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>) and who warns us &#8220;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>).<p>&#8226; When we must confront sin, this clause reminds us to aim for healing, not humiliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but to let you know how much I love you</b><p>Love is the final word.<p>&#8226; Earlier he told them, &#8220;I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children&#8221; (1 <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Our hearts are open wide&#8230; open wide your hearts also&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-11.htm">2 Corinthians 6:11-13</a>) shows the same transparency.<p>&#8226; He will later say, &#8220;I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 12</a>:15). That is costly, covenantal love.<p>&#8226; Paul is echoing Christ&#8217;s own standard: &#8220;Love one another. As I have loved you&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). Love motivates every hard conversation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a> pulls back the curtain on pastoral correction. Paul&#8217;s tears reveal empathy, his distress shows the weight of shepherding, his intent guards against needless hurt, and his love frames the entire exchange. True biblical confrontation flows from a heart broken for people, yearning for their restoration, and willing to pay an emotional price so that brothers and sisters flourish in holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Out of much affliction and anguish.</span>--Men might think that it had cost him little to write sharp words like those which he has in his mind. He remembers well what he felt as he dictated them--the intensity of his feelings, pain that such words should be needed, anxiety as to their issue, the very tears which then, as at other times (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), were the outflow of strong emotion. Those who were indignant at his stern words should remember, or at least learn to believe this, and so to see in them the strongest proof of his abounding love for them. The heart of St. Paul was in this matter as the heart of Him who said, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten" (<a href="/revelation/3-19.htm" title="As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.">Revelation 3:19</a>). The motive in such a case is not to give pain, but to lead those whom we reprove to feel how much we love them. On the word for "anguish," see Note on <a href="/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25</a>. Looking to the fact that it is used only by St. Luke and St. Paul in the New Testament, we may, perhaps, see in it another example of medical terminology. The anguish was like that of a tight pressure or constriction of the heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. He proceeds to assign the anguish which his First Epistle had caused him as a proof of his confidence that, as a body, they loved him as he loved them. If they had regarded each other with indifference, his letter would not have been written to them, as it were. in his heart's blood. Out of much affliction and anguish of heart. The word for "anguish" means "contraction," "pressure," "spasm" (<a href="/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>). The expression may seem far too strong to be accounted for by the tone of the first letter. Hence some have supposed that he is referring to some other letter now last; and others that ch. 10-13. of this letter, where the whole tone of affection and tenderness suddenly changes into one of impassioned irony and indignation, really belonged to this intermediate letter. There is no need, however, for these hypotheses. In <a href="/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-6:11</a> he had spoken of the errors of the Church with strong reprobation, and the anguish with which he wrote the letter may have been all the more deeply felt because, in expressing it, he put on his feelings a strong restraint. <span class="cmt_word">With many tears.</span> I wrote "out of" anguish, and that anguish showed itself through the tears which bathed my cheeks as I wrote. Such tears, says Calvin, "show weakness, but a weakness more heroic than would have been the iron apathy of a Stoic." It must, however, be remembered that, in ancient times, and in Southern and Eastern lands, men yielded to tears more readily than among Northern nations, who take pride in suppressing as far as possible all outward signs of emotion. In Homer the bravest heroes do not blush to weep in public, and the nervous, afflicted temperament of St. Paul seems to have been often overwhelmed with weeping (<a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19, 31</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm">2 Timothy 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not that ye should be grieved.</span> The "not," by a common Hebrew idiom, means "not only," "not exclusively." His object in inflicting pain was not the pain itself, but the results of godly repentance which it produced (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The love.</span> In the Greek this word is placed very emphatically at the beginning of the clause. <span class="cmt_word">More abundantly.</span> I loved you <span class="accented">more</span> than I loved other converts, and the abundance of my love will give you a measure of the pain I felt. The Philippians were St. Paul's best-beloved converts; but next to them he seems to have felt more personal tenderness for the members of this inflated, wayward, erring Church than for any other community, just as a father sometimes loves best his least-deserving son.
