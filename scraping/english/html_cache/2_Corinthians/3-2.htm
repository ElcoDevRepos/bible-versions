In the ancient world, letters were a primary means of communication, often carrying authority and authenticity. Here, Paul suggests that the lives of the Corinthian believers serve as a living testament to his apostolic work. This concept aligns with the idea that Christians are to be living epistles, reflecting the transformative power of the Gospel (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-2.htm">1 Corinthians 9:2</a>). The metaphor of believers as a letter underscores the visible and tangible evidence of God's work in their lives.<p><b>inscribed on our hearts</b><br>The imagery of inscription suggests permanence and deep affection. In biblical times, inscriptions were often made on stone or metal, signifying durability. By saying the Corinthians are inscribed on his heart, Paul conveys a profound emotional and spiritual connection. This echoes the Old Testament idea of God's law being written on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), indicating an internalized and personal relationship with God. It also reflects the deep pastoral care and concern Paul has for the church.<p><b>known and read by everyone</b><br>This phrase highlights the public nature of the believers' testimony. The transformation in the lives of the Corinthians was evident to all, serving as a witness to the power of the Gospel. In a cultural context where reputation and public perception were significant, the visible change in the believers' lives would have been a powerful testimony to both Jews and Gentiles. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world, visible to all. The idea of being "read by everyone" suggests that the believers' lives were an open book, demonstrating the authenticity and impact of their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.
