The "judgment seat" refers to the Greek term "bema," a raised platform used in ancient times for public speaking or judicial pronouncements. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its legal proceedings and public games, the imagery would resonate with the audience. Theologically, this judgment is distinct from the Great White Throne judgment mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, which is for unbelievers. Here, the focus is on believers being evaluated for their works, not for salvation, which is secured through faith in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>that each one may receive his due</b><br>This part of the verse highlights individual accountability. In the cultural context of the Corinthian church, personal responsibility was a significant theme, as Paul often addressed issues of moral and ethical behavior among believers. The concept of receiving one's due is consistent with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. It underscores the idea that actions have consequences, and believers will be rewarded or suffer loss based on their faithfulness and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>for the things done in the body</b><br>This phrase indicates that the judgment pertains to actions taken during one's earthly life. The "body" signifies the physical life and the choices made therein. In <a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>, Paul reminds believers that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, urging them to honor God with their bodies. This reinforces the notion that our physical actions have spiritual significance and will be evaluated by Christ.<p><b>whether good or bad</b><br>The evaluation of deeds as "good or bad" suggests a moral and ethical standard rooted in God's righteousness. The Greek words used here, "agathos" (good) and "phaulos" (bad), imply not just the outward actions but the motivations and intentions behind them. This aligns with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>, where He speaks of giving an account for every careless word. The judgment is not about condemnation for believers but about assessing the quality of their service and faithfulness to Christ's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and provide guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its diverse population and moral challenges, where the early Christian church faced significant cultural pressures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_seat_of_christ.htm">Judgment Seat of Christ</a></b><br>A metaphorical place where believers will be judged by Christ for their actions and deeds done in the body.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>Every believer will stand before Christ to give an account of their life.

Every believer and every unbeliever &#8211; from the mightiest ruler to the simplest laborer &#8211; stands included. This echoes <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10-12</a>, where we learn &#8220;we will all stand before God&#8217;s judgment seat.&#8221; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> reminds us that &#8220;people are appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221; The universality of judgment underscores God&#8217;s impartiality (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>) and calls each of us to sober self-examination today, not tomorrow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>appear before the judgment seat of Christ</b><p>The &#8220;judgment seat&#8221; (Greek &#8220;b&#275;ma&#8221;) was the raised platform where a governor rendered verdicts. Christ, not a human official, occupies this seat (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>). Believers face their Savior-Judge, the One who loved us and gave Himself for us (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). Knowing His perfect knowledge (<a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a>) and penetrating gaze (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>) keeps us from hiding behind excuses. This appearance is personal and unavoidable; it is not a group hearing but an individual audience with Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that each one may receive his due</b><p>Judgment involves recompense, not mere review. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-15</a> shows rewards for enduring works and loss for worthless works, though salvation itself remains secure. Jesus promises, &#8220;Look, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me, to repay each one according to what he has done&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). The idea is affirmative: Christ longs to reward faithfulness. Yet there is also accountability, reminding us that grace never dismisses responsibility (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the things done in the body</b><p>Our earthly life matters eternally. Daily choices, words, and motives, carried out &#8220;in the body,&#8221; become the material Christ evaluates (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>). <a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a> urges us to present the members of our bodies as instruments of righteousness, because what we do now reverberates forever. Temporary suffering or ease fades, but obedience and service register permanently (<a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whether good or bad</b><p>Nothing falls outside Christ&#8217;s assessment; He weighs both &#8220;gold, silver, precious stones&#8221; and &#8220;wood, hay, straw&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>). &#8220;Good&#8221; points to Spirit-empowered deeds that glorify God (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>). &#8220;Bad&#8221; covers worthless, self-centered actions, even if outwardly religious (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1-6</a>). While believers are not condemned (<a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>), unfaithfulness can lead to loss of reward and a diminished testimony (2 <a href="/bsb/john/8.htm">John 8</a>). Knowing that both categories will surface encourages holy living and urgent repentance (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a> teaches that every person will personally stand before Christ to receive recompense for their earthly deeds. The verse blends comfort and caution: comfort, because the Judge is our Savior who delights to reward; caution, because His judgment is thorough and impartial. Embracing this truth fuels reverent living, faithful service, and daily alignment with the will of the One before whom we will soon appear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">For we must all appear.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">must all be made manifest.</span> The word is the same as that in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a> ("shall <span class= "ital">make manifest</span> the counsels of the heart"), and is obviously used with reference to it.

The word was transferred, when basilicas were turned into churches, to the throne of the bishop, and in classical Greek had been used, not for the judge's seat, but for the orator's pulpit. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We must all appear;</span> rather, for <span class="accented">it is necessary that we must all be made manifest</span>; that we must be shown in our real nature and character. The verb is not the same as in <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>, which occurs in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> The special final judgment is represented as taking place before the <span class="accented">bema</span> of Christ, although in <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a> the best reading is "of God" (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31, 32</a>). St. Paul might naturally use this Roman and Greek idea of the <span class="accented">bema</span>, being too familiar with it in his own experience (comp. <a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21</a>; <a href="/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>; <a href="/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6</a>; <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The things done in the body;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the things</span> (<span class="accented">done</span>) <span class="accented">by the instrumentality of the body</span>. Another reading (which only differs by a single letter from this) is, "the proper things of the body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the things which belong to it, which it <span class="accented">has made its own</span>. St. Paul, always intent on one subject at a time, does not stop to coordinate this law of natural retribution and inexorable Nemesis with that of the "forgiveness of sins" (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>), or with the apparently universal hopes which he seems sometimes to express (<a href="/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17, 18</a>; <a href="/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>). <span class="accented">Omnia exeunt in mysterium</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>According to that he hath done;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with reference to the things he did</span>. The aorist shows that all life will be as it were concentrated to one point. The Pelagians raised questions on this verse about the sinlessness of infants, etc., all of which may be left on one side, as probably nothing was more absolutely distant from the thoughts of St. Paul. Observe that each is to receive the natural issues of what he has done. There is to be an analogy between the sin and the retribution. The latter is but the ripe fruit of the former. We shall be punished by the action of natural laws, not of arbitrary inflictions. We shall reap what we have sown, not harvests of other grain (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be good or bad.</span> St. Paul, who always confines himself to one topic at a time, does not here enter on the question of the cutting off of the entailed curse by repentance and forgiveness. He leaves unsolved the antinomy between normal inevitable consequence and free remission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
