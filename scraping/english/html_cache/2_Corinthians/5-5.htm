The preparation mentioned here refers to the transformation and sanctification process that believers undergo. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, which speaks of believers being created for good works prepared by God. The "very purpose" is the eternal life and glorification that awaits believers, as discussed in the preceding verses about the heavenly dwelling. This preparation is not a random act but part of God's divine plan, echoing <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>, where God predestines, calls, justifies, and glorifies His people.<p><b>and has given us the Spirit as a pledge</b><br>The giving of the Spirit is a significant theme in the New Testament, marking the believer's assurance of salvation and future inheritance. The term "pledge" (Greek: arrabon) is a legal and commercial term used in ancient times to denote a first installment or down payment, guaranteeing the full amount will be paid. This concept is also found in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>, where the Holy Spirit is described as a seal and guarantee of our inheritance. The Spirit's presence in believers is a foretaste of the full redemption and eternal life promised by God.<p><b>of what is to come</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope that Christians hold&#8212;the future resurrection and eternal life with God. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where a new heaven and earth are promised. The "what is to come" is the culmination of God's redemptive plan, where believers will experience the fullness of God's presence and glory. This future hope is a central tenet of Christian faith, encouraging believers to live in light of eternity, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50-58</a>, which speaks of the victory over death through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of believers in a bustling, cosmopolitan city known for its challenges and moral complexities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Referred to as a pledge, or guarantee, of the believer's future inheritance and transformation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who prepares and equips believers for their eternal purpose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_purpose.htm">Eternal Purpose</a></b><br>The ultimate destiny and transformation of believers, which God has prepared them for.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_the_spirit.htm">The Assurance of the Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is given as a pledge, providing believers with assurance and confidence in their salvation and future inheritance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_purpose_and_preparation.htm">God's Purpose and Preparation</a></b><br>God has a specific purpose for each believer, and He actively prepares us for this purpose through the work of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding that we are prepared for an eternal purpose should influence how we live daily, focusing on eternal values rather than temporary concerns.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit is not only a guarantee of our future but also an active presence in our lives, guiding, teaching, and transforming us into the likeness of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_hope_in_action.htm">Faith and Hope in Action</a></b><br>Our faith is strengthened by the knowledge that God has given us His Spirit as a pledge, encouraging us to live with hope and expectation of what is to come.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_5_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 5:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_5_5_God_s_promise_and_purpose.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 5:5 assure us of God's promise and purpose?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Holy_Spirit_s_role_as_a_pledge.htm">What role does the Holy Spirit play as a "pledge" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Living_daily_in_God_s_promise_confidently.htm">How can we live daily with confidence in God's eternal promise?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_2_Cor_5_5_Eph_1_13-14_Spirit_s_role.htm">Connect 2 Corinthians 5:5 with Ephesians 1:13-14 regarding the Holy Spirit's role.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_s_purpose_guide_us_today.htm">How does understanding God's "purpose" influence our actions and decisions today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_5_5_-_God_s_purpose_for_believers.htm">What does 2 Corinthians 5:5 reveal about God's purpose for believers' lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_5_5_Holy_Spirit_as_guarantee.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 5:5 relate to the concept of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_2_Cor_5_5_challenge_eternal_life.htm">In what ways does 2 Corinthians 5:5 challenge our understanding of eternal life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_corinthians_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Corinthians 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_jesus'_visions_in_the_bible.htm">How can believers be united and glorify God together?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_signs_of_saving_faith.htm">What are the signs of saving faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_are_believers_'new'_with_old_flaws.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17 -
