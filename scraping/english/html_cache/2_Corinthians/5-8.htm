The confidence mentioned here is rooted in the promises of God and the work of the Holy Spirit. In the broader context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the challenges and sufferings faced by believers, emphasizing that their hope is not in this world but in the eternal life promised by God. This confidence is also seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, where faith is described as the assurance of things hoped for.<p><b>and would prefer to be away from the body</b><br>Paul expresses a desire that transcends earthly existence, highlighting the temporary nature of our physical bodies. This reflects the biblical teaching that our current bodies are perishable and subject to decay, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>. The apostle's preference to be away from the body underscores the Christian belief in the afterlife and the hope of resurrection, where believers will receive glorified bodies.<p><b>and at home with the Lord.</b><br>This phrase captures the ultimate hope and destination for believers: to be in the presence of the Lord. The concept of being "at home" with the Lord suggests a place of rest, peace, and eternal fellowship with God. This aligns with Jesus' promise in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where He speaks of preparing a place for His followers. The imagery of being at home with the Lord also connects to the idea of the heavenly Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God will dwell with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, they were a diverse group of believers facing various challenges, including issues of morality and doctrinal confusion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Central to Paul's message, Jesus is the one with whom believers desire to be united after death.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_body.htm">The Body</a></b><br>Refers to the physical body, which Paul contrasts with being "at home with the Lord," indicating a spiritual existence after death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_eternal_life.htm">Confidence in Eternal Life</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their eternal destiny with Christ, which should influence how they live their earthly lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_the_physical_body.htm">The Temporary Nature of the Physical Body</a></b><br>Understanding that our physical bodies are temporary can help us prioritize spiritual growth and eternal values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_for_union_with_christ.htm">Desire for Union with Christ</a></b><br>Cultivating a longing to be with the Lord can motivate us to live holy and dedicated lives, reflecting our eternal hope.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_purpose.htm">Living with Purpose</a></b><br>While we are in the body, we should live purposefully, knowing that our ultimate home is with the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_trials.htm">Encouragement in Trials</a></b><br>The assurance of being with Christ can provide comfort and strength during times of suffering and uncertainty.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_5_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_5_8_s_role_in_facing_uncertainty.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 5:8 encourage confidence in facing life's uncertainties?

Earlier verses compare our earthly body to a temporary tent and promise a permanent heavenly dwelling (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1&#8211;7</a>). Since that promise is sure, the logical outcome is bold, joyful anticipation (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and would prefer</b><p>Paul&#8217;s desire is not a morbid fascination with death but a faithful longing for fuller fellowship with Christ. Similar yearnings appear in:<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21&#8211;23</a>&#8212;&#8220;to depart and be with Christ&#8230; is far better.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>&#8212;&#8220;we ourselves&#8230; groan inwardly as we wait eagerly.&#8221;<p>This preference flows from love for the Lord and confidence in His promises, not from disdain for God-given earthly life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be away from the body</b><p>The phrase speaks plainly of physical death&#8212;leaving the mortal body behind. Scripture consistently treats death for believers as:<p>&#8226; A departure from a temporary tent (<a href="/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; A sleep of the body while the person continues with Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; A shedding of what is perishable before putting on what is imperishable (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50&#8211;54</a>).<p>There is no hint of soul-sleep or annihilation; the person remains conscious and active.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and at home with the Lord</b><p>The instant we are absent from the body, we are &#8220;at home&#8221; in the Lord&#8217;s presence.

We know, on the unshakable authority of Scripture, that the moment death separates us from our earthly bodies, we step into the welcoming presence of our Savior. This certainty frees us to serve boldly now and to look ahead with joyful anticipation to our true, eternal home.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">We are confident, I say.</span>--The sentence begun in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2Corinthians 5:6</a> and half broken off is resumed. The apparent sense is that he prefers death to life, because it brings him to the presence of his Lord. At first, this seems at variance with what he had said in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2Corinthians 5:4</a>, as to his not wishing to put off the garment of the present body. Here, however, the expression is not so strong. "We are <span class= "ital">content,"</span> he says, "if death comes before the Coming of the Lord, to accept death; for even though it does not bring with it the glory of the resurrection body, it does make us at home with Christ among the souls who wait for the resurrection." If there still seems to us some shadow of inconsistency, we may look upon it as the all but inevitable outcome of the state which he describes in <a href="/context/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21-25</a>, as "in a strait between two," and of the form of life in which he now finds himself. The whole passage presents a striking parallelism, and should be compared with this. This is, it is believed, an adequate explanation. Another may, however, be suggested. We find the Apostle speaking of certain "visions and revelations of the Lord," of which he says he knows not whether they are "in the body or out of the body" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1</a>). May we not think of him as referring here also to a like experience? "We take pleasure," he says, if we adopt this interpretation, wholly or in part, "even here, in that state which takes us, as it were, out of the body, or seems to do so, because it is in that state that our eyes are open to gaze more clearly on the unseen glories of the eternal world." The fact that both verbs are in the tense which indicates a single act, and not a continuous state, is, as far as it goes, in favour of this explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To be absent,</span> etc.; literally, to be <span class="accented">away from the home of the body, but to be at home with the Lord</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>To be present with the Lord.</span> The hope expressed is exactly the same as in <a href="/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>, except that here (as in ver. 4) he expresses a desire not "to depart," but to be quit of the body without the necessity for death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We are confident,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Tharroumen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2292.htm">Strong's 2292: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be courageous, confident, of good cheer.
