This reflects the tension between Paul and some members of the Corinthian church who questioned his authority and sincerity. The context is Paul's defense of his apostolic authority throughout the letter, particularly against false apostles (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>). The phrase suggests a misunderstanding of Paul's motives, emphasizing that his purpose is not self-defense but the spiritual well-being of the church.<p><b>We speak before God in Christ,</b><br>Paul asserts the sincerity and divine accountability of his words. Speaking "before God" indicates that his message is delivered with a sense of divine witness and responsibility, aligning with the biblical principle that God is the ultimate judge of truth (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). The phrase "in Christ" underscores the union with Christ that defines Paul's ministry, reflecting the New Testament theme of believers' identity and actions being rooted in Christ (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>).<p><b>and all of this, beloved,</b><br>The term "beloved" conveys Paul's deep affection for the Corinthian believers, despite the challenges and criticisms he faces from them. This reflects the pastoral heart of Paul, who consistently expresses love and concern for the churches he planted (<a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>). The phrase "all of this" refers to his efforts and communications, emphasizing that his actions are motivated by love and concern for their spiritual growth.<p><b>is to build you up.</b><br>Paul's ultimate goal is the edification of the church. The concept of "building up" is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, highlighting the importance of spiritual growth and maturity within the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). This aligns with the biblical metaphor of the church as a building or temple, where each believer contributes to the overall structure (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9-17</a>). Paul's focus is on strengthening the faith and unity of the Corinthians, rather than defending his own reputation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

Throughout the letter he has vigorously defended his apostolic call (2 <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; 5:12; 10:10), yet his aim has never been personal vindication.<p>&#8226; This question snaps the church out of a mistaken focus on Paul&#8217;s reputation and back to the gospel mission. Like Jesus before Pilate, Paul is willing to give an answer, but he refuses to turn the ministry into a courtroom drama centered on himself (<a href="/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-3.htm">1 Corinthians 4:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine servants of Christ do not labor to polish their image; they labor to exalt Christ and shepherd His people (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We speak before God in Christ</b><p>&#8226; Paul reminds them that every word he speaks is uttered &#8220;before God.&#8221; His accountability is vertical first, horizontal second (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>; <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In Christ&#8221; anchors his authority.

Knowing God hears every syllable safeguards Paul from manipulation or flattery (2 <a href="/colossians/2-17.htm">Colossians 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the same awareness reshapes conversation, turning casual words into conscious worship (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All of this, beloved, is to build you up</b><p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s explanations, corrections, travels, letters, tears&#8212;&#8220;all of this&#8221;&#8212;have one goal: edification (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:8; 13:10).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;beloved&#8221; reveals his heart.

His model calls believers to speak with God-conscious integrity and to labor for the edification of Christ&#8217;s beloved people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?</span>--Many of the best MSS. present the reading <span class= "ital">palai</span> (long ago), instead of <span class= "ital">palin</span> (again). In this case the sentence is better taken as an assertion, not as a question--"You are thinking, and have been thinking for a long time, that it is to you that we have been making our defence." The Greek verb for "excuse," is that which is always used of a formal <span class= "ital">apologia,</span> or vindication (<a href="/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="/luke/21-14.htm" title="Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what you shall answer:">Luke 21:14</a>; <a href="/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward.

St. Paul deprecates the idea that he has any wish to enter on such a vindication. He is anxious to explain his conduct, as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15-24</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20-24</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="Have I committed an offense in abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?">2Corinthians 11:7-12</a>, but he does not acknowledge that he stands at the bar before their judgment-seat.

The motive which really prompts him to speak as he has spoken is not the wish to clear himself from aspersions, but "before God in Christ,"--under a profound sense that God is his Judge, and that Christ is, as it were, the sphere in which his thoughts revolve,--he is seeking to "edify," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to build them up in the faith or love of God. He has the same end in view in all this perturbed emotion as in the calm liturgical directions of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1Corinthians 14:12-26</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again, think you that we excuse ourselves unto you?</span> The best reading is not <span class="accented">palin</span>, again, but <span class="accented">palai</span>, long ago. This word with the present is an elegant classical idiom, and means, "You have, perhaps, been imagining all this time that I am pleading with you by way of self-defence. Do not think it! You are no judges of mine. My only object is to speak before God in Christ, not to defend myself since I need no defence so far as you are concerned - but to help in building you up, by removing the falsehoods that alienate you from me." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/12-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Have you been thinking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#959;&#954;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(dokeite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1380.htm">Strong's 1380: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb, doko dok'-o of the same meaning; to think; by implication, to seem.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all along</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Palai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3819.htm">Strong's 3819: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of old, long ago, in times past, former.
