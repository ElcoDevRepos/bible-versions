In biblical times, tents were used by nomads and travelers, symbolizing a transient lifestyle. This imagery connects to the Israelites' journey in the wilderness, living in tents as they awaited the Promised Land (<a href="/exodus/33-7.htm">Exodus 33:7</a>). The Apostle Paul, a tentmaker by trade (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>), uses this metaphor to emphasize the temporary state of our earthly existence compared to the eternal nature of the heavenly body promised to believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>).<p><b>we groan under our burdens</b><br>The groaning signifies the deep longing and discomfort experienced in our current mortal state. This echoes <a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>, where creation and believers groan for redemption and the adoption as sons. The burdens refer to the trials, sufferings, and limitations of earthly life, highlighting the human condition's fallen nature since the sin of Adam (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). This groaning is not without hope but anticipates the future glory and redemption in Christ.<p><b>because we do not wish to be unclothed but clothed</b><br>The desire to be "clothed" rather than "unclothed" reflects a longing for the resurrection body rather than a disembodied state. In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53-54</a>, Paul speaks of the perishable putting on the imperishable, indicating the transformation believers will undergo. The imagery of clothing is used throughout Scripture to denote righteousness and salvation (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>), pointing to the ultimate covering provided by Christ's righteousness.<p><b>so that our mortality may be swallowed up by life</b><br>This phrase captures the hope of eternal life overcoming death, a central theme in Christian eschatology. The imagery of being "swallowed up" is reminiscent of <a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>, where Paul declares that "Death is swallowed up in victory." This victory is achieved through Jesus Christ's resurrection, which ensures believers' triumph over mortality (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>). The concept of life here is not merely existence but the abundant, eternal life promised by Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>), fulfilling the prophecy of eternal restoration and communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, they were a diverse group of believers facing various challenges, including issues of morality and doctrinal confusion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent.htm">The Tent</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to describe our earthly bodies, emphasizing their temporary and fragile nature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mortality_and_life.htm">Mortality and Life</a></b><br>Concepts Paul contrasts to highlight the hope of eternal life through Christ, where mortality is overcome by the promise of resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_our_earthly_bodies.htm">The Temporary Nature of Our Earthly Bodies</a></b><br>Our current physical existence is likened to a tent, emphasizing its temporary and fragile nature.

The <span class= "ital">Wisdom of Solomon,</span> which no writer quotes before Clement of Rome, had probably been but recently written (possibly, as I believe, by Apollos), but St. Paul may well have become acquainted with it.<p><span class= "bld">Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Seeing that we do not seek to put off, but to put on a garment.</span> The thought is that of one who thinks that the Coming of the Lord is near.

In this way that which is mortal, subject to death, would be swallowed up of life, as death itself is swallowed up in victory. (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm" title="So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.">1Corinthians 15:54</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we that are,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">for indeed we who are in the tent</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the transitory mortal body. <span class="cmt_word">Do groan.</span> "Oh wretched man that I am I who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"

St. Paul here repudiates the Manichean notion that the body is a disgrace, or in itself the source of evil. He was not like Plotinus, who "blushed that he had a body;" or like St. Francis of Assist, who called his body "my brother the ass;" or like the Cure d'Ars, who (as we have said) spoke of his body as "ce cadavre." He does not, therefore, desire to get rid of his body, but to "clothe it over" with the garment of immortality. Incidentally this implies the wish that he may be <span class="accented">alive</span> and not <span class="accented">dead</span> when the Lord returns (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-54</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mortality</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the mortal</span>; <span class="accented">that which is mortal</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Might be swallowed up of life.</span> As in the case of Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), who entered into life otherwise than through "the grave and gate of death." St. Paul wishes to enter the "building from God" without having been first buried in the collapse of the "soul's dark cottage battered and decayed." He desires to put on the robe of immortality without stripping off the rent garb of the body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[while] we are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8004;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
