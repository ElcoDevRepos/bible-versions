His apostleship is not self-appointed but is by the will of God, emphasizing divine authority and calling. This is consistent with his conversion and commission on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>). His role as an apostle is foundational to the early church, as he is tasked with spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles (<a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15-16</a>).<p><b>and Timothy our brother</b><br>Timothy is mentioned as a co-sender of the letter, indicating his close partnership with Paul in ministry. Timothy is a trusted companion and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, having been mentored by him (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). His inclusion signifies the unity and fellowship among early Christian leaders. Timothy's presence also lends credibility and support to the message being conveyed.<p><b>To the church of God in Corinth</b><br>The church in Corinth was established by Paul during his second missionary journey (<a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a>). Corinth was a major city in ancient Greece, known for its commerce and diverse population. The church faced numerous challenges, including moral and doctrinal issues, which Paul addresses in his letters. The phrase "church of God" underscores the divine ownership and sanctity of the congregation.<p><b>together with all the saints throughout Achaia</b><br>Achaia was a Roman province in southern Greece, with Corinth as its capital. By addressing "all the saints," Paul extends his message beyond the local church to include believers throughout the region. This reflects the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and the universal nature of the church. The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, highlighting their holy calling and identity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The author of the letter, an apostle of Christ Jesus.

The verse establishes that what follows is God&#8217;s word to God&#8217;s people&#8212;calling them, and us, to listen and live accordingly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">I.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Timothy our brother.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Timothy the brother.</span> The word is used obviously in its wider sense as meaning a fellow-Christian. The opening words of the Epistle are nearly identical with those of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1Corinthians 1:1</a>. Timotheus, however, takes the place of Sosthenes, having apparently left Corinth before the arrival of the First Epistle, or, possibly, not having reached it. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) It is natural to think of him as acting in this instance, as in others where the Apostle joins his name with his own (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-1.htm" title=" Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,">Colossians 1:1</a>), as St. Paul's amanuensis.<p><span class= "bld">With all the saints.</span>--On the term "saints," see Note on <a href="/acts/9-13.htm" title="Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem:">Acts 9:13</a>. The term Achaia, which does not occur in the opening of 1 Cor., includes the whole of the Roman province, and was probably used to take in the disciples of Cenchreae (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>) as well as those of Corinth, and possibly also those of Athens. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the will of God</span> (see <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>). In the face of Judaizing opponents, it was essential that he should vindicate his independent apostolate (<a href="/acts/26-15.htm">Acts 26:15-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Timothy.</span> Timothy had been absent from St. Paul when he wrote the First Epistle, and Sosthenes had taken his place, whether as amanuensis or merely as a sort of joint authenticator. Our brother; literally, <span class="accented">the brother</span>, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>. The brotherhood applies both to St. Paul and to the Corinthians; there was a special bond of brotherhood between all members of "the household of faith." <span class="cmt_word">The saints</span>. Before the name "Christians" had come into general use, "saints" (<a href="/acts/9-13.htm">Acts 9:13</a>) and "brethren" were common designations or' those who were "faithful in Christ Jesus" (<a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In all Achaia.</span> In its classical sense Achaia means only the northern strip of the Peloponnesus; as a Roman province the name included both Hellas and the Peloponnesus. Hero St. Paul probably <span class="accented">uses</span> it in its narrower sense. The only <span class="accented">strictly</span> Achaian Church of which we know is Cenchrea, but doubtless there were little Christian communities along the coasts of the Corinthian gulf. To the Church at Athens St. Paul never directly alludes. This letter was not in any sense an encyclical letter; but even if it were not read in other communities, the Corinthians would convey to them the apostle's greeting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Paul,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#945;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Paulos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3972.htm">Strong's 3972: </a> </span><span class="str2">Paul, Paulus.
