In the context of his ministry, Paul often faced misunderstandings and accusations, yet he consistently demonstrated a deep pastoral concern for the churches he founded. This phrase highlights the selfless nature of Paul's ministry, reflecting the love of Christ, who also loved without reservation (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>). Paul's affection is a model of Christ-like love, which is sacrificial and unconditional.<p><b>but yours,</b><br>Here, Paul points out that the issue lies with the Corinthians' response to his ministry. The church in Corinth was known for its divisions and spiritual immaturity (<a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-4</a>). Their affection was limited, possibly due to their entanglement with worldly values and internal conflicts. This phrase challenges the Corinthians to examine their hearts and align their affections with the teachings of the Gospel. It serves as a call to spiritual maturity and unity, echoing the need for believers to love one another earnestly (<a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>).<p><b>that is restrained.</b><br>The restraint in the Corinthians' affection may have been due to their spiritual struggles and the influence of false apostles who questioned Paul's authority (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>). This phrase suggests a self-imposed limitation, where the Corinthians' hearts were not fully open to Paul or the message of the Gospel. It reflects a broader biblical theme of the heart's condition affecting one's relationship with God and others (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). The call here is for the Corinthians to remove any barriers to love and fellowship, reminiscent of the exhortation to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians.

His love stands wide-open, proven by sacrifice and transparent speech. The Corinthians, however, have allowed competing voices and lingering sin to tighten the walls of their hearts, stifling their affection for Paul and, ultimately, for Christ. Removing those restraints and opening wide to sincere, Christ-centered love is the only remedy&#8212;and the apostle urges them to take it without delay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Ye are not straitened in us.</span>--The word presents a natural contrast to the expansion, the dilatation, of heart of the previous verse.
