In biblical context, a veil often symbolizes a barrier to seeing or understanding spiritual truths. This imagery is reminiscent of the veil in the temple that separated the Holy of Holies, which was torn at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), symbolizing the removal of barriers between God and humanity. The idea of a veiled gospel also connects to <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</a>, where Paul discusses the veil over the hearts of those who do not turn to Christ. The gospel, or "good news," refers to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which can be obscured by spiritual blindness.<p><b>it is veiled to those who are perishing</b><br>"Those who are perishing" refers to individuals who are spiritually lost and on a path to eternal separation from God. This phrase highlights the dichotomy between those who are being saved and those who are not, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, where the message of the cross is described as foolishness to those who are perishing. The perishing are contrasted with believers who have received the light of the gospel. This spiritual blindness is often attributed to the influence of the "god of this age" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), who blinds the minds of unbelievers. The concept of perishing underscores the urgency of evangelism and the need for divine intervention to open the eyes of the spiritually blind.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and to defend his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of believers in the city of Corinth, known for its cultural and religious diversity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>The good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection, which Paul is proclaiming.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_are_perishing.htm">Those Who Are Perishing</a></b><br>Refers to individuals who are spiritually blind and unable to understand the gospel due to their unbelief.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/veil.htm">Veil</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Paul to describe the spiritual blindness that prevents some from seeing the truth of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_blindness.htm">Understanding Spiritual Blindness</a></b><br>Spiritual blindness is a condition that affects those who reject the gospel.

He has spoken of "manifestation of the truth," and yet has spoken of all Jews as unable to see it because they will not remove from their hearts the veil which hides it from them. How can "a veiled gospel" be a "manifested truth"? The answer is that the gospel is bright, but the eyes that should gaze on it are wilfully closed. Similarly in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>, he has compared the gospel to a fragrance of life, yet to the doomed captives - "to the perishing" - it comes "like a waft from the charnel house."
