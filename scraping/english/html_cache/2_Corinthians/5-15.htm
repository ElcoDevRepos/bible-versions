It reflects the core Christian belief that Jesus' atonement is available to all humanity, transcending ethnic, cultural, and social boundaries. This aligns with <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which speaks of God's love for the world. Theologically, it underscores the concept of substitutionary atonement, where Christ took upon Himself the sins of the world. Historically, this was a radical message in a time when religious systems were often exclusive.<p><b>that those who live</b><br>This refers to those who have accepted Christ's sacrifice and have been spiritually reborn. In the context of Paul's letters, "those who live" are believers who have experienced the transformative power of the Gospel. This new life is not merely physical but spiritual, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, which speaks of walking in newness of life. The phrase implies a shift from spiritual death to life through faith in Christ.<p><b>should no longer live for themselves</b><br>This phrase calls for a fundamental change in the believer's life purpose. It challenges the self-centered nature of humanity, urging believers to abandon selfish ambitions. In the cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its wealth and immorality, this was a countercultural message. It echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a> about denying oneself and taking up one's cross.<p><b>but for Him who died for them</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to living a life dedicated to Christ. This reflects the call to discipleship and service, as seen in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of being crucified with Christ and living by faith in Him. The phrase emphasizes gratitude and devotion, recognizing Christ's sacrifice as the foundation for a believer's life.<p><b>and was raised again</b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death. It provides hope and assurance of eternal life, as stated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>. The resurrection also serves as a type of firstfruits, guaranteeing the future resurrection of believers. This phrase reinforces the power and authority of Christ, who not only died but was also raised, validating His divinity and the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
