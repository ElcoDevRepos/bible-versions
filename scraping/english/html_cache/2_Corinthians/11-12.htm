This reflects his dedication to the gospel and his role as an apostle. His perseverance is reminiscent of other biblical figures who remained steadfast in their divine missions, such as Nehemiah rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/6-3.htm">Nehemiah 6:3</a>). Paul's determination is a model for believers to remain faithful in their calling, regardless of challenges.<p><b>in order to undercut those</b><br>Paul's intention is to expose and diminish the influence of false apostles. These individuals were attempting to undermine his authority and the true gospel message. The term "undercut" suggests a strategic move to weaken their position. This aligns with Paul's broader strategy of defending the truth, as seen in his other letters where he addresses false teachings (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>).<p><b>who want an opportunity</b><br>The false apostles were seeking a platform or occasion to elevate themselves and gain credibility among the Corinthian believers. This reflects a common issue in the early church where individuals sought personal gain or recognition, contrary to the selfless nature of true Christian leadership. This desire for opportunity is contrasted with Paul's self-sacrificial approach to ministry (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>).<p><b>to be regarded as our equals</b><br>These false teachers desired to be seen on the same level as Paul and his companions, who were genuine apostles. This reflects a deeper issue of pride and ambition, which is consistently warned against in scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The desire for equality in status, rather than in service or humility, reveals their misguided motives.<p><b>in the things of which they boast</b><br>The boasting of the false apostles likely centered around their credentials, spiritual experiences, or rhetorical skills. Paul frequently addresses the issue of boasting, emphasizing that true boasting should be in the Lord (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>). This phrase highlights the contrast between worldly boasting and the humility that should characterize Christian leaders. Paul's own "boasting" is always rooted in his weaknesses and the power of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

They boasted of their own disinterestedness. They taunted him with his meanness in taking money from the Macedonian churches. The Apostle wishes, therefore, by persisting in his line of conduct, in spite of the appeals of a real or affected jealousy, to place himself on the same level with them, them on the same level with himself. The comparison between them must rest, he says, on other grounds. This seems the only tenable and coherent interpretation; nor is there any force in the objection which has been urged against it, that there is no evidence that the rival teachers did teach gratuitously. If this is a natural inference from St. Paul's language, and there is no evidence to the contrary, that is surely evidence enough. It may be added, however, that there is at least in favour of the interpretation here given, the evidence of antecedent probability. It was likely that those who claimed to be in some special sense followers of Christ, would at least affect to act on the words of Christ, "Freely ye have received, freely give." (See Note on <a href="/matthew/10-8.htm" title="Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.">Matthew 10:8</a>.) It was likely that those who, from another point of view, were representatives of the scribes of Judaism, should at least affect to act as the noblest of those scribes had acted, and to teach, not for payment, but for the love of teaching.
