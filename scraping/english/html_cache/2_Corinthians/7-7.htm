Titus's arrival was significant because it brought news from the Corinthian church, which was a source of comfort to Paul. In the context of the early church, personal visits were crucial for communication and relationship-building, as letters could take a long time to be delivered. Titus's presence was a tangible sign of the connection between Paul and the Corinthians.<p><b>but also by the comfort he had received from you</b><br>The Corinthians had provided comfort to Titus, which in turn comforted Paul. This reflects the mutual support and encouragement that characterized the early Christian communities. The comfort given to Titus likely included hospitality and a positive reception, which was important in a time when travel was arduous and often dangerous. This mutual comfort is a practical outworking of the love and unity that Paul often emphasizes in his letters.<p><b>He told us about your longing</b><br>Titus reported to Paul the Corinthians' longing, which indicates their desire to be reconciled with Paul and to maintain a strong relationship with him. This longing can be seen as a response to Paul's previous letter, which was written with a heavy heart to address issues within the church. The Corinthians' longing reflects their repentance and desire to align with Paul's teachings.<p><b>your mourning</b><br>The mourning mentioned here likely refers to the Corinthians' sorrow over their previous behavior and the divisions within their church. This mourning is a sign of genuine repentance, which is a key theme in Paul's letters. It aligns with the biblical principle that godly sorrow leads to repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>), contrasting with worldly sorrow that leads to death.<p><b>and your zeal for me</b><br>The Corinthians' zeal for Paul indicates their renewed commitment to his apostolic authority and teachings. This zeal is a positive response to Paul's earlier rebukes and corrections. In the broader biblical context, zeal is often associated with fervent devotion and enthusiasm for God's work, as seen in the zeal of Jesus for His Father's house (<a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>).<p><b>so that I rejoiced all the more</b><br>Paul's joy is a result of the Corinthians' positive response and transformation. This joy is not just personal satisfaction but is deeply rooted in the spiritual well-being of the Corinthian church. Paul's rejoicing is consistent with his pastoral heart and his desire for the churches to grow in faith and unity. This joy also reflects the biblical principle that there is great joy in heaven over one sinner who repents (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, expressing his joy and relief upon hearing about the Corinthians' response.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A fellow worker and messenger of Paul who brought news of the Corinthians' repentance and longing for Paul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthians.htm">Corinthians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a church community in Corinth that had previously been in conflict with Paul but had shown signs of repentance and reconciliation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>The region where Paul was when he received the encouraging report from Titus about the Corinthians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_comfort.htm">The Comfort</a></b><br>The emotional and spiritual relief Paul experienced upon hearing of the Corinthians' positive response and change of heart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_reconciliation.htm">The Power of Reconciliation</a></b><br>The Corinthians' change of heart and reconciliation with Paul highlights the transformative power of repentance and forgiveness in Christian relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_encouragement.htm">The Role of Encouragement</a></b><br>Titus' report brought immense comfort to Paul, demonstrating the importance of sharing good news and encouragement within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/longing_and_zeal_for_spiritual_leaders.htm">Longing and Zeal for Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>The Corinthians' longing and zeal for Paul serve as a model for how believers should honor and support their spiritual leaders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_spiritual_growth.htm">The Joy of Spiritual Growth</a></b><br>Paul's joy upon hearing of the Corinthians' spiritual progress underscores the deep satisfaction that comes from witnessing others grow in their faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_godly_sorrow.htm">The Importance of Godly Sorrow</a></b><br>The Corinthians' mourning over their previous actions reflects a godly sorrow that leads to repentance, as discussed later in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_7_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 7:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Titus_comfort_impact_on_your_interactions.htm">How does Titus' comfort in 2 Corinthians 7:7 inspire your interactions with others?

Their longing, mourning, and zeal confirmed that God&#8217;s Word had done its work, turning discipline into deeper fellowship. The verse reminds believers today that humble response to correction not only heals relationships but also multiplies comfort and joy throughout the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And not by his coming only.</span>--There was joy, doubtless, in seeing his true son in the faith (<a href="/titus/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;">Titus 1:1</a>) once again, but the great comfort was found in the news which he brought with him. On the part of the majority, at least, of those who had been present when the Epistle was read, there had been all the feelings which he most desired to rouse--longing to see him as he longed to see them (see <a href="/romans/1-11.htm" title="For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established;">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="But now when Timotheus came from you to us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that you have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:">1Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>, for the meaning of the word), their "mourning" (<span class= "ital">uttered lamentation</span>) for having grieved him; their <span class= "ital">zeal</span> (not "towards" him, but) <span class= "ital">on his behalf and for him,</span> as against those who slandered him. All these were elements of comfort, and his sorrow was turned into a yet greater joy than had been caused by the mere arrival of Titus.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not by his coming only.</span> The mere fact of Titus's arrival cheered St. Paul, because Titus seems to have been of a strong and cheery temperament. St. Paul, partly because of his infirmities, was peculiarly dependent on the support of human sympathy (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1-8</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-4.htm">2 Timothy 4:4</a>; <a href="/acts/17-15.htm">Acts 17:15</a>; <a href="/acts/28-15.htm">Acts 28:15</a>). It was not, however, the mere arrival of Titus which cheered him, but still more the good news which he brought, and which partially lightened his anxieties. In all probability this letter was written almost immediately after the arrival of Titus, and while the joy caused by his presence was still glowing in the apostle's heart. It is characteristic of the seclusion of an austere life that St. Jerome supposes the cause of the apostle's distress to have been that Titus was his interpreter, and that in his absence he could not preach! <span class="cmt_word">Your earnest desire.</span> Your yearning to see me once more.
