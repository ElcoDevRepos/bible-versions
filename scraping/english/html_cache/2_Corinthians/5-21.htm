Jesus is depicted as the perfect, spotless Lamb of God, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of the Messiah having "done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth." The sinlessness of Christ is crucial for His role as the perfect sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>, which states that He was "tempted in every way, just as we are&#8212;yet He did not sin." This sinlessness sets Jesus apart from all humanity, who are inherently sinful, and qualifies Him uniquely to bear the sins of the world.<p><b>to be sin on our behalf</b><br>This phrase indicates the substitutionary atonement of Christ, a core doctrine where Jesus takes upon Himself the sins of humanity. The concept of substitution is deeply rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where animals were offered to atone for the sins of the people (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21-22</a>). In becoming sin, Jesus fulfills the role of the ultimate sacrifice, as foreshadowed by the scapegoat and the Passover lamb. This act of becoming sin does not mean Jesus became sinful; rather, He bore the penalty and consequences of sin, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, which states, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us."<p><b>so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God</b><br>This phrase highlights the doctrine of imputed righteousness, where believers are declared righteous through faith in Christ. This righteousness is not earned by human effort but is a gift from God, as described in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe." The concept of being "in Him" signifies a union with Christ, where His righteousness is credited to believers, allowing them to stand justified before God. This transformation is part of the new covenant promise, where God writes His laws on the hearts of His people (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), and is a fulfillment of the promise of a new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who orchestrates the plan of salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The sinless Son of God who became sin for humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, explaining the profound truth of substitutionary atonement.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter resided, known for its diverse culture and moral challenges.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The event where Jesus took upon Himself the sins of the world, central to the message of this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_exchange.htm">The Great Exchange</a></b><br>Jesus, who was sinless, took on our sin so that we might receive His righteousness.

The Greek order of the words is more emphatic: <span class= "ital">Him that knew no sin He made sin for us.</span> The words are, in the first instance, an assertion of the absolute sinlessness of Christ. All other men had an experience of its power, gained by yielding to it. He alone gained this experience by resisting it, and yet suffering its effects. None could "convict Him of sin" (<a href="/john/8-46.htm" title="Which of you convinces me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do you not believe me?">John 8:46</a>). The "Prince of this world had nothing in Him" (<a href="/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>). (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1Peter 2:22</a>.) And then there comes what we may call the paradox of redemption. He, God, made the sinless One to be "sin." The word cannot mean, as has been said sometimes, a "sin offering." That meaning is foreign to the New Testament, and it is questionable whether it is found in the Old, <a href="/leviticus/5-9.htm" title="And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.">Leviticus 5:9</a> being the nearest approach to it. The train of thought is that God dealt with Christ, not as though He were a sinner, like other men, but as though He were sin itself, absolutely identified with it. So, in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>, he speaks of Christ as made "a curse for us," and in <a href="/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a> as "being made in the likeness of sinful flesh." We have here, it is obvious, the germ of a mysterious thought, out of which forensic theories of the atonement, of various types, might be and have been developed. It is characteristic of St. Paul that he does not so develop it. Christ identified with man's sin: mankind identified with Christ's righteousness--that is the truth, simple and yet unfathomable, in which he is content to rest. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath made him to be sin for us;</span> rather, he made; he speaks with definite reference to the cross. The expression is closely analogous to that in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where it is said that Christ has been "made <span class="accented">a curse</span> for us." He was, as St. Augustine says, "delictorum susceptor, non commissor." He knew no sin; nay, he was the very righteousness, holiness itself (<a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), and yet, for our benefit, God made him to be "sin" for us, in that he "sent him in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin" (<a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>). Many have understood the word "sin" in the sense of sin offering (<a href="/leviticus/5-9.htm">Leviticus 5:9</a>, LXX.); but that is a precarious application of the word, which is not justified by any other passage in the New Testament. We cannot, as Dean Plumptre says, get beyond the simple statement, which St. Paul is content to leave in its unexplicable mystery, "Christ identified with man's sin; man identified with Christ's righteousness." And thus, in Christ, God becomes Jehovah-Tsidkenu, "the Lord our Righteousness" (<a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might be made the righteousness of God in him;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that we might become</span>. The best comment on the pregnant significance of this verse is <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16, 17</a>, which is developed and explained in so large a section of that great Epistle (see 3:22-25; 4:5-8; 5:19, etc.). <span class="accented">In him</span> In his blood is a means of propitiation by which the righteousness of God becomes the righteousness of man (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>), so that man is justified. The truth which St. Paul thus develops and expresses is stated by St. Peter and St. John in a simpler and less theological form (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22-24</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[God] made</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#959;&#943;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epoi&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
