This phrase suggests a situation of extreme peril, possibly life-threatening persecution or illness. The "sentence of death" indicates a sense of hopelessness and inevitability, akin to a judicial sentence. This experience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who faced dire circumstances, such as David fleeing from Saul or Daniel in the lion's den. It highlights the reality of suffering in the Christian life and the apostolic ministry, aligning with Jesus' teachings on persecution (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>).<p><b>in order that we would not trust in ourselves</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose behind the trial: to shift reliance from human strength to divine power. It reflects a common biblical theme where human weakness is a conduit for divine strength, as seen in Gideon's victory with a reduced army (Judges 7) and Paul's own "thorn in the flesh" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</a>). The cultural context of the Greco-Roman world often emphasized self-reliance and personal honor, making this a countercultural message for Paul's audience.<p><b>but in God, who raises the dead</b><br>Here, Paul emphasizes the ultimate power of God, contrasting human frailty with divine omnipotence. The reference to God "who raises the dead" is a direct allusion to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the cornerstone of Christian faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-22</a>). This phrase not only reassures believers of God's power over life and death but also connects to the hope of the resurrection for all believers. It echoes Old Testament instances of God's life-giving power, such as the raising of the widow's son by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>) and foreshadows the future resurrection of the dead at Christ's return (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, who is writing to the church in Corinth about his experiences and the lessons learned through suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who is depicted as the one who raises the dead and in whom believers should place their trust.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/suffering_and_persecution.htm">Suffering and Persecution</a></b><br>The context of Paul's writing, as he and his companions faced severe trials that led them to rely on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection.htm">Resurrection</a></b><br>The power of God highlighted in this verse, emphasizing His ability to bring life from death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Our trials and sufferings are opportunities to shift our trust from ourselves to God.<br><br>Recognize that self-reliance can be a barrier to experiencing God's power in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_resurrection.htm">The Power of Resurrection</a></b><br>God's ability to raise the dead is a reminder of His ultimate power and authority.<br><br>This power is available to us, offering hope and assurance in the face of life's challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_in_suffering.htm">Purpose in Suffering</a></b><br>Suffering can serve a divine purpose, teaching us to rely on God.<br><br>Embrace trials as a means to deepen your faith and trust in God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Trusting in God should lead to practical steps of faith in our daily lives.<br><br>Evaluate areas where you may be relying on your own strength and seek to surrender them to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_1_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 1:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_1_9_on_God_vs_self-reliance.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 1:9 teach reliance on God over self-reliance?

Literally, it means <span class= "ital">answer,</span> and was probably a half-technical term, used in medical practice, which St. Paul may have adopted from St. Luke, expressing the "opinion" which a physician formed on his diagnosis of a case submitted to him. The Apostle had found himself in a state in which, so far as he could judge for himself, that opinion would have been against the prospect of recovery. He ceased to trust in himself, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in any remedial measures that he could take for himself. He could only fold his hands and trust in God. Recovery in such a case was a veritable resurrection. It may be noted, however, that a cognate word (<span class= "ital">apokrisis</span>) is frequently used by Hippocrates in the sense of a morbid or virulent secretion, and possibly the word here used may also have had that meaning. In this case, what he says would be equivalent to "We had the symptoms of a fatal disease in us."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; perhaps rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>.
