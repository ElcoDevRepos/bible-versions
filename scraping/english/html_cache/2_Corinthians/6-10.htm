Paul, the author of 2 Corinthians, often faced persecution, hardship, and emotional distress (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>). Despite these trials, he maintained a spirit of joy, rooted in his faith in Christ and the hope of eternal life (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). This joy is not dependent on external circumstances but is a fruit of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>). The concept of joy amidst suffering is also seen in the life of Jesus, who endured the cross "for the joy set before Him" (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><b>poor, yet making many rich;</b><br>Paul frequently experienced material poverty, as he often relied on the support of others for his ministry (<a href="/philippians/4-12.htm">Philippians 4:12</a>). However, his spiritual wealth was immense, as he shared the gospel, which offers the riches of God's grace and eternal life (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7-8</a>). This reflects the teachings of Jesus, who, though rich, became poor for our sake, so that through His poverty, we might become rich (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>). The richness Paul refers to is not material but spiritual, offering believers the inheritance of God's kingdom (<a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>).<p><b>having nothing, and yet possessing everything.</b><br>Paul's statement here highlights the Christian's ultimate security and sufficiency in Christ. Though he may lack worldly possessions, he possesses everything of true value through his relationship with God (<a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). This echoes Jesus' teaching that treasures in heaven are of far greater worth than earthly wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The apostle's contentment and sense of possession stem from his identity in Christ, who provides all that is needed for life and godliness (<a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>).

Did men say of him, as others had said of the saints of God before him, that he was "smitten of God, and afflicted"? Was it with him, as with David, that when he wept, that "was turned to his reproof"? that when he "made sackcloth his garment" he "became a proverb unto them"? (<a href="/context/psalms/69-10.htm" title="When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.">Psalm 69:10-11</a>.) This seems, on the whole, the most probable explanation of the words. His Jewish rivals, or the jesters of Corinth, taunted him with his want of cheerfulness, "He was always in trouble." This, at least, enables us to understand the bitterness of spirit in which St. Paul spoke, and to enter into the full force of his answer: "Yea, but with our sorrow there is also the ever-flowing well-spring of joy--a joy not of the world, but of the Holy Ghost."<p><span class= "bld">As poor, yet making many rich.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">as a beggar.</span> It is not hard to imagine that the outward circumstances of St. Paul's life, his daily toil as a tent-maker, his accepting gifts from the Church of Philippi (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-8.htm" title="I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.">2Corinthians 11:8-9</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15</a>), would furnish occasion for some taunting jest. We seem to hear men speaking of him as a "beggar," a "mendicant." "Yes," he answers, "but I am able to make many rich." It is a possible, though perhaps not altogether an adequate, explanation of the words to see in them a reference to the fact that out of his "poverty" he was able to supply the necessities of others (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm" title="I have showed you all things, how that so laboring you ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.">Acts 20:35</a>). We must, at all events, think of his words as including something more than this, and reminding the Corinthians that he had made many rich with the unsearchable riches of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</span>--The series of paradoxes culminates in this. In language which has found echoes in the thoughts of sages, saints, mystics, he utters the truth that in the absolute surrender of the thought of calling anything its own the soul becomes the heir of the universe. All things are his, as with the certainty of an assured inheritance. The beatitude of the meek, of those who claim nothing, is that they "shall inherit the earth," and so all things are theirs--the forces of nature, and the changes and chances of life--for all are working together for their good. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm" title="Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.">Matthew 5:5</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing</span>. The early Christians always insist on "joy" as one of the fruits of the Spirit (comp. <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>), and especially joy in the midst of grief and anguish (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>; <a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>, "Rejoice always"). The best proof that this was no mere phraseology, but an amazing and new <span class="accented">charism</span> granted to the world, may be seen in the Epistle to the Philippians. It was written when St. Paul was old, poor, deserted, imprisoned, in danger of immediate death. and apparently in the lowest deeps of forsakes sorrow; vet the spontaneous keynote of the whole Epistle is, "I rejoice; rejoice ye" (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As poor.</span> The word means even "<span class="accented">paupers</span>," and describes a very literal fact.
