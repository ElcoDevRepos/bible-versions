The context suggests a disciplinary issue, possibly related to the man mentioned in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a> who was involved in immorality. The grief caused is not just personal but affects the entire community, highlighting the interconnectedness of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p><b>he has not grieved me</b><br>Paul emphasizes that the offense is not primarily against him, even though he is an apostle and spiritual leader. This reflects a Christ-like attitude, as seen in Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and reconciliation (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). It underscores the principle that sin within the church is a communal concern, not just a personal affront.<p><b>but all of you</b><br>The grief extends to the whole church, indicating the corporate nature of sin and its consequences. This aligns with the biblical understanding that the church is one body, and when one member suffers, all suffer (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>). It also reflects the communal responsibility to address sin and maintain purity within the church (<a href="/galatians/6.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><b>to some degree</b><br>Paul acknowledges the extent of the grief without exaggerating it. This balanced approach is important in church discipline, ensuring that responses are measured and appropriate. It reflects wisdom in leadership, avoiding both minimization and overreaction, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>.<p><b>not to overstate it</b><br>Paul is careful not to amplify the situation beyond its reality, which could lead to unnecessary division or harshness. This restraint is consistent with biblical teachings on truthfulness and love (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>). It also serves as a model for handling conflict within the church, emphasizing restoration over punishment (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth dealing with internal conflicts and issues of discipline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offender.htm">The Offender</a></b><br>An unnamed individual within the Corinthian church who caused grief, likely through sin or divisive behavior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community.htm">The Community</a></b><br>The broader body of believers in Corinth who were affected by the actions of the offender.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_grief.htm">The Event of Grief</a></b><br>The specific incident or behavior that caused distress within the church community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin_on_the_community.htm">The Impact of Sin on the Community</a></b><br>Sin does not only affect the individual but also the entire community.

He will not name him. He is, as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1Corinthians 5:1-5</a>, and here in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2Corinthians 2:7</a>, "a man," "such a one." The abrupt introduction of the qualifying clause, "but in part," and the absence of any authoritative punctuation, makes the construction ambiguous. It admits of three possible explanations: (1) "If any have caused grief, it is not <span class= "ital">I</span> alone whom he hath grieved, but in part, to some extent--not to press the charge against <span class= "ital">him</span> too heavily--all of <span class= "ital">you"</span> They, the members of the Corinthian Church, were really the greatest sufferers from the scandal which brought shame upon it. (2) "If any have caused grief, h<span class= "ital">e</span> hath not grieved me, save in part" (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he is not the only offender), "that I may not press the charge against <span class= "ital">all of you</span>--so that I may not treat you as if you were all open to the same condemnation, or had all caused the same sorrow." (3) Combining parts of (1) and (2): "It is not <span class= "ital">I</span> whom he hath grieved, save in part, that I may not lay the blame on all of <span class= "ital">you."</span> Of these (1) seems the simplest and most natural. In any case, it is important to remember that the position of the pronoun in the Greek, "<span class= "ital">me</span> he hath not grieved," makes it specially emphatic.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-11.</span> <span class="accented">- The results of his letter in their treatment of the incestuous offender</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if any have caused grief.</span> The word "pain" or "grief" which has been so prominent in the last verses, naturally reminds St. Paul of the person whose misdoings had caused all this trouble. The "any" is in the singular. <span class="cmt_word">He hath not grieved me, but in part,</span> etc. Of the various ways of taking this verse, the most tenable seems to be this: "If any one has caused pain, he has not pained <span class="accented">me</span> but partly (not to weigh down too heavily) <span class="accented">all</span> of you. St. Paul is denying that the feelings with which he hat(written his severe letter were due to mere personal sorrow or indignation. In writing he felt for the wrong done to <span class="accented">them</span>, to the whole Corinthian Church, at least as much as for the smart of his own grief and disappointment. The word "partly" is introduced, as St. Chrysostom says, to soften the expression, "he has grieved <span class="accented">you all</span>." It will then mean "to a certain extent." The words, "that I may not overcharge," or rather, as in the Revised Version, "that I press not too heavily," assign the reason for the modifying clause, "in part." When St. Paul says that this man's conduct had <span class="accented">even</span> to <span class="accented">any extent</span> grieved the whole community, his words may seem to conflict with <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; but he is thinking, not of the immediate condonation of the offender there alluded to, but of the agony of subsequent repentance which his letter had awoke in the whole (or practically the whole) community (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>). The phrase, "that I press not too heavily," refers then to the offender: "I will not say outright that he has grieved not <span class="accented">me, but all of you</span>, because I do not wish to bear too hard on him" (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), "but I will say that he has grieved you and me alike to some extent." The phrase, "in part," occurs also in <a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
