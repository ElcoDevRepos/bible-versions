By referring to himself in the third person, Paul emphasizes that the focus should be on Christ rather than on personal achievements or experiences. The term "in Christ" signifies a deep spiritual union with Jesus, a common theme in Paul's writings, highlighting the transformative power of faith and the believer's new identity.<p><b>who fourteen years ago</b><br>The mention of "fourteen years ago" provides a chronological marker, suggesting that this experience occurred around 42-44 AD, during Paul's early ministry. This timeframe aligns with his time in Tarsus or Antioch, before his first missionary journey. It underscores the long-lasting impact of the vision on Paul's life and ministry, even though he had not spoken of it until now.<p><b>was caught up to the third heaven</b><br>The "third heaven" is understood in Jewish cosmology as the dwelling place of God, beyond the sky (first heaven) and outer space (second heaven). This reflects a belief in a multi-layered universe, common in ancient thought. Being "caught up" suggests a divine action, indicating that this was a supernatural experience, not initiated by Paul himself. This aligns with other biblical accounts of heavenly visions, such as those of Isaiah and John in Revelation.<p><b>Whether it was in the body or out of it I do not know, but God knows</b><br>Paul's uncertainty about the nature of his experience&#8212;whether physical or purely spiritual&#8212;highlights the mystery and transcendence of divine encounters. This reflects a broader biblical theme where human understanding is limited in the face of God's majesty. The phrase "but God knows" emphasizes God's omniscience and the trust believers place in His understanding, even when human comprehension falls short. This echoes other scriptural affirmations of God's superior knowledge, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, who is speaking about a personal experience or vision, possibly referring to himself in the third person.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_in_christ.htm">The Man in Christ</a></b><br>Likely Paul himself, who had a profound spiritual experience of being caught up to the "third heaven."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_heaven.htm">The Third Heaven</a></b><br>In Jewish cosmology, this refers to the highest heaven, the dwelling place of God, beyond the sky (first heaven) and outer space (second heaven).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fourteen_years_ago.htm">Fourteen Years Ago</a></b><br>This time reference suggests that the event occurred before Paul wrote this letter, indicating a significant spiritual experience that he had kept private for many years.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate knower of all things, including the nature of Paul's experience, whether it was physical or spiritual.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_spiritual_experiences.htm">Humility in Spiritual Experiences</a></b><br>Paul demonstrates humility by not boasting about his spiritual experiences, reminding us to focus on God's grace rather than personal achievements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_of_god's_revelation.htm">The Mystery of God's Revelation</a></b><br>Spiritual experiences can be mysterious and beyond human understanding, emphasizing the need to trust in God's wisdom and knowledge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_the_spiritual_realm.htm">The Reality of the Spiritual Realm</a></b><br>Paul's experience affirms the existence of a spiritual realm and encourages believers to live with an eternal perspective.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God chooses how and when to reveal Himself, reminding us to be open to His timing and methods.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_weakness.htm">Encouragement in Weakness</a></b><br>Paul's later discussion of his "thorn in the flesh" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</a>) teaches that God's power is made perfect in our weakness, encouraging reliance on His strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_12_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 12:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_12_2_s_relevance_to_modern_visions.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 12:2 illustrate the concept of spiritual visions today?

By speaking anonymously, dating the event, describing a literal rapture to the highest heaven, and admitting what he could not grasp, he magnifies the Lord rather than himself.

It is all but impossible to connect the facts that follow with any definite point of time in the Apostle's life as recorded in the Acts. The date of the Epistle may be fixed, without much risk of error, in A.D. 57. Reckoning fourteen years back, we come to A.D. 43, which coincides with the period of unrecorded activity between St. Paul's departure from Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>) and his arrival at Antioch (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>). It would be giving, perhaps, too wide a margin to the words "more than fourteen years ago" to refer the visions and revelations of which he here speaks to those given him at the time of his conversion, in A.D. 37. The trance in the Temple (<a href="/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>) on his first visit to Jerusalem may, perhaps, be identified with them; but it seems best, on the whole, to refer them to the commencement of his work at Antioch, when they would have been unspeakably precious, as an encouragement in his arduous work. It may be noted that <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a> specifically refers to one revelation at Antioch, and it may well have been preceded by others. The term "a man in Christ," as a way of speaking of himself, is probably connected with the thought that "if any man be in Christ he is a new creature" (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>). As one who lived and moved and had his being in Christ, he was raised to a higher region of experience than that in which he had lived before. It was in moments such as he describes that he became conscious of that "new creation" with a new and hitherto unknown experience. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I knew;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I know</span>. <span class="cmt_word">A man.</span> St. Paul speaks in this indirect way of himself (see vers. 5, 7). <span class="cmt_word">In Christ</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). To St. Paul every true Christian was a man whose personal life was lost in the life of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Above fourteen years ago.</span> The note of time is very vague. If we are <span class="accented">at all</span> able to identify the vision alluded to, it must have been the vision in the temple, referred to in <a href="/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>, which was, roughly speaking, "about fourteen years" before this time. The vision on the road to Damascus had occurred about twenty years earlier than the date of this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Whether in the body,</span> etc. A powerful description of the absorption of all conscious <span class="accented">bodily</span> modes of apprehension. In their comments on. these verses, many commentators enter into speculations which seem to me to be so entirely arbitrary and futile that I shall not even allude to them. St. Paul's bodily and mental state during this vision is familiar to all who know the history of Oriental and mediaeval mysticism. <span class="cmt_word">Caught up</span> (<a href="/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>; <a href="/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the third heaven.</span> It is most unlikely that St. Paul is here in any way referring to the Jewish <span class="accented">hagadoth</span> about seven heavens. The expression is purely general, and even the rabbis did not expect to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre</span>. Hence all speculations about first, second, and third heavens are idle and useless. Even as late as the Clementine writings in the middle of the second century, an attempt is made, in reference to this passage, to disparage St. Paul by sneering at visions as a medium of revelation, on the ground that they may spring from self-deception; and this rapture of the "bald hook-nosed Galilean" to the third heaven is also sneered at in the 'Philopatris' of the pseudo-Lucian. Yet how modest and simple is St. Paul's awestruck reference to this event, when compared, not only with the lying details of Mohammed's visit to heaven, but even with the visions of St. Theresa or Swedenborg! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7990;&#948;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
