This reflects his pastoral heart and responsibility as an apostle. The Corinthian church had a history of moral and doctrinal issues, as seen in 1 Corinthians, where Paul addressed divisions, immorality, and misuse of spiritual gifts. His fear indicates a deep desire for their growth and repentance, aligning with his previous exhortations for unity and holiness.<p><b>and you may not find me as you wish</b><br>Paul anticipates that the Corinthians might not find him as they desire if they continue in sin. This suggests a potential for disciplinary action, as Paul had previously warned them in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a> about coming with a rod of discipline if necessary. His apostolic authority was sometimes questioned, and he needed to assert it for the sake of their spiritual well-being.<p><b>I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, rage, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder</b><br>These specific sins reflect the social and relational issues prevalent in the Corinthian church. Quarreling and jealousy were evident in their divisions (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11-12</a>). Rage and rivalry could stem from their competitive nature, possibly influenced by the Greek culture's emphasis on rhetoric and status. Slander and gossip undermine community trust and reflect a lack of love, contrary to the love described in <a href="/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>. Arrogance was a recurring issue, as some Corinthians boasted in their knowledge and spiritual gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). Disorder indicates a lack of peace and structure, which Paul addressed in their worship practices (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). These behaviors contrast with the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and the unity Christ prayed for in <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, expressing his concerns about the Corinthian church's behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth struggling with internal conflicts and moral issues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_visit.htm">Paul's Visit</a></b><br>The anticipated event where Paul plans to visit the Corinthian church, hoping to find them in a state of spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_division.htm">Guard Against Division</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s fear of finding quarreling and rivalries serves as a warning to guard against division within the church. Unity in Christ should be prioritized over personal differences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivate_humility.htm">Cultivate Humility</a></b><br>Arrogance and disorder are often rooted in pride. Christians are called to cultivate humility, recognizing that all are equal before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promote_peace_and_reconciliation.htm">Promote Peace and Reconciliation</a></b><br>The presence of slander and gossip indicates a breakdown in relationships.

It will be worth while to attempt to fix the exact significance of each word somewhat more accurately than is done in the Authorised version. "Debates," rather <span class= "ital">strifes</span> or <span class= "ital">quarrels,</span> had in older English a darker shade of meaning than it has now. Men spoke of a "deadly <span class= "ital">debate"</span> between friends. Chapman's <span class= "ital">Homer</span> makes Achilles complain that he has cast his life into "<span class= "ital">debates</span> past end" (<span class= "ital">Iliad,</span> ii. 331). "Envyings" better <span class= "ital">jealousies,</span> another Greek word being appropriated for "envy" in the strict sense. The word, like "jealousy," is capable of a good sense, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge!

It is well, perhaps, to notice how closely allied are the qualities which the word expresses, how soon "zeal" (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge!

"Wrath." The passion so described is treated by great ethical writers (Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Eth. Nicom.</span> iii. 8) as almost inseparable from true courage. In <span class= "ital">the</span> New Testament it is always used either of human wrath in its evil aspects (<a href="/luke/4-28.htm" title="And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,">Luke 4:28</a>; <a href="/acts/19-28.htm" title="And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-27.htm" title="By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.">Hebrews 11:27</a>), or--but only in the Apocalypse, where it occurs in this sense frequently--of the wrath of God (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm" title="The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:">Revelation 14:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-19.htm" title="And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.">Revelation 14:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm" title="And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.">Revelation 15:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-1.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God on the earth.">Revelation 16:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>).
