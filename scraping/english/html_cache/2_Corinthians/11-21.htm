In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the criticisms and comparisons made by the so-called "super-apostles" who boasted of their credentials and achievements. Paul&#8217;s admission of "weakness" is a rhetorical device to highlight the true nature of Christian strength, which is found in humility and reliance on God (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). This phrase also reflects the cultural context of honor and shame in Greco-Roman society, where strength and power were highly valued. Paul turns this cultural expectation on its head by embracing what the world sees as weakness.<p><b>Speaking as a fool, however,</b><br>Paul uses the term "fool" to describe his boasting, which he considers foolishness. This is a deliberate contrast to the wisdom of the world, which values self-promotion and pride. In <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>, Paul discusses the foolishness of the cross, which is the power of God. By speaking as a fool, Paul aligns himself with the wisdom of God rather than the wisdom of the world. This also connects to the biblical theme of God using the weak and foolish things of the world to shame the wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>I can match what anyone else dares to boast about.</b><br>Here, Paul asserts that he can match the boasts of the "super-apostles" if he chooses to engage in such folly. This statement is not an endorsement of boasting but rather a critique of the false apostles who rely on human credentials and achievements. Paul&#8217;s true boast is in his sufferings for Christ and his weaknesses, which demonstrate the power of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-30</a>). This reflects the biblical principle that true strength and authority come from God, not human accomplishments. Paul&#8217;s life and ministry serve as a type of Christ, who, though He was in the form of God, took on the form of a servant and humbled Himself (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, defending his apostleship and contrasting his ministry with that of false apostles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

Earlier he had written, &#8220;Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-29.htm">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>). Here he feels ashamed because he must now talk about himself rather than point solely to Christ (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>). The apostle&#8217;s humility is genuine; self-promotion runs counter to his calling (<a href="/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I concede that we were too weak for that!</b><p>The &#8220;weakness&#8221; Paul concedes is ironic. Some Corinthians had mistaken his gentleness and refusal to exact payment for ministry as weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1, 10</a>; 11:7&#8211;9). Paul turns that insult on its head: if refusing to exploit them is weakness, he gladly owns it (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). In truth, this &#8220;weakness&#8221; showcases Christ&#8217;s power, echoing the Lord&#8217;s pattern of strength through seeming frailty (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; By working with his own hands (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>) and declining financial support in Corinth, Paul mirrored Jesus, &#8220;who came not to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>&#8226; He contrasts himself with &#8220;super-apostles&#8221; who boasted of authority while burdening the church (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>). Paul&#8217;s restraint exposes their exploitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Speaking as a fool</b><p>Paul dislikes the entire exercise of boasting and labels it &#8220;folly&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>). Yet, compelled by the Corinthians&#8217; fascination with flashy credentials, he momentarily adopts the foolish method to make a point. His disclaimer (&#8220;speaking as a fool&#8221;) signals that boasting is contrary to godly wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>). Still, he proceeds so the church can see that even on worldly terms he is not inferior to his rivals (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I can match what anyone else dares to boast about</b><p>Having surrendered to their forced comparison game, Paul asserts he can match&#8212;indeed surpass&#8212;any competitor&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233;:<p>&#8226; Jewish pedigree and covenantal heritage (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-22.htm">2 Corinthians 11:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Missionary labors: far more imprisonments, beatings, dangers (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Visions and revelations (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Authentic apostolic signs and wonders (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>).<p>Yet every boast ultimately turns to Christ&#8217;s grace: &#8220;Let him who boasts boast in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>). Paul&#8217;s catalog of hardships underscores not his greatness, but God&#8217;s sustaining power (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/2_corinthians/11-21.htm">2 Corinthians 11:21</a> Paul reluctantly adopts the language of his opposers. He admits, with shame, that his gentle approach looked &#8220;weak,&#8221; yet that very &#8220;weakness&#8221; aligns him with Christ&#8217;s servant-heart. Calling the exercise foolish, he shows he can equal or surpass any rival&#8217;s claims, but only to redirect attention to the Lord who empowers true ministry. The verse therefore reveals Paul&#8217;s pastoral humility, exposes false teachers, and highlights the paradoxical strength God displays through apparent weakness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I speak it as a matter of reproach to myself, as though we were weak.</span> The irony becomes more intense than ever. He has named these acts of outrage, he says, as though by way of self-disparagement. "<span class= "ital">We</span>" (the pronoun is strongly emphasised) "were too infirm to venture on such things." The taunt flung at his bodily infirmities is still present to his thoughts, and he assumes, in the bitterness of his irony, that it was through them he had been kept from like acts of self-asserting authority. Then he resumes his contrast, still dwelling on the offensive words, "folly" or "insanity," which had been used of him: "Yes, but on every ground of daring--I know you will see my insanity again in this--I have as much right to dare as they."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I steak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.</span> The sense is uncertain, but if with the Revised Version we render it, "I speak by way of disparagement," the verse may be understood as an ironical admission that, if absence from these violent and self-assertive proceedings be a sign of weakness, he has been weak. He proceeds to correct the ironical admission in the next clause. The meaning can hardly be, "I admit the disgraces I have suffered" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/6-8.htm">2 Corinthians 6:8</a>), because he is speaking of the Corinthians, not of himself. I am bold also.
