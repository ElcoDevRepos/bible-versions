The Apostle Paul often uses Old Testament references to validate his teachings and connect the new covenant with the promises made to Israel. This approach underscores the continuity of God's plan throughout history.<p><b>&#8220;In the time of favor I heard you,</b><br>The "time of favor" refers to a period when God extends His grace and mercy. In Isaiah, this was a promise to the exiled Israelites, assuring them of God's future restoration. Paul applies this to the present age, indicating that the time of God's grace is now available through Christ. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecy and the opening of salvation to all nations.<p><b>and in the day of salvation I helped you.&#8221;</b><br>The "day of salvation" signifies a decisive moment when God acts to deliver His people. Historically, this would have resonated with the Jewish understanding of God's deliverance from Egypt and other oppressors. In the New Testament context, it points to the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, emphasizing that God's help is both immediate and accessible.<p><b>Behold, now is the time of favor;</b><br>Paul emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of God's grace. The repetition of "now" highlights the present opportunity for salvation. This reflects the New Testament teaching that the coming of Christ has inaugurated a new era of grace, where the barriers between God and humanity are removed.<p><b>now is the day of salvation!</b><br>This declaration serves as a call to action, urging individuals to respond to God's offer of salvation without delay. It echoes the urgency found in other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>, which warns against hardening one's heart. The phrase underscores the belief that the present age is the time for repentance and faith in Christ, as the opportunity for salvation is available today.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, where Paul established a Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in the quoted Old Testament passage, offering His favor and salvation to His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet whose words Paul is quoting, specifically from <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, which speaks of God's promise of restoration and salvation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of believers facing various challenges in their spiritual and communal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_salvation.htm">The Urgency of Salvation</a></b><br>Salvation is not a distant promise but a present reality.

The tense of the Greek is better expressed by, <span class= "ital">I heard thee . . . I succoured thee.</span> As with other citations, it is a natural inference that St. Paul had the context, as well as the words actually cited, in his mind, and it is interesting, accordingly, to remember that context. The words (<a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>) are among those addressed at first to the servant of Jehovah, as "the light of the Gentiles;" then, apparently, in His name, as the Holy One, and in that of Jehovah, to Israel as a nation. In God's dealings with His people through Christ the Apostle saw the true fulfilment of Isaiah's words. Never, in spite of all outward calamities, had there been a time so acceptable, a day so full of deliverance.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, now is the accepted time . . .</span>--The word for "accepted" is much stronger than in the previous clause. <span class= "ital">Entirely acceptable</span> is, perhaps, its best equivalent. The solemnity of the words was, it may be, intensified in St. Paul's thoughts by what seemed to him the nearness of the impending judgment. Opportunities, as we should say, were offered which might never again recur. But the prolonged experience of the longsuffering of God has given to the words a yet more profound significance. There is, so to speak, a "now" running through the ages. For each church and nation, for each individual soul, there is a golden present which may never again recur, and in which lie boundless possibilities for the future. The words of the Apostle are, as it were, the transfigured expression of the generalisation of a wide experience which tells us that--<p>"There is a tide in the affairs of men<p>Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune:<p>Omitted, all the voyage of their life<p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries."<p>--Shakespeare, <span class= "ital">Julius C?sar,</span> iv. 3.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he saith;</span> that is, "God saith." The nominative is involved in the "<span class="accented">fellow workers</span>,"<span class="accented">so</span> that this is hardly to be classed with those rabbinic methods of citation found also in Philo, which deliberately omit the word "God" as the speaker, and use "He" by preference. <span class="cmt_word">I have heard thee,</span> etc. The quotation is from the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>, and is meant to express the necessity for receiving the grace of God, not only efficaciously, but at once. The "thee" in Isaiah is the Servant of Jehovah, the type primarily of Christ, and then of all who are "in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">In a time accepted;</span> literally, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">in a time of favour</span>. It is the season of grace, before grace has been wilfully rejected, and the time for judgment begins (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The accepted time;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the well-accepted opportunity</span>. St. Paul in his earnestness strengthens the force of the adjective. The same word occurs in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-12.htm">2 Corinthians 8:12</a>; <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16, 31</a>. <p><span class="accented">"There is a deep nick in Time's restless wheel<br />For each man's good."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Chapman.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Now</span>. No doubt St. Paul meant that, as long as life lasts, the door of repentance is never absolutely closed; but it is probable that he had specially in view the nearness of the advent of Christ.
