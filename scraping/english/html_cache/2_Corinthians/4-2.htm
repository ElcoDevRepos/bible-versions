In the context of Corinth, a city known for its moral laxity and diverse religious practices, this renunciation would have been a strong statement. The apostle contrasts the transparency of his ministry with the deceptive practices of false teachers. This renunciation echoes the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>, which urges believers to have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness.<p><b>We do not practice deceit,</b><br>Paul asserts the integrity of his ministry. Deceit was common among itinerant preachers of the time, who often sought personal gain. This statement aligns with the biblical principle of truthfulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, which states that the Lord detests lying lips. Paul's commitment to honesty reflects the character of Christ, who is the embodiment of truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>nor do we distort the word of God.</b><br>Paul is committed to preserving the purity of the Gospel message. Distortion of God's word was a significant issue, as false teachers often twisted Scripture for their own purposes. This commitment is consistent with the warning in <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm">2 Peter 3:16</a> about those who distort Scripture to their own destruction. Paul's approach ensures that the message remains centered on Christ and His redemptive work.<p><b>On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth,</b><br>Paul contrasts his ministry with those who operate in secrecy. The open proclamation signifies transparency and boldness, akin to the apostles' actions in <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>, where they prayed for boldness to speak God's word. This openness is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel, which is not hidden but declared openly to all.<p><b>we commend ourselves to every man&#8217;s conscience in the sight of God.</b><br>Paul appeals to the conscience of his listeners, suggesting that his conduct and message are above reproach. This appeal to conscience is significant in a Greco-Roman context, where personal honor and integrity were highly valued. The phrase "in the sight of God" underscores the ultimate accountability to God, aligning with passages like <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>, which reminds believers that nothing is hidden from God's sight. This accountability ensures that Paul's ministry is conducted with sincerity and divine approval.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to defend his ministry and encourage the believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality.

He has defended himself against the charge of "fickleness" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2Corinthians 1:17</a>), but another charge, more disturbing still, had also been brought against him. Men had talked, so he had been told, of his "craftiness" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.">2Corinthians 12:16</a>), and to that imputation, perhaps also to another covered by the same general term (see <a href="/ephesians/5-12.htm" title="For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.">Ephesians 5:12</a>, and Notes on <a href="/context/2_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.">2Corinthians 7:1-2</a>), he now addresses himself. The English word "dishonesty" is used in its older and wider sense. So in Wiclif we have "honest" members of the body in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-23.htm" title="And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.">1Corinthians 12:23</a>, and in Shakespeare and old English writers generally, and in popular usage even now, "honesty" in a woman is equivalent to chastity. The context shows, however, that St. Paul speaks chiefly not of sensual vices, nor yet of dishonesty in the modern sense of the word, but of subtlety, underhand practices, and the like. Men seem to have tried to fasten his reputation on the two horns of a dilemma. Either his change of plan indicated a discreditable fickleness, or if not that, something more discreditable still.<p><span class= "bld">Nor handling the word of God deceitfully.</span>--The word is nearly equivalent to the "corrupting" or "adulterating" of <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>. In "commending ourselves" we trace a return to the topic of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>. Yes, he acknowledged that he did "commend himself," but it was by the manifestation of truth as the only means that he adopted; and he appealed not to men's tastes, or prejudices, or humours, but to that in them which was highest--their conscience, their sense of right and wrong; and in doing this he felt that he was speaking and acting in the presence of the great Judge, who is also the searcher of hearts. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But have renounced;</span> rather, <span class="accented">but we renounced</span>.

"Honest" was originally like the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, a general expression for moral excellence, as in Pope's line - <p><span class="accented">"An honest man's the noblest work of God."</span> Fletcher's - <p><span class="accented">"Man is his own star, and the soul that can<br />Be honest is the only perfect man."</span> <span class="cmt_word">In craftiness.</span> The word implies all subtle, cunning, underhand dealing (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>), and it is clear from <a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a> that St. Paul had been charged with such conduct. The word is both used and illustrated in <a href="/luke/20-23.htm">Luke 20:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Handling the word of God deceitfully.</span> He has already repudiated this charge by implication in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>, and he was always anxious to maintain an attitude of transparent sincerity (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>) by uttering the truth and the whole truth (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; <a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), and not adulterating it. He had to meet such insinuations even in his first extant letter (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">By manifestation of the truth</span>. The constant recurrence to this thought shows the apostle's anxiety to remove the suspicion, created by the attacks of his opponents, that he had an <span class="accented">esoteric</span> teaching for some (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a>), kept some of his doctrines "The truth" cannot be preached by the aid of lies. The prominence of the word "manifest" in this Epistle is remarkable. St. Paul seems to be haunted by it (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">2 Corinthians 2:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-6.htm">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Commending ourselves.</span> This is the only form of self-commendation or of "commendatory letter" for which I care.

These solemn appeals are meant to show that it would be morally impossible for him to act as he was charged with acting. If he can assert his own integrity he will do so only as consciously in the presence of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
