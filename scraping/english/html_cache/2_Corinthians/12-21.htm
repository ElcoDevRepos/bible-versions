This reflects his pastoral heart and the responsibility he feels for the spiritual well-being of the believers. His previous visits to Corinth were marked by challenges, as seen in <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18:1-11</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5-9</a>, where he dealt with issues of division and immorality. The phrase indicates a sense of apprehension, suggesting that Paul anticipates confronting unresolved issues.<p><b>my God will humble me before you</b><br>Paul acknowledges that God may use the situation to humble him, highlighting his submission to God's will. This humility is consistent with Paul's teachings in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>, where he emphasizes the importance of humility and servanthood, modeled by Christ. The potential humbling could involve Paul witnessing the spiritual failures of the Corinthians, which would be a source of personal sorrow and a reminder of his own limitations as a leader.<p><b>and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier</b><br>Paul anticipates sorrow over those who continue in sin despite previous admonitions. This reflects the ongoing struggle within the Corinthian church, as addressed in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a>, where Paul dealt with issues of immorality. The grief Paul mentions is akin to the godly sorrow he describes in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm">2 Corinthians 7:9-10</a>, which leads to repentance and salvation.<p><b>and have not repented of their acts of impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery</b><br>Paul lists specific sins that were prevalent in Corinth, a city known for its moral laxity and pagan practices. The call to repentance is central to Paul's message, as seen in <a href="/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>, where he declares that God commands all people to repent. The sins mentioned&#8212;impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery&#8212;are often linked in Paul's writings (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>) as behaviors that are incompatible with the kingdom of God.
