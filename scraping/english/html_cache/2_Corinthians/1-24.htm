This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25-28</a>, where He instructs His disciples to lead by serving. The early church faced challenges with authority, and Paul distinguishes his approach from that of false apostles who sought control (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-20.htm">2 Corinthians 11:20</a>). This phrase underscores the humility and servant-hearted nature of true Christian leadership.<p><b>but we are fellow workers with you for your joy</b><br>Paul sees himself as a co-laborer with the Corinthians, highlighting the collaborative nature of ministry. This aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>, where Paul describes believers as "God's fellow workers." The goal of this partnership is the joy of the believers, which is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/philippians/1-25.htm">Philippians 1:25</a>). Joy is seen as a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and a sign of spiritual maturity and health.<p><b>because it is by faith that you stand firm</b><br>Faith is the foundation of the Christian life, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Paul emphasizes that it is not human effort or wisdom that enables believers to stand firm, but faith in Christ. This echoes <a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16</a>, where faith is described as a shield that extinguishes the flaming arrows of the evil one.

He puts forward, therefore, the other side of his work. He was really seeking, not to domineer, or cause pain, but to be a fellow-worker with their "joy and peace in believing" (<a href="/romans/15-13.htm" title="Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:13</a>).
