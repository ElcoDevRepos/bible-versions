In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the mixed reactions to the message of Christ. The "odor that brings death" refers to those who reject the Gospel. In biblical times, incense was used in both religious ceremonies and funerals, symbolizing both life and death. The imagery here suggests that the same message can lead to spiritual death for those who refuse it, echoing the idea found in <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>, where the Lord is a sanctuary for some and a stone of stumbling for others. This concept is also seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7-8</a>, where Christ is a cornerstone for believers but a rock of offense for unbelievers.<p><b>to the other a fragrance that brings life</b><br>Conversely, for those who accept the Gospel, it is a "fragrance that brings life." This reflects the transformative power of the message of Christ, which leads to eternal life. The metaphor of fragrance is significant in the ancient world, where pleasant aromas were associated with joy, celebration, and divine presence. In <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, Christ's sacrificial love is described as a "fragrant offering," indicating that believers, through their acceptance of the Gospel, partake in the life-giving aroma of Christ's sacrifice. This duality underscores the personal responsibility in responding to the Gospel message.<p><b>And who is qualified for such a task?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the gravity and responsibility of spreading the Gospel. Paul acknowledges the weight of the task, suggesting that human ability alone is insufficient. The question points to the need for divine empowerment and guidance, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5-6</a>, where Paul states that our competence comes from God. This humility is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, where he often contrasts human weakness with God's strength (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). The task of being a messenger of the Gospel requires reliance on the Holy Spirit, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God equipping those He calls.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.

In a Roman triumph, soldiers burned incense; to the defeated captives that same sweet scent meant impending execution.<p>&#8226; Likewise, when the gospel is proclaimed, those who persist in unbelief inhale a scent that seals their doom.

To those who reject it, the scent confirms their march toward death; to those who embrace it, the same aroma breathes eternal life. Such awesome consequences leave no room for self-confidence. Only God can qualify weak vessels to carry this life-and-death message, and He graciously does so for all who trust and obey Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">To the one we are the savour of death unto death.</span>--As with other instances of St. Paul's figurative language, we note the workings of a deeply, though unconsciously, poetic imagination. Keeping the image of the triumph in his mind, he thinks of the widely different impression and effect which the odour of the incense would work in the two classes of the prisoners. To some it would seem to be as a breath from Paradise, giving life and health; to others its sweetness would seem sickly and pestilential, coming as from a charnel house, having in it the "savour of death," and leading to death as its issue.<p><span class= "bld">And who is sufficient for these things?</span>--The question forced itself on St. Paul's mind as it forces itself on the mind of every true teacher, Who can feel qualified for a work which involves such tremendous issues? If we ask how it was that he did not draw back from it altogether, the answer is found in other words of his: "God has made us able (<span class= "ital">sufficient</span>) ministers of the New Testament" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2Corinthians 3:6</a>); "our sufficiency is of God" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;">2Corinthians 3:5</a>). It is obvious that even here he assumes his sufficiency, and gives in the next verse the ground of the assumption.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The savour of death unto death;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a savour from death to death</span>. To those who are perishing, the incense of the Name of Christ which our work enables them to breathe, seems to rise from death, and to lead to death. They (for here again the outlines of the metaphor shift) are like the doomed captives, who, as they breathed the incense on the day of triumph, knew where that triumph would lead them before the victors can climb the Capitol. To them it would seem to bring with it not "airs from heaven," but wafts from the abyss. So Christ was alike for the fall and for the rising again of many (<a href="/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>). To some he was a Stone of stumbling (<a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>; <a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>), which grinds to powder those on whom it falls (<a href="/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). This contrast between the intended effect of the gospel as the power and wisdom of God, and its <span class="accented">accidental</span> effect, through man's sin and blindness which converts it into a source of judgment, is often alluded to in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18, 23, 24</a>; <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>, etc.). St. Paul is fond of intensified expressions, like "from death unto death," as in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; "from faith to faith," etc. (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Savour of life unto life;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a savour from life</span>, as before. It came from the Source of life; it is issued in the sole reality of life. Similarly the rabbis spoke of the Law as "an aroma" alike of death and of life. "Why are the words of the Law likened to princes (<a href="/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>)? Because, like princes, <span class="accented">they have the power to kill and to give life</span>.
