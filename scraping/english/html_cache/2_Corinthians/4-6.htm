It highlights God's sovereign power to bring order and illumination where there is chaos and obscurity. This act of creation is a type of spiritual illumination, symbolizing how God brings spiritual enlightenment to the human heart. The imagery of light overcoming darkness is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, where the light of Christ shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. This reflects God's ability to transform spiritual darkness into light through His divine intervention.<p><b>made His light shine in our hearts</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and transformative work of God in the believer's life. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. The light shining in our hearts signifies the internal revelation and understanding of God's truth, akin to the new birth described in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>. This transformation is not merely intellectual but deeply spiritual, affecting the believer's entire being. It is reminiscent of the prophecy in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit to His people.<p><b>to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God</b><br>This phrase speaks to the purpose of God's illumination: to impart knowledge of His glory. The glory of God is His manifest presence and divine attributes, often revealed in Scripture through His acts of salvation and judgment. In <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18-23</a>, Moses asks to see God's glory, and God reveals His goodness and mercy. The knowledge of God's glory is not just intellectual but experiential, involving a personal relationship with Him. This knowledge is transformative, leading to a life that reflects God's character and purposes.<p><b>in the face of Jesus Christ.</b><br>The culmination of God's revelation is found in Jesus Christ, who is the exact representation of God's being (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). The face of Jesus Christ signifies the personal and relational aspect of knowing God, as seen in <a href="/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>, where Jesus tells Philip that anyone who has seen Him has seen the Father. Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God's glory, embodying grace and truth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This phrase underscores the centrality of Christ in the believer's understanding of God, as He is the mediator of the new covenant and the one through whom believers have access to the Father (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who commanded light to shine out of darkness, both in the physical creation and in the spiritual illumination of believers' hearts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The face of Jesus Christ is the manifestation of God's glory and the source of spiritual light and knowledge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote this letter to the Corinthians, emphasizing the transformative power of God's light in believers' lives.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of this letter resided, known for its diverse culture and challenges to the early church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event referenced by Paul, where God spoke light into existence, symbolizing the new creation in believers' hearts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Just as God spoke light into existence at creation, His Word has the power to illuminate our hearts and minds, bringing spiritual understanding and transformation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_god_in_christ.htm">The Glory of God in Christ</a></b><br>The ultimate revelation of God's glory is found in Jesus Christ.

Probably, however, there is a reference to the glory of God, not as <span class="accented">reflected</span> from the face of Christ, but as concentrated in and beaming from it (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
