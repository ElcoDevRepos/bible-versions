In the context of <a href="/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>, Paul is discussing the inability of the Jewish people to understand the true meaning of the Old Testament scriptures. This spiritual blindness is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and <a href="/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>, where the people hear but do not understand. The closing of their minds is a result of their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, which prevents them from seeing the fulfillment of the law and the prophets in Him.<p><b>For to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant.</b><br>The "veil" here is a metaphor for the lack of understanding and spiritual insight. Paul is drawing a parallel to the veil Moses wore after receiving the law on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/34-33.htm">Exodus 34:33-35</a>). Just as Moses' veil covered the glory of God, the metaphorical veil covers the understanding of the Jewish people when they read the Old Testament. This veil signifies the separation between God and humanity due to sin, which is a theme throughout the Bible, beginning with the separation in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3).<p><b>It has not been lifted,</b><br>The persistence of the veil indicates that the spiritual blindness continues. This is a historical reality that Paul observed in his time, as many Jews continued to adhere strictly to the law without recognizing its fulfillment in Christ. The lifting of the veil is a divine act, suggesting that human effort alone cannot achieve true understanding or salvation. This aligns with the biblical teaching that salvation is by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>because only in Christ can it be removed.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the centrality of Christ in the removal of spiritual blindness. Jesus is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), and only through Him can one truly understand the scriptures. This removal of the veil is akin to the new covenant, where believers are given a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). The concept of Christ as the key to understanding and salvation is echoed in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the way, the truth, and the life.

Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>. Here, as applied to the faculties of perception, "blinded" is, perhaps, a legitimate rendering.<p><span class= "bld">Remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament . . .</span>--The words are better translated: <span class= "ital">the same veil remaineth in the reading of the old covenant; the fact not being revealed </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by the removal of the veil) <span class= "ital">that it</span> (the old covenant) <span class= "ital">is being done away in Christ</span> The figure is passing through a kind of dissolving change. There is still a veil between the hearers of the Law and its true meaning; but the veil is no longer on the face of the law-giver, but on their hearts; and the reason of this is that, the veil not being withdrawn, they do not see that the glory of the older covenant is done away by the brightness of the new. It is doing violence to the context to refer to the veil the words "is done away," which through the whole passage is applied to the Law itself; and in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.">2Corinthians 3:16</a> a new and appropriate word is used for the withdrawal of the veil. It is, the Apostle says, because the veil of prejudice and tradition hinders them from seeing the truth that the Jews of his own time still think of the Law as permanent, instead of looking on it as passing through a process of extinction. The "Old Testament" is clearly used, not, as in the modern sense, for the whole volume of the Law--Prophets and Psalms--but specially for the law which was the basis of the covenant. The other, but less adequate, rendering would be, <span class= "ital">the veil remaineth</span> . . . <span class= "ital">unwithdrawn, for it</span> (the veil) <span class= "ital">is abolished in Christ.</span> If there was any authority for giving an active force to the middle form of the verb, we might translate with a perfectly satisfactory meaning, <span class= "ital">the same veil remaineth</span> . . . <span class= "ital">not revealing the fact that it is being done away in Christ;</span> but unfortunately there is no such authority. The English, "which veil is done away," fails to give, in any case, the true force of the Greek.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their minds</span>. This word is rendered" devices" in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>; "minds" in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> and 2 Cor 4:4; and "thought" in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>. It means that their powers of reason were, so to speak, petrified. <span class="cmt_word">Were blinded;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were hardened</span>. The verb cannot mean" to blind." By whom were their minds hardened? It would be equally correct to say by themselves (<a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8</a>), or by Satan (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>), or by God (<a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same veil.</span> Of course the meaning is "a veil of which the veil of Moses is an exact type." The veil which prevented them from seeing the evanescence of the light which shone on the face of Moses was symbolically identical with that which prevented them also from seeing the transitory character of his Law. It had been as it were taken from his face and laid on their hearts (see <a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27-29</a>; <a href="/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>.). Many commentators have seen in this verse a reference to the Jewish custom of covering the head with the <span class="accented">tallith</span>, a four-cornered veil, when they were in the synagogues. But this is doubtful, since the <span class="accented">tallith</span> did not cover the eyes. More probably his metaphor may have been suggested by <a href="/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, "And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast ever all people, and <span class="accented">the veil</span> that is spread over all nations." <span class="cmt_word">Untaken away.</span> There are two other ways of rendering this verse: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "For until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth unlifted; which veil is done away in Christ," as in the Revised Version; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "The same veil remaineth, it not being revealed that it is done away in Christ," as it is taken by Chrysostom and many others, and in the margin of the Revised Version. The latter seems to be the better view. It is not the veil, but the old covenant, which is being done away in Christ. To the Jews that truth still remained under a veil. The present tense, "is <span class="accented">in course</span> of annulment," might naturally be used until the utter abrogation of even the possible fulfilment of the Mosaic Law at the fall of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">In the reading of the old testament;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the old covenant</span>. There is no allusion to the Old Testament as a <span class="accented">book</span>, but the phrase is equivalent to "Moses is read" in the next verse. (On this obduracy of the Jews, see <a href="/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7, 8, 25</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
