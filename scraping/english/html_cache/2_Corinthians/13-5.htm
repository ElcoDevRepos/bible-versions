In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing a church that has been influenced by false apostles and is questioning his authority. The call to "examine yourselves" is a challenge to the Corinthians to assess their own spiritual condition and authenticity of their faith. This self-examination is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40</a> and <a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>, where believers are encouraged to search their hearts and align with God's truth. The phrase implies a personal responsibility to ensure one's beliefs and actions align with the teachings of Christ.<p><b>test yourselves.</b><br>The concept of testing oneself is akin to the process of refining metals, where impurities are removed to reveal the true quality. In a spiritual sense, this involves evaluating one's life against the standards of the Gospel. The Greek word used here for "test" (dokimazo) suggests proving or approving something after examination. This is not a superficial test but a deep, honest assessment of one's faith and relationship with God. The idea is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a>, where believers are instructed to examine themselves before partaking in the Lord's Supper, ensuring they are in right standing with God.<p><b>Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the indwelling presence of Christ in believers, a fundamental tenet of Christian doctrine. The indwelling of Christ is a mystery revealed in the New Testament, signifying a profound union between Christ and the believer. This concept is supported by passages such as <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which speak of Christ living in believers and being the hope of glory. The presence of Christ within is both a source of spiritual strength and a standard for living a life that reflects His character and teachings.<p><b>unless you fail the test?</b><br>The possibility of failing the test serves as a sobering warning. It suggests that not all who profess faith may truly possess it. This echoes the warnings found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, where Jesus speaks of those who outwardly perform religious acts but lack a genuine relationship with Him. The phrase implies that true faith will manifest in a life transformed by Christ's presence. The test is not merely about doctrinal correctness but about the evidence of Christ's life and power at work within the believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with pastoral concern and apostolic authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the faith and the one in whom believers are to find their identity and assurance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-examination</a></b><br>The process Paul urges the Corinthians to undertake, reflecting on their faith and relationship with Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/faith.htm">Faith</a></b><br>The core subject of examination, referring to the genuine belief and trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_self-examination.htm">The Importance of Self-Examination</a></b><br>Regular self-examination is crucial for spiritual growth and assurance of faith.

We test ourselves by the clear markers Scripture provides, confident that where true faith exists, Christ Himself indwells and empowers. If the test exposes emptiness, the remedy is immediate repentance and trust in the Savior who gladly moves in and transforms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.</span>--The position of "yourselves" in the Greek (before the verb in both clauses) shows that that is the word on which stress is emphatically laid, and the thought grows out of what had been said in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.">2Corinthians 13:3</a> : "You seek a test of my power. Apply a test to <span class= "ital">yourselves.</span> Try <span class= "ital">yourselves</span> whether you are living and moving in that faith in Christ which you profess" (the objective and subjective senses of faith melting into one without any formal distinction). "Subject <span class= "ital">yourselves</span> to the scrutiny of your own conscience." The latter word had been used in a like sense in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-28.htm" title="But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.">1Corinthians 11:28</a>. So far as we can distinguish between it and the Greek for "examine," the one suggests the idea of a special test, the other a general scrutiny.<p><span class= "bld">How that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?</span>--On the last word see Notes on <a href="/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>. Here its exact meaning is defined by the context as that of failing to pass the scrutiny to which he calls them: "Christ is in you" (the central thought of the Apostle's teaching; <a href="/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-22.htm" title="In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>), "unless the sentence, after an impartial scrutiny by yourselves, or by a judge gifted with spiritual discernment, is that there are no tokens of His presence." The ideas which Calvinistic theology has attached to the word "reprobate" are, it need hardly be said, foreign to the true meaning of the word, both here and elsewhere. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prove year ownselves.</span> In other words, "test your own sincerity." <span class="cmt_word">Jesus Christ is in you.</span> To this truth - that the body of every Christian is a temple of the Holy Spirit of Christ - St. Paul returns again and again (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>).
