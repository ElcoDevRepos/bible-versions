The "One" refers to God the Father, who is the source of life and power. The resurrection of Jesus is a foundational event in Christian theology, affirming Jesus' divinity and the truth of His teachings. This act of raising Jesus from the dead is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's victory over death. The resurrection is also a demonstration of God's power, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>, where Paul describes the immeasurable greatness of God's power toward believers, as demonstrated in Christ's resurrection.<p><b>will also raise us with Jesus</b><br>This promise of resurrection extends to all believers, indicating that just as Christ was raised, so too will His followers be raised. This reflects the hope of eternal life and the future resurrection of the dead, a core belief in Christian eschatology. The phrase "with Jesus" signifies the union believers have with Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5</a>, which states that if we have been united with Him in a death like His, we will certainly also be united with Him in a resurrection like His. This union is both spiritual and physical, promising a future bodily resurrection.<p><b>and present us with you in His presence</b><br>The final part of the verse speaks to the communal aspect of salvation and resurrection. Paul is addressing the Corinthian church, indicating that both he and the believers in Corinth will be presented together before God. This presentation is not just individual but corporate, highlighting the unity of the body of Christ. The phrase "in His presence" suggests a future time when believers will stand before God, fully redeemed and glorified. This aligns with passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, which describe the gathering of believers to meet the Lord. The concept of being presented before God also echoes the imagery of a bride being presented to the bridegroom, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, symbolizing purity and readiness for eternal communion with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse group of believers in the city of Corinth, facing various challenges and needing reassurance of their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the verse, as the one who was raised from the dead, providing the foundation for Christian hope in resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "the One who raised the Lord Jesus," emphasizing His power and role in the resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection_event.htm">The Resurrection Event</a></b><br>The pivotal event in Christian theology, affirming Jesus' victory over death and the promise of eternal life for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_resurrection.htm">Assurance of Resurrection</a></b><br>Believers can have confidence in their future resurrection because it is grounded in the historical fact of Jesus' resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The promise of being "presented with you" highlights the communal aspect of salvation, encouraging unity and fellowship among believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding the certainty of resurrection should influence how we live today, prioritizing eternal values over temporary concerns.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The same God who raised Jesus will fulfill His promise to raise us, underscoring His faithfulness and reliability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_suffering.htm">Hope in Suffering</a></b><br>In the context of suffering and trials, the assurance of resurrection provides hope and strength to endure, knowing that present struggles are temporary.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_4_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 4:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_2_Cor_4_14_boost_faith.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 4:14 strengthen your faith in Jesus' resurrection power?

The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">with Jesus,</span> the Received text having apparently originated in a desire to adapt the words to the fact that Christ had already risen. St. Paul's thoughts, however, dwell so continually on his fellowship with Christ that he thinks of the future resurrection of the body, no less than of the spiritual resurrection which he has already experienced (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>), as not only wrought <span class= "ital">by</span> Him but associated <span class= "ital">with</span> Him; and in this hope of his he includes the Corinthians to whom he writes. It will then be seen, he trusts, that "life" has indeed been "working" in them. The verb "present," as describing the work of Christ, and, we may add, his own work as a minister of Christ, under this aspect, is a favourite one with St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which raised up the Lord Jesus</span> (see <a href="/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>).
