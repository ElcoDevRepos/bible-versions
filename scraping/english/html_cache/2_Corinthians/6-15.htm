In biblical literature, Belial is often used as a personification of evil or worthlessness, sometimes equated with Satan. The rhetorical question emphasizes the incompatibility between the holy nature of Christ and the corrupt nature of evil. This reflects the broader biblical theme of separation between light and darkness, as seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5-7</a>, which speaks of God as light and in Him there is no darkness. The use of "harmony" suggests a musical metaphor, implying that just as discordant notes cannot produce a harmonious melody, so too can Christ and Belial not coexist in agreement.<p><b>Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?</b><br>This phrase underscores the fundamental differences in values, beliefs, and purposes between those who follow Christ and those who do not. The term "believer" refers to someone who has faith in Jesus Christ and lives according to His teachings, while "unbeliever" denotes someone who rejects or is indifferent to the Christian faith. This distinction is rooted in the biblical call for believers to live a life set apart, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, which describes Christians as a chosen people and a royal priesthood. The question challenges believers to consider the implications of forming close partnerships or alliances with those who do not share their faith, echoing the Old Testament warnings against intermarriage with pagan nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>) and the New Testament exhortation to not be unequally yoked with unbelievers (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).

The Hebrew word signifies "vileness, worthlessness;" and the "sons of Belial" (as in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm" title="Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known;">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm" title="Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.">1Samuel 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-17.htm" title="Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.">1Samuel 25:17</a>) were therefore the worthless and the vile. The English version, following the Vulgate, translates the phrase as though Belial were a proper name, and this has led to the current belief, as shown in Milton's poems, that it was the name of a demon or fallen angel, the representative of impurity--<p>"Belial came last, than whom a spirit more lewd,<p>Fell not from heaven, or more gross to love<p>Vice for itself."--<span class= "ital">Paradise Lost,</span> i. 490.<p>"Belial, the dissolutest spirit that fell,<p>The sensualest, and, after Asmodai, . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Concord</span>; literally, <span class="accented">harmony</span> or <span class="accented">accord</span>.

Thus in <a href="/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a> "a naughty person" is <span class="accented">adam belial</span>. "A son of Belial" means "a child of wickedness" by a common Hebraism (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>).
