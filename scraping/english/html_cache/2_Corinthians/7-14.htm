This reflects the deep relationship and mutual respect between Paul and the Corinthians. In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was often seen as a way to establish credibility and honor.

I always spoke the truth <span class="accented">to you</span>; but I might well have feared that, in speaking <span class="accented">of you</span> to Titus, my affection for you had led me to overstep the limits of perfect accuracy.
