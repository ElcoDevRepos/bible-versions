"Paradise" is often understood as a place of divine presence and bliss, akin to the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>) and the promise of eternal life (<a href="/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>). In Jewish and early Christian thought, Paradise is sometimes equated with the third heaven, a concept of layered heavens. This experience underscores the reality of the spiritual realm and the hope of eternal communion with God.<p><b>The things he heard were inexpressible,</b><br>Paul's encounter involved hearing divine revelations that were beyond human language. This suggests the limitations of human understanding when faced with the divine. The inexpressibility of these revelations highlights the sacredness and mystery of God's communication, similar to the ineffable name of God in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>). It emphasizes the transcendence of God's wisdom and the depth of spiritual truths that surpass human comprehension.<p><b>things that man is not permitted to tell.</b><br>This indicates that certain divine revelations are not meant for public disclosure, reflecting a theme of divine secrecy found in other scriptures (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>). It suggests that some aspects of God's plan are reserved for His timing and purposes. This also parallels the idea of Jesus instructing His disciples to keep certain revelations private until the appropriate time (<a href="/matthew/17-9.htm">Matthew 17:9</a>). It underscores the responsibility and humility required in handling divine knowledge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, who is recounting a personal experience of being caught up to Paradise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paradise.htm">Paradise</a></b><br>A term used to describe a place of divine presence and bliss, often associated with heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_third_heaven.htm">The Third Heaven</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, earlier in the chapter, Paul refers to being caught up to the third heaven, which is synonymous with Paradise in this context.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unutterable_words.htm">The Unutterable Words</a></b><br>The sacred and indescribable revelations Paul received, which he was not permitted to disclose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, who were being addressed regarding issues of spiritual authority and authenticity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_heavenly_experiences.htm">The Reality of Heavenly Experiences</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s experience reminds us that spiritual realities exist beyond our earthly understanding.

Paradise (see Note on <a href="/luke/23-43.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, To day shall you be with me in paradise.">Luke 23:43</a>) was emphatically the dwelling-place of the souls of the righteous, the reproduction in the unseen world of the lost beauty of the Garden of Eden--the "paradise of joy," as the LXX. in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm" title="And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.">Genesis 2:15</a> translates the name. There, flowing about the throne of God, was the fountain of the water of life, and the tree of life growing on its banks (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1-2</a>). Speculations on the question whether St. Paul thought of it as nearer or farther from earth than the third heaven are obviously idle and profitless. The nearest approach which we can make to an adequate distinction between the two visions is that the first revealed to his gaze the glory of the Throne of God, with angels and archangels round it, and seraphim and cherubim,--a vision like that of Moses (<a href="/exodus/24-10.htm" title="And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.">Exodus 24:10</a>), and Isaiah (<a href="/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>), and Ezekiel (<a href="/context/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>), and St. John (<a href="/context/revelation/4-2.htm" title="And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.">Revelation 4:2-11</a>)--thoughts like those of Hooker's death-bed (Walton's <span class= "ital">Life</span>)--while the latter brought before his spirit the peace and rest ineffable, even in their intermediate and therefore imperfect state, of the souls who had fallen asleep in Christ and were waiting for their resurrection. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into Paradise.</span> Here, again, we encounter long speculations as to whether Paradise is the same as the third heaven; whether St.,Paul is referring to two visions or two parts of one vision.
