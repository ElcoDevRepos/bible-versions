The grace of Jesus is not merely a theological concept but a lived reality, demonstrated through His actions and sacrifice. The term "grace" (Greek: charis) refers to unmerited favor, a gift from God that cannot be earned. This grace is foundational to the Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift of grace through faith. The use of "our Lord Jesus Christ" underscores the personal relationship believers have with Jesus, acknowledging His lordship and divinity.<p><b>that though He was rich</b><br>This phrase refers to the pre-incarnate glory and divine status of Jesus Christ. Before His incarnation, Jesus existed in the form of God, possessing all the riches of heaven. <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a> speaks of Christ, who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to His own advantage. The richness here is not merely material but encompasses the fullness of divine glory, authority, and power. This richness is also reflected in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word, who was with God and was God, involved in the creation of all things.<p><b>yet for your sake He became poor</b><br>This phrase highlights the incarnation and the humility of Christ. Jesus willingly set aside His divine privileges and took on human form, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where He made Himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant. His poverty is seen in His humble birth in a manger, His life without earthly wealth, and ultimately His sacrificial death on the cross. This act of becoming poor was for the sake of humanity, demonstrating the selfless love of Christ. The concept of substitutionary atonement is evident here, where Christ took on human limitations and suffering to bring salvation to mankind.<p><b>so that you through His poverty might become rich</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the purpose of Christ's incarnation and sacrifice. The richness believers receive is spiritual, encompassing forgiveness of sins, eternal life, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> speaks of believers being blessed with every spiritual blessing in Christ. The richness is also eschatological, pointing to the future inheritance believers have in the kingdom of God, as mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>. This transformation from poverty to richness is a central theme of the gospel, where believers are adopted into God's family and become co-heirs with Christ, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage generosity and highlight the example of Christ's sacrificial love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and affluent congregation in a major Greek city, being encouraged to contribute to the collection for the impoverished church in Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this verse, whose incarnation and sacrificial life are presented as the ultimate example of grace and generosity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_macedonian_churches.htm">The Macedonian Churches</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the chapter as an example of generosity despite their own poverty, serving as a model for the Corinthians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_collection_for_the_saints.htm">The Collection for the Saints</a></b><br>The event prompting this letter, a fundraising effort for the impoverished believers in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_grace.htm">Understanding Grace</a></b><br>Recognize that grace is unmerited favor, exemplified by Christ's willingness to leave His heavenly riches for our sake.

This is doubtless the chief thought expressed, but we can scarcely doubt that the words refer also to the outward aspect of our Lord's life. He chose the lot of the poor, almost of the beggar (the Greek word "poor" is so translated, and rightly, in <a href="/context/luke/16-20.htm" title="And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,">Luke 16:20-22</a>), as Francis of Assisi and others have done in seeking to follow in His steps. And this He did that men might by that spectacle of a life of self-surrender be sharers with Him in the eternal wealth of the Spirit, and find their treasure not in earth but heaven. As regards the outward mendicant aspect of our Lord's life, and that of His disciples, see Notes on <a href="/matthew/10-10.htm" title="Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.">Matthew 10:10</a>; <a href="/context/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The word "grace," as in vers. 4, 6, 7, here means "gracious beneficence." <span class="cmt_word">Though he was rich</span> (<a href="/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Became poor.</span> The aorist implies the concentration of his self-sacrifice in a single act. <span class="cmt_word">By his poverty.</span> The word "his" in the Greek implies the <span class="accented">greatness</span> of Christ.
