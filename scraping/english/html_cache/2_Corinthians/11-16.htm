This repetition underscores the seriousness of his defense against false apostles. In biblical literature, repetition is often used to draw attention to key points, as seen in Jesus' teachings (e.g., "Truly, truly, I say to you").<p><b>Let no one take me for a fool:</b><br>Paul is addressing the Corinthians' perception of him. In the Greco-Roman world, wisdom and eloquence were highly valued, and Paul&#8217;s straightforward preaching style might have seemed foolish to some. This echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-25</a>, where Paul discusses the perceived foolishness of the Gospel.<p><b>But if you do:</b><br>Paul acknowledges that some may still view him as foolish despite his efforts. This reflects the tension between worldly wisdom and spiritual truth, a recurring theme in his letters.<p><b>Then receive me as a fool:</b><br>Paul uses irony here, asking to be received as a fool to make a point. This rhetorical strategy highlights the absurdity of the Corinthians' standards and challenges them to reconsider their values.<p><b>So that I too may boast a little:</b><br>Paul reluctantly engages in boasting to counteract the false apostles who were boasting of their credentials. This is a strategic move to establish his authority and credibility. In <a href="/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-10</a>, Paul contrasts his boasting with his weaknesses, ultimately pointing to Christ's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.

Paul is circling back to a theme he has already raised (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 11</a>:1; 11:4).<p>&#8226; His repetition underscores urgency, much like his twice-spoken warning in <a href="/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that repetition is a divine teaching tool (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>), so we treat every repeated word as intentional and authoritative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let no one take me for a fool</b><p>&#8226;

The literal command guards both Paul&#8217;s credibility and the Corinthians&#8217; discernment; dismissing a true apostle as a fool opens the door to actual fools&#8212;&#8220;false apostles, deceitful workers&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 11</a>:13).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4</a> believers are warned, &#8220;Do not answer a fool according to his folly,&#8221; affirming Paul&#8217;s reluctance to engage in empty self-promotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But if you do, then receive me as a fool</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/2_corinthians/11-19.htm">2 Corinthians 11:19</a> says, &#8220;For you gladly put up with fools,&#8221; so Paul meets them where they are, yet without compromising truth.<p>&#8226; This rhetorical move exposes the absurdity of boasting apostles by letting them taste their own standard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that I too may boast a little</b><p>&#8226; The aim is limited&#8212;&#8220;a little.&#8221; Paul contrasts his brief, reluctant boasting with the swagger of his opponents (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:12, 18).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;boast&#8221; will spotlight God&#8217;s work, not self-glory, in line with <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/10-17.htm">2 Corinthians 10:17</a>, &#8220;Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8226;
