This plea reflects the deep relational aspect of Paul's ministry, emphasizing reconciliation and unity within the body of Christ. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of emotions and will, indicating a call for genuine acceptance and love. This echoes Jesus' teaching on love and unity among believers (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>We have wronged no one,</b><br>Paul defends his integrity and the integrity of his ministry team. The term "wronged" suggests causing harm or injustice. In the context of Corinth, a city known for its moral and social challenges, Paul reassures the believers that his conduct has been above reproach. This aligns with his earlier teachings on living blamelessly (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><b>we have corrupted no one,</b><br>Corruption here implies leading someone into moral or spiritual decay. Paul asserts that his ministry has not led anyone astray from the truth of the Gospel. This is significant in a culture where false teachings and idolatry were prevalent. It reflects Paul's commitment to the purity of the Gospel message, as seen in his warnings against false apostles (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>).<p><b>we have exploited no one.</b><br>Exploitation involves taking advantage of others for personal gain. Paul emphasizes that his ministry has not been for selfish purposes but for the benefit of the Corinthians. This statement counters any accusations of financial or personal manipulation, reinforcing his earlier teachings on selfless service (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5-6</a>). It also reflects the character of Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians, addressing the church with a plea for reconciliation and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in the city of Corinth, known for its moral and spiritual challenges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A fellow worker with Paul, who had previously visited the Corinthian church and brought back a report to Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>- The region where Paul was when he wrote this letter, experiencing both external conflicts and internal fears.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/achaia.htm">Achaia</a></b><br>- The region where Corinth is located, significant in the spread of early Christianity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_ministry.htm">Integrity in Ministry</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes that he has wronged, corrupted, or exploited no one.

Now he invites them to reciprocate.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Make room&#8221; pictures removing obstacles so affection can flow. Think of clearing space in a cluttered room so someone can sit down.<p>&#8226; He is not asking for blind loyalty but for restored fellowship based on truth (<a href="/galatians/4-12.htm">Galatians 4:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The appeal is relational, echoing Jesus&#8217; call to abide in love (<a href="/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have wronged no one</b><p>Accusations had swirled that Paul&#8217;s ministry was manipulative.

There is an almost infinite pathos in that entreaty, uttered, we may well believe, as from the very depths of the soul--"Make room for us." The under-current of thought flows on. He had complained of their being straitened in their affections, had entreated that they would enlarge their hearts towards him, as his heart was enlarged towards them. He has travelled on--his thoughts turning now to the party of license, with whom he had pleaded so earnestly in 1 Corinthians 8-10--to the terribly unutterable contaminations to which they were exposing themselves by their companionship with idolaters. He now, almost, as it were, with sobs, entreats once more: "You can find a place for such as these in your heart. Have you no place for me?" In the words "we wronged no man" we find reference to charges of greed of gain and self-interested motives that had been whispered against him, and to which he refers again in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2Corinthians 12:18</a>. Perhaps, also, he contrasts himself with others, who "did wrong and defrauded" (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.">1Corinthians 6:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">We have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</span>--The word for "corrupt" is the same as that translated "defile" in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.">1Corinthians 3:17</a>, and is used with manifest reference to sensual impurity in <a href="/2_peter/2-12.htm" title="But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;">2Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="/jude/1-10.htm" title="But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.">Jude 1:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm" title="For true and righteous are his judgments: for he has judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.">Revelation 19:2</a>. The word for "defrauded" is not the same as that in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-8.htm" title="No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.">1Corinthians 6:8</a>, and though meaning literally "to make a gain," or "seek a gain," had, with its cognate nouns, acquired a darker shade of meaning. The verb is used in obvious connection with impurity in <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1Thessalonians 4:3-6</a>, where see Note. The nouns often appear in closest companionship with those which indicate that form of evil (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortionists, or with idolaters; for then must you needs go out of the world.">1Corinthians 5:10-11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>). Mere greed of gain is commonly described by another word, which we translate "the love of money" (<a href="/luke/16-14.htm" title="And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.">Luke 16:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1Timothy 6:10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm" title="For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,">2Timothy 3:2</a>). There seems, then, sufficient reason for connecting this verb also with the same class of sins. It would seem as if the word had colloquially acquired a secondary meaning, and was used of those who sought gain by ministering to the vice of others--who became, as it were, purveyors of impurity. The words, so understood, give us a momentary glimpse into a depth of evil from which we would willingly turn our eyes. But they leave no room for doubt that, in the infinite pruriency of such a city as Corinth, even such things as these had been said of the Apostle in the cynical jests of the paganising party of license. They tolerated such things themselves. They welcomed those who practised them to their friendship (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1Corinthians 5:11</a>). They whispered, we may well believe, of private interviews in lonely lodgings, of public gatherings at night of men and women, and of the kiss of peace. They insinuated that, after all, he was even such a one as themselves. So, in like manner, was the fair fame of a disciple of St. Paul's attacked by Martial, not apparently with malignity, but only in the wantonness of jest. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus on the Later. Years of St.</span> <span class= "ital">Paul's Life,</span> at the end of the Acts of the Apostles.) So like charges were levelled at the reputation of Athanasius (Sozomen. <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> ii. 25), and of Hooker (Walton's <span class= "ital">Life</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> So, generally, it was the ever-recurring calumny of the heathen against the Christians that their <span class= "ital">Agapae,</span> or Feasts of Love, were scenes of foulest license. It is obvious that there is much in the popular outcry against confession that partakes more or less of the same character. Against charges of this nature St. Paul utters his indignant denial: "No," he virtually says; "you find a place in your affections for those who do such things: can you not find a place also for us who are free from them<span class= "ital">?"</span> The sense which some have given to the word "corrupt," as referring only to doctrinal corruptions, is manifestly out of the question. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Receive us;</span> rather, <span class="accented">open your hearts to us</span>; <span class="accented">make room for us</span> (comp. <a href="/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>; <a href="/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>). It is an appeal to them to get rid of the <span class="accented">narrowness</span> of heart, the constricted affections, of which he has complained in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We have wronged... corrupted... defrauded no man.</span> The "no man" in the original is placed first, and this emphatic position, together with its triple repetition, marks St. Paul's insistence on the fact that, whatever his enemies might insinuate, there was no <span class="accented">single member</span> of their Church who could complain of injury, moral harm, or unfair treatment from him. Clearly he is again thinking of definite slanders against himself. His sternness to the offender may have been denounced as a wrong; his generous sanction of broad views about clean and unclean meats, idol-offerings, etc., may have been represented as corrupting others by false teaching (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>) or bad example (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>); his urgency about the collection for the saints (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-16.htm">2 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>), or his assertion of legitimate authority, may have been specified as greed for power. The verb <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> is often used in connection with other verbs, implying sensuality. It is difficult for us even to imagine that St. Paul had ever been charged with gross immorality; but it may have been so, for in a corrupt atmosphere everything is corrupt. Men like Nero and Heliogabalus, being themselves the vilest of men, openly declared their belief that no man was pure, and many in the heathen world may have been inclined to similar suspicions. Of Whitefield, the poet says - <p><span class="accented">"His sins were such as Sodom never knew,<br />And calumny stood up to swear all true."</span> We know too that the Christians were universally charged with Thyestean banquets and promiscuous licentiousness. It is, however, more natural to take <span class="accented">pleonektein</span> in its <span class="accented">general</span> sense, in which it means "to overreach," "to claim or seize more than one's just rights" (see <a href="/2_corinthians/2-11.htm">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>) In <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-6</a> he is defending himself against similar charges, as also in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 5:12; 6:3; 10:7-11; 11; 12.<span class="accented">, passim</span>). For similar strains of defence, see those of Moses and of Samuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Make room for us in your hearts.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#935;&#969;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Ch&#333;r&#275;sate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5562.htm">Strong's 5562: </a> </span><span class="str2">From chora; to be in space, i.e. to pass, enter, or to hold, admit.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">We have wronged</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#942;&#963;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;dik&#275;samen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_91.htm">Strong's 91: </a> </span><span class="str2">To act unjustly towards, injure, harm.
