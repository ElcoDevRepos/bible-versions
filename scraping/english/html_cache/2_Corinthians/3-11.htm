The glory associated with the Old Covenant is evident in the account of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, where his face shone with the glory of God (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>). This glory, however, was temporary and served as a foreshadowing of the greater glory to come. The fading nature of this glory symbolizes the temporary and preparatory role of the Law, which pointed to the need for a more permanent solution to humanity's sin problem. The Old Covenant was glorious in that it revealed God's holiness and moral standards, but it was not intended to be the final solution for salvation.<p><b>came with glory</b><br>The glory of the Old Covenant was manifested in various ways, such as the presence of God in the tabernacle and later the temple, the miracles performed during the Exodus, and the divine revelations given to the prophets. This glory was a testament to God's power and holiness, yet it was limited in its ability to transform the human heart. The Law served as a tutor to lead people to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), highlighting the need for a savior. The glory of the Old Covenant was real and significant, but it was ultimately a shadow of the greater glory found in the New Covenant.<p><b>how much greater is the glory of that which endures!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the superiority of the New Covenant, established through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Unlike the Old Covenant, the New Covenant is eternal and transformative, offering a permanent solution to sin through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The glory of the New Covenant is greater because it provides direct access to God, forgiveness of sins, and the promise of eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). The enduring nature of this glory is seen in the transformative power of the Gospel, which changes lives and brings believers into a personal relationship with God. The New Covenant fulfills the prophecies of the Old Testament, such as <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new heart and spirit for His people. This enduring glory is ultimately a reflection of the person and work of Jesus Christ, who is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His being (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth.
