In the early church, apostles like Paul were often unknown to the broader society, lacking fame or recognition in worldly terms. However, they were well-known within the Christian community and to God. This reflects the biblical theme that true recognition comes from God rather than human accolades (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). The apostles' work was often hidden from the public eye, yet their impact was profound and eternal. This duality is reminiscent of Jesus Christ, who was not recognized by many during His earthly ministry (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>), yet is the most well-known figure in Christianity.<p><b>dying, and yet we live on;</b><br>Paul frequently faced life-threatening situations (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>), and this phrase highlights the constant danger and persecution he endured. Despite these threats, Paul and his companions continued to live and serve, sustained by the power of God. This reflects the Christian belief in eternal life and the resurrection, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>, where the Spirit gives life to mortal bodies. The apostles' perseverance in the face of death mirrors the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, who conquered death and offers eternal life to believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<p><b>punished, yet not killed;</b><br>The apostles often faced punishment, such as beatings and imprisonment, for their faith and preaching (<a href="/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40, 16</a>:23). Despite these severe trials, they were not killed, which underscores God's protection and purpose for their lives. This resilience is a testament to God's sovereignty and the belief that He preserves His servants until their mission is complete (<a href="/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14-16</a>). The phrase also echoes the experience of Jesus, who was punished and crucified, yet rose from the dead, demonstrating victory over sin and death (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth, addressing the challenges and paradoxes of the Christian ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_corinthian_church.htm">The Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of this letter, they were dealing with internal conflicts and external pressures, requiring guidance and encouragement from Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christian_ministry.htm">Christian Ministry</a></b><br>The broader context of this passage, highlighting the trials and paradoxes faced by those who serve Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The suffering and challenges faced by early Christians, often leading to misunderstandings and misjudgments by society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_christian_identity.htm">The Paradox of Christian Identity</a></b><br>Christians may be "unknown" to the world, yet they are "well-known" to God.

Possibly, he had been spoken of as a man of "unknown" or obscure antecedents, and his answer to that taunt is, as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="For we write none other things to you, than what you read or acknowledge; and I trust you shall acknowledge even to the end;">2Corinthians 1:13-14</a>, that where he was known at all he was <span class= "ital">recognised</span> as being what indeed he was. He could show even to them, to some of them at least, whether it were not so. In "dying, and, behold, we live" we may trace a reference partly to the "sentence of death" which had, as it were, been passed upon him (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead:">2Corinthians 1:9</a>), partly to the malignant exultation with which that fact had been received, or was likely, he thought, to be received by those who hated him. We can picture them as saying, "His course will soon be over; he will not trouble us long;" and his answer to that imagined sneer is that he is still in full energy. What has befallen him has been a chastening and a discipline, but he is not yet, as they fondly thought, "killed" and delivered over unto death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As unknown;</span> literally, <span class="accented">as being ignored</span>; <span class="accented">as those whom no one cares to recognize</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And yet well known.</span> "And becoming fully recognized."
