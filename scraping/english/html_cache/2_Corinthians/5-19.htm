The concept of reconciliation implies a restoration of a broken relationship, which in this context refers to the relationship between God and humanity. The use of "the world" indicates the universal scope of God's redemptive plan, transcending ethnic and cultural boundaries. The phrase "in Christ" underscores the centrality of Jesus as the mediator of this reconciliation, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant who bears the iniquities of many. This reconciliation is not achieved through human effort but through the sacrificial work of Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, which emphasizes that while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.<p><b>not counting men&#8217;s trespasses against them</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the forgiveness of sins, a core tenet of Christian doctrine. The term "trespasses" refers to violations of God's law, which create a barrier between humanity and God. The idea of not counting these trespasses against people is rooted in the concept of grace, where God chooses to forgive and not hold sins against individuals. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/32.htm">Psalm 32:1-2</a>, where David speaks of the blessedness of the one whose transgressions are forgiven. Theologically, this is made possible through the atonement of Christ, who, according to <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, bore our sins in His body on the cross, allowing for the removal of the barrier of sin.<p><b>And He has committed to us the message of reconciliation</b><br>This phrase indicates the responsibility given to believers to share the gospel, often referred to as the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The "message of reconciliation" is the good news that through Christ, people can be restored to a right relationship with God. This task is not limited to the apostles but extends to all Christians, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, which describes believers as a royal priesthood tasked with declaring the praises of Him who called them out of darkness. The commitment of this message to believers underscores the participatory role of the church in God's redemptive plan, acting as ambassadors for Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>), tasked with spreading the message of peace and reconciliation to a world in need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who initiates reconciliation with humanity through Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The central figure through whom reconciliation is made possible; the mediator between God and humanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Represents all of humanity, indicating the universal scope of God's reconciling work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth and explaining the ministry of reconciliation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A city in ancient Greece where the church Paul is addressing is located, known for its diverse and often morally challenging environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_reconciliation.htm">Understanding Reconciliation</a></b><br>Reconciliation is a divine initiative where God, through Christ, restores a broken relationship with humanity.

The English rendering is tenable grammatically, but the position of the words in the original suggests the construction given above. He seems to emphasise the greatness of the redeeming work by pointing at once to its author and its extent. The structure is the same as the "was preaching" of <a href="/luke/4-44.htm" title="And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.">Luke 4:44</a>. All the English versions, however, from Wiclif downwards, adopt the same construction. Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva version translate, <span class= "ital">making agreement between the world and Himself</span> instead of "reconciling to Himself." The "world" is, of course, the world of men, the "all" of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-15.htm" title="And that he died for all, that they which live should not from now on live to themselves, but to him which died for them, and rose again.">2Corinthians 5:15</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not imputing their trespasses unto them . . .</span>--The two participial clauses that follow describe the result of the reconciling work. The first is that God no longer charges their transgressions against men: the pronouns being used in the third person plural, as being more individualising than the "world," and more appropriate than would have been the first person, which he had used in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;">2Corinthians 5:18</a>, and which he wanted, in its narrower extension, for the clause which was to follow. The word for "imputing," or <span class= "ital">reckoning,</span> is specially prominent in the Epistles of this period, occurring, though in very varied shades of meaning, eight times in this Epistle and nineteen times in that to the Romans. The difficulty of maintaining a logical coherence of this truth with that of a judgment according to works does not present itself to the Apostle's mind, and need not trouble us. (See Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2Corinthians 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</span>--Literally, to maintain the participial construction, <span class= "ital">placing with</span> (or <span class= "ital">in</span>)<span class= "ital"> us the word of reconciliation.</span> Tyndale gives "atonement" here, as in <a href="/romans/5-11.htm" title="And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.">Romans 5:11</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.</span> This and the many other passages of Scripture which always represent the atonement as the work of the blessed Trinity, and as being the result of the <span class="accented">love</span>, not of the <span class="accented">wrath</span>, of God, ought to have been a sufficient warning against the hideous extravagance of those <span class="accented">forensic</span> statements of the atonement which have disgraced almost a thousand years of theology (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>).
