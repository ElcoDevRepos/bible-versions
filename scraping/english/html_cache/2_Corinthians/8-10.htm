Here, he offers his opinion, which carries weight due to his role in the early church. The context is the collection for the Jerusalem church, a significant act of charity and unity among early Christians. Paul's approach is pastoral, aiming to encourage rather than command, reflecting the voluntary nature of Christian giving (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>Last year you were the first not only to give,</b><br>The Corinthians had previously shown eagerness in contributing to the collection for the saints in Jerusalem. This reference to their past generosity serves as both a commendation and a gentle reminder to complete what they started. The act of giving is a reflection of the grace of God working in them, aligning with the biblical principle that faith is demonstrated through works (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>but even to have such a desire.</b><br>The Corinthians' initial desire to give is highlighted as commendable. In biblical terms, the desire to do good is as important as the act itself, as it reflects the transformation of the heart by the Holy Spirit. This desire aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of the heart's intentions (<a href="/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>).

They had formed the purpose of giving, they had begun to lay by and to collect, before their rivals had started. They had, as it were, scored those two points in that game of honourable competition. It was "profitable for them" that he, as a by-stander watching the game, should give them a hint, so that they might not at last be ignominiously defeated. It is not easy to fix the exact limits of time indicated in the "year ago." The First Epistle was written about Easter. Then, after remaining at Ephesus for a while, there came the journey to Troas; then that to Macedonia; then the coming of Titus, bringing word that the Corinthians had acted on the command of <a href="/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1</a>. This would bring us to the autumn months; and St. Paul, reckoning, as a Jew would, the year as beginning with Tisri (September or October), might speak of what had taken place in April or May as done "last year," though there had not been an interval of twelve months.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And herein I give my advice</span>; <span class="accented">and in this matter I offer an opinion</span> (<span class="accented">only</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For this is expedient for you</span>.

The "to do" is in the aorist, the "to be willing" in the present. We should naturally have expected a reversed order, "not only to be willing, but also to put in action." There must be a strong touch of irony in the words, unless we interpret it to mean "not only to make the collection, but to be willing to add yet more to it." Perhaps in the "to be willing" lies the notion of "the cheerful giver," "the willing mind "(ch. 9:7; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A year ago;</span> rather, <span class="accented">since the previous year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> last year (ch. 9:2).
