This reflects his pastoral concern and the relational nature of his ministry. The apostle's travels to Corinth were significant, as Corinth was a major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and immorality. Paul had previously established the church there, and his visits were crucial for maintaining doctrinal purity and unity.<p><b>I may not need to be as bold</b><br>Paul's boldness refers to his apostolic authority and willingness to confront issues directly. His previous letters, particularly 1 Corinthians, show his readiness to address sin and division within the church. The boldness he refers to is not out of personal pride but a necessary stance to uphold the truth of the Gospel. This reflects the tension between grace and truth in pastoral leadership.<p><b>as I expect toward those who presume</b><br>Paul anticipates having to confront certain individuals who are causing trouble within the church. These individuals are likely false apostles or teachers who challenge Paul's authority and teachings. The term "presume" suggests arrogance and a lack of submission to apostolic authority, which was a common issue in the early church as seen in other epistles like Galatians and 1 Timothy.<p><b>that we live according to the flesh</b><br>The accusation that Paul and his companions live according to the flesh implies a misunderstanding or deliberate misrepresentation of their motives and actions. In biblical terms, living according to the flesh means being driven by sinful desires rather than the Spirit. Paul consistently teaches against this, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-9</a>, where he contrasts living by the Spirit with living by the flesh.
