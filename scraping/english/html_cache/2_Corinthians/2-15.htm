In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth, reminding them of their role as representatives of Christ. This aligns with the biblical theme of living for God's glory, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>, where believers are encouraged to do everything for the glory of God.<p><b>the sweet aroma of Christ</b><br>The imagery of a "sweet aroma" is reminiscent of Old Testament sacrificial offerings, such as those described in <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>, where sacrifices were a pleasing aroma to the Lord. This metaphor suggests that believers' lives, when lived in accordance with Christ's teachings, are pleasing to God. It also reflects the sacrificial nature of Christ's own life and death, which was the ultimate offering to God.<p><b>among those who are being saved</b><br>This phrase indicates the presence and influence of believers within the community of the saved. It suggests an ongoing process of salvation, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to work out their salvation with fear and trembling. The community of the saved is not static but dynamic, growing in faith and understanding.<p><b>and those who are perishing</b><br>Here, Paul acknowledges the dual response to the gospel message. The concept of "perishing" is a common theme in the New Testament, referring to those who reject the message of Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16-18</a>. This phrase underscores the reality of spiritual death for those outside of Christ, contrasting with the life offered to those who believe. The presence of believers serves as a testimony to both groups, highlighting the stark difference in their eternal destinies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and to defend his apostleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges, where Paul established a church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a diverse group of believers facing internal and external challenges.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to the message, representing the source of the "sweet aroma" that believers are to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_being_saved_and_those_perishing.htm">Those Being Saved and Those Perishing</a></b><br>Two groups of people who respond differently to the message of Christ, representing believers and non-believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_aroma_of_christ.htm">The Aroma of Christ</a></b><br>Believers are called to embody the character and love of Christ, becoming a "sweet aroma" to God.

Here the mind of the writer turns to the sterner, sadder side of the Roman triumph. Some who appeared in that triumph were <span class= "ital">on their way to deliverance,</span> some <span class= "ital">on their way to perish</span> (this is the exact rendering of the words translated <span class= "ital">saved</span> and <span class= "ital">lost</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and this also has its analogue in the triumph of Christ. He does not shrink from that thought. In his belief in the righteousness and mercy of Christ, he is content to leave the souls of all men to His judgment. He will not the less do his work as incense-bearer, and let the "sweet savour" of the knowledge of God be wafted through the words which it has been given him to utter. All things are for His glory, for His righteousness will be seen to have been working through all.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ.</span> The undeveloped metaphor involved in these words is that "we and our preaching diffuse to God's glory the knowledge of Christ which is as a sweet savour." The apostles are identified with their work; they were as the incense, crushed and burned, but diffusing everywhere a waft of perfume. St. Paul is still thinking of the incense burnt in the streets of Rome during a triumph - "Dabimusque Divis Tura benignis" (Horace, 'Od.,' 4:2.51) - though his expression recalls the "odour of a sweet smell," of <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a> (comp. <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>); see on this passage the excellent note of Bishop Wordsworth. <span class="cmt_word">In them that are saved, and in them that perish;</span> rather, <span class="accented">among those who are perishing and those who are being saved</span> (comp. <a href="/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>).
