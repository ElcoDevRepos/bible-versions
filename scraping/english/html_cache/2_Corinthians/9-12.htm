The term "ministry" (Greek: diakonia) implies a service or duty performed for others, reflecting the early church's commitment to communal support and charity. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized serving others (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The early church often engaged in acts of service, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a>, where deacons were appointed to ensure fair distribution of resources.<p><b>is not only supplying the needs of the saints</b><br>The "saints" here refers to the believers in Jerusalem who were experiencing financial hardship. The early church viewed itself as a family, and there was a strong emphasis on mutual support (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). This collection was a practical expression of unity and love within the body of Christ, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries. It also fulfilled the principle of bearing one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God</b><br>The act of giving not only meets physical needs but also results in spiritual blessings, as it leads to gratitude and worship. This reflects the biblical principle that generosity glorifies God (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>). The recipients' thanksgiving is directed towards God, acknowledging Him as the ultimate provider. This mirrors the Old Testament practice of offerings and sacrifices as acts of worship and gratitude (<a href="/leviticus/7-12.htm">Leviticus 7:12-15</a>). The overflowing nature of thanksgiving suggests a multiplication effect, where the initial act of giving results in widespread praise and acknowledgment of God's goodness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, writing to the church in Corinth to encourage generosity and service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and dynamic early Christian community in Greece.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the believers, particularly those in need, whom the Corinthian church is encouraged to support.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate recipient of thanksgiving and praise, as the source of all provision and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/service_of_ministry.htm">Service of Ministry</a></b><br>The act of giving and supporting others, which Paul emphasizes as a vital part of Christian life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dual_impact_of_ministry.htm">The Dual Impact of Ministry</a></b><br>The service of ministry meets practical needs and also leads to spiritual outcomes, such as thanksgiving to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_worship.htm">Generosity as Worship</a></b><br>Giving and supporting others is not just a duty but an act of worship that honors God and reflects His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_interdependence.htm">Community and Interdependence</a></b><br>The church is called to be a community where members support one another, demonstrating the love of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overflowing_thanksgiving.htm">Overflowing Thanksgiving</a></b><br>Acts of service and generosity lead to gratitude, both from those who receive and those who give, creating a cycle of praise to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_to_serve.htm">Encouragement to Serve</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to actively seek opportunities to serve and support others, knowing it pleases God and strengthens the church.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_9_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 9:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_9_12_How_to_meet_others_needs.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 9:12 encourage us to meet others' needs practically?

In classical Greek it stands for any public service rendered to the State. In the LXX. version it, and its cognate verb and adjective, are used almost exclusively of the ritual and sacrificial services of the Tabernacle and the Temple, as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="/numbers/4-25.htm" title="And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above on it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:25</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-30.htm" title="And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, men of valor, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in the service of the king.">1Chronicles 26:30</a>; and in this sense it appears in <a href="/luke/1-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-21.htm" title="Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.">Hebrews 9:21</a>; and with the same shade of meaning, used figuratively, in <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17</a>. That meaning survives in the ecclesiastical term "liturgy," applied, as it was at first, exclusively to the service of the celebration of the Lord's Supper. Here, probably, the thought is implied that a large and liberal gift to Christ's poor, and for His sake, is the most acceptable of all forms of "service" in the liturgical sense of that word. So understood it implies the same truth as that stated in <a href="/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the administration of this service.</span> The word "liturgy," here rendered "service," is used in the same connection in <a href="/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a>.
