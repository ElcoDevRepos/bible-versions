The Greek word for "affection" here can also be translated as "inward parts" or "compassion," indicating a profound, heartfelt bond. This reflects the biblical principle of love and unity within the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>, where Paul expresses similar feelings for the Philippians. The increase in affection suggests a positive change in the Corinthians' behavior, which is a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>when he remembers that you were all obedient</b><br>The Corinthians' obedience is a key theme in this passage. Their willingness to heed Paul's instructions and correct their previous errors is a significant aspect of their spiritual growth. Obedience in the New Testament is often linked to faith and love for God, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commands." The Corinthians' obedience would have been a source of encouragement for Titus and Paul, affirming the effectiveness of their ministry and the work of the Holy Spirit among the believers.<p><b>as you welcomed him with fear and trembling</b><br>The phrase "fear and trembling" is a biblical expression denoting reverence and humility. It is used in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>, to describe the attitude believers should have in their walk with God. In the cultural context of the Corinthian church, this phrase indicates the respect and seriousness with which they received Titus. It reflects a recognition of the authority of Paul's apostolic ministry and the message he brought. This attitude of reverence is essential for spiritual growth and aligns with the biblical call to approach God and His messengers with humility and respect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, addressing issues within the church and offering guidance and encouragement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A fellow worker and companion of Paul, who was sent to Corinth to observe and report back on the church's response to Paul's previous letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>- The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth dealing with internal challenges and moral issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>- A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral decadence, where Paul established a church during his missionary journeys.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_previous_letter.htm">Paul's Previous Letter</a></b><br>- Refers to the earlier correspondence from Paul to the Corinthians, addressing issues and calling for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_reverence.htm">Obedience and Reverence</a></b><br>The Corinthians' obedience and their reception of Titus with "fear and trembling" demonstrate the importance of respecting and honoring those who bring God's message.

The affection mentioned here is Titus&#8217;s deep, heartfelt love for the believers, love that swelled after witnessing their genuine response.<p>&#8226; Earlier Paul wrote, &#8220;For through many tears I wrote you&#8230; to let you know the depth of my love for you&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>). Now that same love is mirrored in Titus, confirming that the gospel produces real family bonds.<p>&#8226; Genuine Christian affection grows when believers see one another walking in truth (<a href="/3_john/1-3.htm">3 John 1:3&#8211;4</a>). Titus&#8217;s rising affection is proof that obedience and repentance warm the hearts of those who minister.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he remembers</b><p>&#8226; Memory fuels affection. Each recollection of Corinth&#8217;s change of heart rekindles joy in Titus, much like Paul&#8217;s own gratitude whenever he thought of the Philippians: &#8220;I thank my God every time I remember you&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Godly leaders treasure testimonies of spiritual growth. Paul told Timothy he longed to see him, &#8220;remembering your tears&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-4.htm">2 Timothy 1:4</a>). In the same way, Titus&#8217;s memories of Corinth are now soaked in encouragement rather than concern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You were all obedient</b><p>&#8226; The entire church responded; no pockets of resistance remained. Earlier, Paul had &#8220;written to test your obedience&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>). The test was passed, demonstrating that the Spirit&#8217;s work was thorough.<p>&#8226; Obedience is the expected fruit of faith. &#8220;Just as you have always obeyed&#8230; continue to work out your salvation&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>). Their collective submission validated Paul&#8217;s authority and upheld the gospel&#8217;s honor (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As you welcomed him with fear and trembling</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fear and trembling&#8221; is not cringing terror but reverent seriousness. Slaves are told to obey &#8220;with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>). The Corinthians received Titus with that same God-focused respect.<p>&#8226; Their reception echoed Cornelius&#8217;s words to Peter: &#8220;Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-33.htm">Acts 10:33</a>). Such humility shows that the believers understood Titus was a messenger of God, not just Paul&#8217;s assistant.<p>&#8226; The posture of fear and trembling keeps the church teachable and shields it from pride (<a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>). It is precisely this humble stance that intensified Titus&#8217;s affection; respect invites love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Titus returned to Paul brimming with love for the Corinthian church because every memory he had was of their unified, humble obedience. They listened, repented, and embraced him with reverent seriousness. Their response proved the authenticity of their faith, satisfied Paul&#8217;s pastoral heart, and strengthened the bonds of Christian fellowship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">His inward affection.</span>--The margin gives the literal meaning of the Greek, which is used here with the same meaning as in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2Corinthians 6:12</a>.
