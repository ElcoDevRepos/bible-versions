The term "in Christ" is a key Pauline concept, signifying a deep, spiritual union with Jesus. This union is not limited by ethnicity, social status, or past sins, reflecting the inclusive nature of the Gospel (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The phrase "in Christ" also implies a position of security and identity, as believers are seen as part of the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>).<p><b>he is a new creation</b><br>The concept of being a "new creation" is rooted in the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. This transformation is not merely a moral or ethical change but a fundamental renewal of one's nature (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). The idea of new creation echoes the Genesis account, where God created the world, signifying that believers are part of a new order inaugurated by Christ's resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). This transformation is both immediate and ongoing, as believers grow in sanctification.<p><b>The old has passed away</b><br>This phrase indicates a definitive break from the past life of sin and separation from God. The "old" refers to the former way of living, characterized by sin and spiritual death (<a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>). The passing away of the old is akin to the death of the old self, as described in <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>, where believers are called to put off the old nature and its practices (<a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9-10</a>). This is a call to repentance and a turning away from former sinful behaviors.<p><b>Behold, the new has come!</b><br>The use of "behold" serves as an exclamation, drawing attention to the miraculous nature of the transformation. The "new" signifies the new life and identity found in Christ, marked by righteousness and holiness (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>). This newness is a present reality and a foretaste of the ultimate renewal of all creation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>. The new life in Christ is characterized by the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and a renewed purpose to live for God's glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is writing to the church in Corinth to address various issues and to encourage them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinth.htm">Corinth</a></b><br>A major city in ancient Greece, known for its wealth and moral challenges.

The old things of his life, Jewish expectations of a Jewish kingdom, chiliastic dreams, heathen philosophies, lower aims, earthly standards--these things, in idea at least, passed away from him at the time when he was united with Christ.

If even a human, personal, external knowledge of Christ is henceforth of no significance, it follows that there must have been a total change in all relations towards him.
