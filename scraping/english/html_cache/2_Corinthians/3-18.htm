The veil symbolizes the old covenant and the spiritual blindness of those who do not accept Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14-16</a>). The "unveiled faces" indicate openness and direct access to God through Jesus, emphasizing the removal of barriers between God and humanity.<p><b>all reflect the glory of the Lord</b><br>Believers are called to reflect God's glory, akin to how Moses' face shone after being in God's presence. This reflection is not just a passive display but an active participation in God's divine nature (<a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>). The glory of the Lord is His divine presence and holiness, which believers are to mirror in their lives, showcasing the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>are being transformed into His image</b><br>This transformation is a process of sanctification, where believers are gradually conformed to the likeness of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). It is a spiritual metamorphosis that involves the renewal of the mind and heart (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). This transformation is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers grow in holiness and Christlikeness.<p><b>with intensifying glory</b><br>The phrase suggests a progressive increase in the believer's reflection of God's glory. This intensification is a continual process, indicating that the Christian life is dynamic and ever-growing. It points to the ultimate glorification that believers will experience in eternity (1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), where they will fully share in Christ's glory.<p><b>which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit</b><br>The source of this transformation and glory is the Lord, specifically identified as the Spirit. This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life, empowering and enabling them to reflect God's glory (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The Spirit is the agent of change, working within believers to produce spiritual fruit and guide them into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).

"We," says the Apostle, after the parenthesis of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm" title="Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.">2Corinthians 3:17</a>, "are free, and therefore we have no need to cover our faces, as slaves do before the presence of a great king. There is no veil over our hearts, and therefore none over the eyes with which we exercise our faculty of spiritual vision. We are as Moses was when he stood before the Lord with the veil withdrawn." If the <span class= "ital">Tallith</span> were in use at this time in the synagogues of the Jews, there might also be a reference to the contrast between that ceremonial usage and the practice of Christian assemblies. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a>; but see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord.</span>--The Greek participle which answers to the first five words belongs to a verb derived from the Greek for "mirror" (identical in meaning, though not in form, with that of <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>). The word is not a common word, and St. Paul obviously had some special reason for choosing it, instead of the more familiar words, "seeing," "beholding," "gazing stedfastly;" and it is accordingly important to ascertain its meaning. There is no doubt that the active voice signifies to "make a reflection in a mirror." There is as little doubt that the middle voice signifies to look at one's self in a mirror. Thus Socrates advised drunkards and the young to "look at themselves in a mirror," that they might learn the disturbing effects of passion (<span class= "ital">Diog. Laert.</span> ii. 33; iii. 39). This meaning, however, is inapplicable here; and the writings of Philo, who in one passage (<span class= "ital">de Migr. Abrah.</span> p. 403) uses it in this sense of the priests who saw their faces in the polished brass of the lavers of purification, supply an instance of its use with a more appropriate meaning. Paraphrasing the prayer of Moses in <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>, he makes him say: "Let me not <span class= "ital">behold</span> Thy form (<span class= "ital">idea</span>)<span class= "ital"> mirrored</span> (using the very word which we find here) in any created thing, but in Thee, the very God" (2 <span class= "ital">Allegor.</span> p. 79). And this is obviously the force of the word here. The sequence of thought is, it is believed, this:--St. Paul was about to contrast the veiled vision of Israel with the unveiled gaze of the disciples of Christ; but he remembers what he had said in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a> as to the limitation of our present knowledge, and therefore, instead of using the more common word, which would convey the thought of a fuller knowledge, falls back upon the unusual word, which exactly expresses the same thought as that passage had expressed. "We behold the glory of the Lord, of the Jehovah of the Old Testament, but it is not, as yet, face to face, but as mirrored in the person of Christ." The following words, however, show that the word suggested yet another thought to him. When we see the sun as reflected in a polished mirror of brass or silver, the light illumines us: we are, as it were, transfigured by it and reflect its brightness. That this meaning lies in the word itself cannot, it is true, be proved, and it is, perhaps, hardly compatible with the other meaning which we have assigned to it; but it is perfectly conceivable that the word should suggest the fact, and the fact be looked on as a parable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But we all.</span> An appeal to personal experience in evidence of the freedom. <span class="cmt_word">With open face;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with unveiled face</span>; as Moses himself spoke with God, whereas the Jews could not see even the <span class="accented">reflected</span> splendour on the face of Moses till he had shrouded it with a veil. <span class="cmt_word">Beholding as in a glass.</span> This is <span class="accented">at least</span> as likely to be the true meaning as "reflecting as a mirror," which the Revised Version (following Chrysostom and others) has substituted for it. No other instance occurs in which the verb in the middle voice has the meaning of "reflecting," and the words, "With unveiled face," imply the image of "beholding." They are, in fact, a description of "the beatific vision." An additional reason for retaining the translation of our Authorized Version is that the verb is used in <span class="accented">this</span> sense by Philo ('Leg. Alleg.,' 3:33). <span class="cmt_word">The glory of the Lord.</span> Namely, him who is "the Effulgence of God's glory" (<a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), the true Shechinah, "the Image of the invisible God" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are changed into the same image.</span> The present tense implies a <span class="accented">gradual</span> transfiguration, a mystical and spiritual change which is produced in us while we contemplate Christ. <span class="cmt_word">From glory to glory.</span> Our spiritual assimilation to Christ comes <span class="accented">from</span> his glory and issues in a glory like his (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; comp." from strength to strength," <a href="/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a>). (For the thought, comp. <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.) As by the Spirit of the Lord. This rendering (which is that of the Vulgate also) can hardly be correct. The natural meaning of the Greek is "as <span class="accented">by the</span> [or, <span class="accented">from</span>] <span class="accented">the Lord the Spirit</span>." <span class="accented">Our</span> change into glory comes from the Lord, who, as St. Paul has already explained, is the Spirit of which he has been speaking. No such abstract theological thought is here in his mind as that of the "<span class="accented">hypostatic</span> union," of the Son and the Holy Spirit. He is still referring to the contrast between the letter and the spirit, and his identification of this "spirit" in its highest sense with the quickening life which, by the gift of the Holy Spirit, we receive from Christ, and which is indeed identical with "the Spirit of Christ." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we, [who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
