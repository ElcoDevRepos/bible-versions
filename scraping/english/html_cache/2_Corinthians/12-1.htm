In the context of 2 Corinthians, Paul reluctantly engages in boasting to counteract the influence of these false teachers. This phrase highlights the tension between humility and the necessity to assert his apostolic authority. The cultural context of Corinth, a city known for its love of rhetoric and public speaking, makes this boasting a strategic move to connect with the audience on their terms.<p><b>Although there is nothing to gain,</b><br>Paul acknowledges that boasting is not spiritually beneficial. This reflects the biblical principle that true worth is found in humility and service, as seen in Jesus' teachings (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). Paul&#8217;s admission underscores the futility of human pride and the importance of focusing on spiritual growth and the edification of the church rather than personal accolades.<p><b>I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</b><br>Paul transitions to discussing his spiritual experiences, which serve as evidence of his genuine apostolic calling. Visions and revelations were common ways God communicated with His prophets and apostles, as seen in the experiences of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9-20</a>). This phrase indicates that Paul's authority is divinely sanctioned, not self-appointed. The mention of "the Lord" emphasizes the source of these revelations, aligning with the biblical theme that true prophecy and revelation come from God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.

His aim is the church&#8217;s protection, much like his previous defense in <a href="/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a> where he boasts only &#8220;in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Although there is nothing to gain</b><p>&#8220; Although there is nothing to gain &#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>b)<p>&#8226; Spiritual profit never comes from self-exaltation (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>).

It is not, indeed, expedient, but</span> <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">will come</span> . . . The sequence of thought would seem to be that the Apostle felt constrained by the taunts of his opponents to indulge in what looked like self-assertion in vindication of his own character; that he was conscious, as he did so, that it was not, in the highest sense of the word, expedient for him; and that, under the influence of these mingled feelings, he passed over other topics on which he might have dwelt, and came at once to that which had been made matter of reproach against him.<p><span class= "bld">Visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>--It need scarcely be said that the history of the Acts is full of such visions (<a href="/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-6</a>; <a href="/acts/16-9.htm" title="And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm" title="Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace:">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="/acts/22-18.htm" title="And saw him saying to me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.">Acts 22:18</a>; <a href="/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>; <a href="/acts/27-23.htm" title="For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,">Acts 27:23</a>). One other instance is referred to in <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>. There is scarcely any room for doubt that this also had been made matter of reproach against him, and perhaps urged as a proof of the charge of madness. In the Clementine <span class= "ital">Homilies</span>--a kind of controversial romance representing the later views of the Ebionite or Judaising party, in which most recent critics have recognised a thinly-veiled attempt to present the characteristic features of St. Paul under the pretence of an attack on Simon Magus, just as the writer of a political novel in modern times might draw the portraits of his rivals under fictitious names--we find stress laid on the alleged claims of Simon to have had communications from the Lord through visions and dreams and outward revelations; and this claim is contrasted with that of Peter, who had personally followed Christ during his ministry on earth (<span class= "ital">Hom.</span> xvii. 14-20). What was said then, in the form of this elaborate attack, may well have been said before by the more malignant advocates of the same party. The charge of insanity was one easy to make, and of all charges, perhaps, the most difficult to refute by one who gloried in the facts which were alleged as its foundation--who did see visions, and did "speak with tongues" in the ecstasy of adoring rapture (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-18.htm" title="I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:">1Corinthians 14:18</a>). It may be noted as an instance of St. Luke's fairness that he, ignorant of, or ignoring, the charge of madness that had been brought against St. Paul, does not grudge the Apostle of the Circumcision whatever glory might accrue from a true revelation thus made through the medium of a vision (<a href="/context/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10-11</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.</span> This rendering follows the best-attested reading; but it is at least doubtful whether, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, the ironic <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f74;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39a;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;</span>, and the Greek Fathers is not the true reading.

In that case it is hardly possible to define the counter currents of feeling which caused the use of the conjunction. <span class="cmt_word">Visions and revelations.</span> The word used for "visions" means presentations perceived in a state which is neither sleeping nor waking, but which are regarded as objective; "revelations" are the truths apprehended as a result of the visions. <span class="accented">Optasia</span>, for "visions," only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; <a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a> (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I must</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(dei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third person singular active present of deo; also deon deh-on'; neuter active participle of the same; both used impersonally; it is Necessary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go on boasting.</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#965;&#967;&#8118;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Kauchasthai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Infinitive Middle or Passive<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2744.htm">Strong's 2744: </a> </span><span class="str2">To boast; I glory (exult) proudly.
