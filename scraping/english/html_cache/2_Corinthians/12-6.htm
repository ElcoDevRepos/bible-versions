In the Greco-Roman world, boasting was often associated with honor and status. However, Paul contrasts worldly boasting with the Christian virtue of humility. In <a href="/2_corinthians/11-16.htm">2 Corinthians 11:16-18</a>, Paul discusses boasting as a "fool's" activity, yet he distinguishes his potential boasting as truthful, unlike the false apostles who boasted in their own achievements.<p><b>because I would be speaking the truth.</b><br>Paul emphasizes that his potential boasting would be based on truth, not exaggeration or deceit. This aligns with his commitment to integrity and transparency in his ministry (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>). The truth he refers to likely includes his visions and revelations from the Lord, as mentioned earlier in the chapter (<a href="/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</a>). This truth is not self-aggrandizing but rather a testament to God's work in his life.<p><b>But I refrain,</b><br>Paul chooses to refrain from boasting, demonstrating self-control and prioritizing the edification of the church over personal glory. This restraint reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized humility and servanthood (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). Paul's decision to refrain is also a strategic choice to avoid giving his opponents any reason to accuse him of self-promotion.<p><b>so no one will credit me with more than he sees in me or hears from me,</b><br>Paul desires that his reputation be based solely on his observable actions and spoken words, not on any exaggerated claims. This reflects a principle of authenticity and accountability in Christian leadership. In <a href="/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>, Paul emphasizes the importance of demonstrating the Spirit's power rather than relying on persuasive words. By focusing on what others can see and hear, Paul ensures that his ministry remains grounded in reality and accessible to all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the church in Corinth.
