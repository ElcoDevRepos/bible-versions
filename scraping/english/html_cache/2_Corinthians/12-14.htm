His previous visits, as recorded in <a href="/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16</a>, were foundational in establishing and nurturing the Corinthian church. This third visit underscores the importance of personal presence in ministry, reflecting the apostolic model of direct engagement with church communities.<p><b>and I will not be a burden</b><br>Paul emphasizes his intention not to be financially burdensome to the Corinthians. This reflects his practice of self-support through tent-making (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>) and his desire to avoid any accusation of exploiting the church. It also aligns with his teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>, where he speaks of preaching the gospel free of charge to avoid hindering its message.<p><b>because I am not seeking your possessions, but you</b><br>Paul's focus is on the spiritual well-being of the Corinthians rather than material gain. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. Paul's pastoral heart is evident as he prioritizes the spiritual growth and maturity of the believers over any personal benefit.<p><b>For children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children</b><br>This analogy draws from the natural familial responsibility where parents provide for their children. In a spiritual sense, Paul sees himself as a spiritual father to the Corinthians (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>), responsible for their growth and well-being. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and care, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, where a good person leaves an inheritance for their children's children.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, who is expressing his intent to visit the Corinthian church for the third time.
