The term "age" suggests a limited period, indicating that Satan's influence is temporary and subject to God's ultimate authority. In the cultural context of the time, many believed in various deities, but Paul emphasizes that there is one true God, contrasting with the false "god" who deceives.<p><b>has blinded the minds of unbelievers</b><br>The blinding of minds signifies a spiritual blindness, preventing people from understanding and accepting the truth of the gospel. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not understand. The historical context shows that many in Corinth were influenced by Greek philosophy and pagan religions, which could contribute to their spiritual blindness.<p><b>so they cannot see the light of the gospel</b><br>The "light" symbolizes truth and revelation, a common biblical metaphor (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). The gospel is portrayed as a light that dispels darkness, offering salvation and understanding. The inability to see this light indicates a lack of spiritual insight and acceptance, often due to the influence of sin and deception.<p><b>of the glory of Christ</b><br>The glory of Christ refers to His divine nature and the revelation of God's presence through Him. This connects to the transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>) and the resurrection, where Christ's glory was revealed. In Jewish tradition, glory is associated with God's presence, as seen in the Shekinah glory in the temple.<p><b>who is the image of God</b><br>Christ as the image of God highlights His divine nature and role as the perfect representation of God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). This concept is rooted in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where humans are made in God's image, but Christ is the ultimate fulfillment of this, being fully divine and fully human.

The world which "lieth in wickedness," perhaps <span class= "ital">in the evil one</span> (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm" title="And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.">1John 5:19</a>), worships the spirit of hate and falsehood and selfishness, and in so doing it practically deifies the devil. And the work of that god of this world is directly in antagonism to that of God. He seeks to lead men back from light to darkness. "<span class= "ital">He blinded</span>" (the Greek tense indicates an act in past time without necessarily including the idea of its continuance in the present) "the minds of the <span class= "ital">unbelievers."</span> The noun is probably used, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.">1Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12-15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-27.htm" title="If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.">1Corinthians 10:27</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/14-22.htm" title="Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.">1Corinthians 14:22-24</a>, with a special reference to the outside heathen world. Their spiritual state was, St. Paul seems to say, lower than that of Israel. The veil was over the heart of the one; the very organs of spiritual perception were blinded in the other. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The god of this world;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the god of this age</span>. It is, as Bengel says, "a great and horrible description of the devil." He is not, however, here called a god of the kosmos, but only of the <span class="accented">olam hazzeh</span>, the present dispensation of things as it exists among those who refuse to enter that kingdom in which the power of Satan is brought to nought. The melancholy attempt to get rid of Manichean arguments by rendering the verse "in whom God blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers of this world" is set aside by the fact that the terrible description of Satan as "another god" (<span class="accented">El acheer</span>) was common among the rabbis. They knew that his power was indeed a derivative power, trot still that it was permitted to be great (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). In <a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a> (John 14:30) our Lord speaks of him as "the ruler of the kosmos." <span class="cmt_word">Hath blinded;</span> rather, <span class="accented">blinded</span>. The verb here has no other meaning than "to blind," and is quite different from the verb "to harden," rendered by "to blind" in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a> with the same substantive. They are blind from lack of faith, and so being "unbelieving" they are" perishing" (<a href="/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>), seeing that they "walk in darkness" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>) and are in Satan's power (<a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>). Blindness of heart," says St. Augustine, "is both a sin and a punishment of sin and a cause of sin." <span class="cmt_word">The light of the glorious gospel of Christ</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the illumination of the gospel of the glory of the Christ</span>. The word <span class="accented">photismos</span> in later ecclesiastical Greek was used for "baptism." <span class="cmt_word">Who is the image of God</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Should shine unto them;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">should dawn upon them</span>. The other rendering, "that they should not <span class="accented">see</span> the illumination," gives to the verb <span class="accented">augazo</span>, a rarer sense, only found in poetry, and not known to the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
