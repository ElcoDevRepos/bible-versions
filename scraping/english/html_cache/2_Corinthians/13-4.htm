The crucifixion was a method of execution reserved for the most severe criminals, emphasizing the humiliation and vulnerability Christ endured. This weakness is not a lack of divine power but a voluntary submission to fulfill God's redemptive plan (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). The crucifixion took place outside Jerusalem, at a site known as Golgotha, which holds significant archaeological and historical importance as the place of Jesus' sacrifice.<p><b>yet He lives by God&#8217;s power</b><br>Despite the weakness of the crucifixion, Christ's resurrection demonstrates the power of God. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). This power is the same divine force that raised Jesus from the dead, signifying God's ultimate authority and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>).<p><b>For we are also weak in Him</b><br>Believers share in Christ's weakness through their identification with Him. This weakness can refer to human limitations, suffering, and the trials faced in the Christian life. Paul often speaks of his own weaknesses to highlight the sufficiency of God's grace (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>). This identification with Christ's weakness is part of the believer's journey, reflecting the paradox of strength through weakness.<p><b>yet by God&#8217;s power we will live with Him</b><br>Just as Christ was raised by God's power, believers are promised new life through the same divine power. This assurance of life is both present and future, encompassing spiritual renewal and the hope of resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>). The power of God enables believers to overcome spiritual challenges and live victoriously in Christ, pointing to the transformative work of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>concerning you</b><br>Paul's statement is directed towards the Corinthian church, emphasizing the communal aspect of this promise. The apostle assures the Corinthians that they, too, will experience God's power in their lives. This reflects the broader New Testament theme of the church as the body of Christ, where believers are united in Him and share in His life and mission (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>).

For He too lived encompassed with the infirmities of man's nature, and the possibility of the crucifixion flowed from that fact, as a natural sequel.<p><span class= "bld">For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him.</span>--The thought that underlies the apparently hard saying is that the disciples of Christ share at once in their Lord's weakness and in His strength. "We, too, are weak," the Apostle says; "we have our share in infirmities and sufferings, which are ennobled by the thought that they are ours because we are His; but we know that we shall live in the highest sense, in the activities of the spiritual life, which also we share with Him, and which comes to us by the power of God; and this life will be manifested in the exercise of our spiritual power towards you and for your good." To refer the words "we shall live" to the future life of the resurrection, though the thought is, of course, true in itself, is to miss the special force of the words in relation to the context.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For though.</span> The "though" should be omitted. <span class="cmt_word">Through weakness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">out of weakness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of that human weakness of our nature which he took upon him, and which rendered him liable to agony and death (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But we shall live with him... toward you.</span> This thought of participation alike in Christ's humiliation and his glory, alike in his weakness and his might, was very familiar to St. Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>), Here, however, the following words," toward you," <span class="accented">i.e."</span> with reference to you," show that the life of which he is thinking is the vigorous reestablishment of his spiritual authority in Christ over the Church of Corinth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
