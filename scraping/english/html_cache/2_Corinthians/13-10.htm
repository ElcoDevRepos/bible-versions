His absence allowed him to communicate thoughtfully and prevent immediate emotional reactions. This approach reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>, where the righteous ponder their answers. Writing from a distance also allowed Paul to address multiple issues comprehensively, as seen in his other epistles.<p><b>so that when I am present I will not need to be severe</b><br>Paul's intention was to avoid harshness when he visited the Corinthian church. His desire to be gentle aligns with the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The severity he refers to could involve church discipline, which he discusses in <a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>. His approach reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a> on resolving conflicts within the church.<p><b>in my use of the authority that the Lord gave me</b><br>Paul's authority as an apostle was divinely appointed, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>. This authority was not self-proclaimed but recognized by other apostles and church leaders, as evidenced in <a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>. His role was to guide and correct the church, similar to the Old Testament prophets who spoke with God's authority.<p><b>for building you up, not for tearing you down</b><br>Paul's mission was to edify the church, a theme consistent throughout his letters (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>). The imagery of building up is reminiscent of the construction of the temple, a place of God's presence, as described in <a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6</a>. This constructive purpose contrasts with the destructive nature of false teachings, which Paul warns against in <a href="/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a>. His focus on edification reflects Christ's ministry, who came to save and not to condemn (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, addressing the church in Corinth.
