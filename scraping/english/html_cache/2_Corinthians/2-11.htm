In the broader context of 2 Corinthians, Paul is addressing the issue of forgiveness and reconciliation within the church. By forgiving and restoring a repentant sinner, the church prevents Satan from exploiting the situation to sow discord and division. The concept of Satan as a deceiver is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, where he deceives Eve, and in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where believers are warned to be sober-minded and watchful because the devil prowls like a roaring lion. The term "outwit" suggests a strategic battle, emphasizing the need for spiritual discernment and unity in the body of Christ to resist the devil's schemes.<p><b>For we are not unaware of his schemes.</b><br>Paul asserts the importance of being knowledgeable about the enemy's strategies. The Greek word for "schemes" (noemata) implies cunning plans or thoughts, indicating that Satan's methods are often subtle and deceptive. This awareness is crucial for the church to stand firm against spiritual attacks. <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-12</a> further elaborates on this by urging believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes, highlighting the spiritual nature of the battle. Historically, the early church faced numerous challenges, both internal and external, and Paul's letters often addressed these issues to strengthen and guide the believers. Understanding Satan's schemes involves recognizing his attempts to undermine faith, promote false teachings, and create disunity. This knowledge equips Christians to remain steadfast in their faith and to support one another in love and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of 2 Corinthians, addressing the church in Corinth with pastoral concern and apostolic authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_corinth.htm">The Church in Corinth</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a diverse and often troubled congregation in a major Greek city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary, whose schemes Paul warns the Corinthians to be aware of.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_reconciliation.htm">Forgiveness and Reconciliation</a></b><br>The context of the passage, where Paul discusses the importance of forgiving a repentant sinner to prevent Satan from gaining an advantage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offender.htm">The Offender</a></b><br>A member of the Corinthian church who had caused grief, likely the same individual mentioned in <a href="/bsb/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>, who is now repentant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_spiritual_warfare.htm">Awareness of Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Christians must be vigilant and discerning, recognizing that Satan actively seeks to disrupt and deceive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_forgiveness.htm">The Importance of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Unforgiveness can be a foothold for Satan.
