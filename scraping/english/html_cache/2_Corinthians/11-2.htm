This jealousy is not rooted in selfishness but in a desire for their spiritual purity and faithfulness. In the Old Testament, God&#8217;s jealousy is often linked to His covenant relationship with Israel, where He desires exclusive devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). Paul&#8217;s use of "godly jealousy" underscores his role as a spiritual father to the Corinthians, emphasizing his commitment to their spiritual well-being and fidelity to the gospel.<p><b>For I promised you to one husband,</b><br>Paul uses the metaphor of betrothal to illustrate the relationship between the church and Christ. In ancient Jewish culture, betrothal was a binding agreement, more significant than modern engagements, often requiring a formal divorce to break. This reflects the seriousness of the commitment between the believers and Christ. The imagery of the church as the bride and Christ as the bridegroom is prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>), highlighting the intimate and covenantal nature of this relationship.<p><b>to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</b><br>The concept of presenting the church as a "pure virgin" emphasizes spiritual purity and holiness. In the cultural context of Corinth, known for its immorality, this imagery would have been particularly striking. Paul&#8217;s goal is to ensure that the church remains untainted by false teachings and worldly influences, maintaining their devotion to Christ. This presentation echoes the eschatological hope found in Revelation, where the church is depicted as a bride adorned for her husband (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The purity of the church is a reflection of Christ&#8217;s redemptive work, sanctifying and cleansing His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, expressing his deep concern and protective love for the church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/corinthian_church.htm">Corinthian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Corinth that Paul had founded and nurtured.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The bridegroom to whom the church is promised, representing the ultimate spiritual union.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/godly_jealousy.htm">Godly Jealousy</a></b><br>A term used by Paul to describe his fervent desire to protect the spiritual purity of the church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_imagery.htm">Marriage Imagery</a></b><br>The metaphor of the church as a bride promised to Christ, emphasizing purity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_godly_jealousy.htm">Understanding Godly Jealousy</a></b><br>Godly jealousy is protective and seeks the best for others, unlike human jealousy, which can be selfish and destructive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_as_the_bride_of_christ.htm">The Church as the Bride of Christ</a></b><br>The church is called to maintain spiritual purity and faithfulness, reflecting the commitment expected in a marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_spiritual_leaders.htm">The Role of Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Like Paul, spiritual leaders are tasked with guiding and protecting their congregations, ensuring they remain faithful to Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_christ.htm">Commitment to Christ</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to view their relationship with Christ as a sacred commitment, akin to a marriage covenant.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_holiness.htm">Pursuing Holiness</a></b><br>The imagery of a pure virgin highlights the importance of holiness and sanctification in the believer&#8217;s life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Corinthians_11_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Corinthians 11:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Cor_11_2_shows_Paul_s_dedication.htm">How does 2 Corinthians 11:2 illustrate Paul's commitment to the Corinthian church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_betrothed_to_one_husband.htm">What does "betrothed you to one husband" signify in a Christian's spiritual life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_keep_pure_devotion_to_Christ.htm">How can we maintain "pure devotion to Christ" in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Eph_5_25-27_2_Cor_11_2_relate.htm">In what ways does Ephesians 5:25-27 connect with 2 Corinthians 11:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Emulate_Paul_s_zeal_for_faith.htm">How can church leaders emulate Paul's protective zeal for their congregation's faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_promised_to_one_husband.htm">What does "I promised you to one husband, to Christ" mean in 2 Corinthians 11:2?

His &#8220;jealousy&#8221; is protective love, not envy. Like Moses breaking the tablets when Israel turned to the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>), Paul&#8217;s heart burns when he sees the Corinthians flirting with false teachers (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3&#8211;4</a>). This zeal reflects God&#8217;s own character&#8212;He guards what is His with uncompromising devotion (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a godly jealousy</b><p>Unlike sinful human jealousy, &#8220;godly jealousy&#8221; mirrors the Lord&#8217;s holy passion for His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; It insists on exclusive loyalty&#8212;no rivals, no syncretism (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; It seeks the other&#8217;s highest good, pushing back anything that harms their relationship with Christ (<a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It is rooted in covenant love; breaking that bond wounds both parties (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I promised you to one husband</b><p>Paul pictures himself as the matchmaker who has formally betrothed the Corinthian church to Jesus. In ancient betrothal, the commitment was legally binding; unfaithfulness was adultery (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18&#8211;19</a>). By preaching the gospel, Paul pledged them to Christ alone, not to competing philosophies or personalities (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12&#8211;13</a>). The church&#8217;s identity is that of a bride awaiting her wedding day (<a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to present you as a pure virgin to Christ</b><p>The goal is spotless purity&#8212;moral, doctrinal, and relational.<p>&#8226; Moral purity: turning from the world&#8217;s defilements (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Doctrinal purity: refusing any teaching that dilutes grace or denies Christ&#8217;s deity (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Relational purity: maintaining undivided devotion to the Lord (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>).<p>Paul echoes the future presentation of the church, &#8220;holy and blameless&#8221; before Him (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25&#8211;27</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). Revelation views this moment as a wedding celebration, with righteous acts as bright linen (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7&#8211;8</a>).

There is probably an implied contrast between the true jealousy which thus worked in his soul and the false jealousy of which he speaks in the passage just referred to.<p><span class= "bld">For I have espoused you . . .</span>--The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. It appears in this sense in the LXX. version of <a href="/proverbs/19-14.htm" title="House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.">Proverbs 19:14</a> : "A man's wife is espoused to him from the Lord." Strictly speaking, it is used of the act of the father who gives his daughter in marriage; and this, rather than the claim to act as "the friend of the bridegroom" (see Note on <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>), is probably the idea here. He claims the office as the "father" of the Corinthian Church (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1Corinthians 4:15</a>). The underlying idea of the comparison is that the Church at large, and every separate portion of it, is as the bride of Christ. On the earlier appearances of this thought, see Notes on <a href="/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>; <a href="/john/3-29.htm" title="He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.">John 3:29</a>; and, for its more elaborated forms, on <a href="/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9</a>). What the Apostle now urges is that it is as natural for him to be jealous for the purity of the Church which owes its birth to him, as it is for a father to be jealous over the chastity of the daughter whom he has betrothed as to a kingly bridegroom. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.
