Despite the hardships, Paul emphasizes perseverance and hope. The use of "therefore" connects this statement to the previous verses where Paul discusses the light of the gospel and the power of God sustaining them. This reflects a common biblical theme of enduring faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>, where believers are encouraged not to grow weary or lose heart.<p><b>Though our outer self is wasting away,</b><br>Paul acknowledges the physical decline and suffering that come with life and ministry. This reflects the human condition post-Fall, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where mortality and decay entered the world. The "outer self" refers to the physical body, which is subject to aging, illness, and persecution. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of the temporary nature of earthly life, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1-7</a>, which poetically describes the aging process.<p><b>yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.</b><br>In contrast to the physical decline, Paul speaks of a spiritual renewal that occurs continually. This renewal is a work of the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, where the Spirit regenerates and renews believers. The "inner self" refers to the spiritual aspect of a person, which grows stronger through faith and communion with God. This daily renewal is a process of sanctification, aligning with <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which calls believers to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This phrase underscores the hope and strength found in a relationship with Christ, who is the source of spiritual life and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14-15</a>). Because God &#8220;raised the Lord Jesus&#8221; and &#8220;will also raise us,&#8221; everything that happens to us serves a larger, eternal purpose. &#8226; This outlook mirrors <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where God works all things for good. &#8226; It echoes <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-5</a>, where a &#8220;living hope&#8221; steadies believers in trials. The &#8220;therefore&#8221; invites us to view our circumstances through the unshakable certainty of future glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we do not lose heart</b><p>&#8220;So we do not lose heart&#8221;. Paul repeats this phrase from <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1</a>, bookending the section. Confidence in Christ keeps discouragement at bay. &#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> urges, &#8220;Let us not grow weary in well-doing.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a> calls us to &#8220;consider Him who endured such hostility&#8230; so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.&#8221; Refusing to despair is not a grin-and-bear-it mindset; it is faith anchored in God&#8217;s character and promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Though our outer self is wasting away</b><p>The apostle openly acknowledges physical decline: injuries, sickness, aging, persecution (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>). &#8226; <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>: &#8220;My flesh and my heart may fail.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1-7</a> paints aging in vivid detail. &#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a> likens the body to a temporary tent that will one day be replaced by an eternal house.

The "outward man," the material framework of the body, is undergoing a gradual process of decay, but the "inward man," the higher spiritual life, is "day by day" passing through successive stages of renewal, gaining fresh energies. This verb also, and its derivative "renewal," are specially characteristic of St. Paul.
