Macedonia, a region in northern Greece, was a key area for the spread of the Gospel. The cities of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea were located here, and Paul had previously established churches in these areas (Acts 16-17). The mention of Macedonia highlights the geographical expansion of early Christianity and the strategic importance of this region in Paul's ministry.<p><b>our bodies had no rest</b><br>This phrase indicates the physical exhaustion and relentless nature of Paul's missionary work. Paul often faced hardships, including long travels, persecution, and the demands of ministry (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>). The lack of rest underscores the sacrificial nature of his service and dedication to spreading the Gospel, reflecting the call to endure hardships for the sake of Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>).<p><b>but we were pressed from every direction</b><br>Paul frequently encountered opposition and challenges, both from Jewish leaders and Gentile authorities. This phrase suggests the intense pressure and adversity he faced, which is a recurring theme in his letters (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8-9</a>). The imagery of being "pressed" conveys the idea of being under constant strain, yet it also highlights Paul's resilience and reliance on God's strength (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p><b>conflicts on the outside</b><br>The external conflicts likely refer to the persecution and opposition Paul faced from both Jews and Gentiles. In Acts, we see numerous instances where Paul was opposed, imprisoned, or attacked (<a href="/acts/14-19.htm">Acts 14:19</a>, <a href="/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-24</a>). These conflicts were part of the spiritual warfare that Paul often described, emphasizing the reality of opposition in the Christian life (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p><b>fears within</b><br>This phrase reveals Paul's internal struggles and anxieties, possibly concerning the well-being of the churches he founded or the effectiveness of his ministry. Despite his strong faith, Paul was not immune to fear and worry, which makes his reliance on God's comfort and strength all the more profound (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>). This internal conflict also reflects the human aspect of Paul's character, showing that even the most devoted servants of God experience fear and doubt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Corinthians, sharing his personal experiences and struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/macedonia.htm">Macedonia</a></b><br>A region in Northern Greece where Paul traveled during his missionary journeys.

He had come from Troas full of anxiety and agitation. He arrived in Macedonia. Much remained the same. His body was still suffering from want of rest, even though his spirit had found relief in the thought that the coming of Titus could not now be far off. (Comp. "our <span class= "ital">flesh"</span> here, with "I had no rest for my <span class= "ital">spirit</span>" in <a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2Corinthians 2:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span>--We have no knowledge to what the first clause refers. It is natural to think either of dangers and persecutions from the heathen, or, probably, of conflicts with the party of the circumcision, or, as he calls them in Philippians 3, of the "concision," at Philippi. The "fears" manifestly refer to his alarm and anxiety about the effect produced by his first Epistle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For, when we were come into Macedonia.</span> "For <span class="accented">even</span> when we came." The word "affliction" reminds St. Paul to resume the thread of the narrative which makes this letter almost <span class="accented">like an itinerary</span>. He has spoken of his trials in Ephesus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>) and in the Troad (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12, 13</a>), and now he tells them that <span class="accented">even</span> in Macedonia he was no less troubled and agitated. <span class="cmt_word">Our flesh had no rest.</span> <span class="accented">External</span> troubles assailed him as well as inward anxiety. "Had" seems here to be the best reading (B, F, G, K); not "has had," which may be borrowed from <a href="/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="accented">Rest</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remission, respite</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>But we were troubled on every side;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but in everything being afflicted</span>. The style, in its picturesque irregularity, almost seems as though it were broken by sobs. <span class="cmt_word">Without were fightings, within were fears.</span> "From without battles, from within fears." No light is thrown on these "battles." The Acts of the Apostles has no details to give us of this brief stay in Macedonia. The "fears" were doubtless still connected with anxiety as to the reception of Titus, and of his First Epistle (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-20.htm">1 Corinthians 12:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
