The mildness and gentleness of Christ are attributes that are consistently portrayed throughout the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as "gentle and humble in heart." These qualities are essential for understanding the nature of Christ's ministry, which was not one of force or coercion but of love and invitation. The Apostle Paul invokes these attributes to set the tone for his appeal, aligning his approach with that of Christ Himself.<p><b>I appeal to you</b><br>Paul's use of the word "appeal" indicates a request or exhortation rather than a command. This reflects the apostolic authority tempered with pastoral care. In the Greco-Roman world, appeals were often made by those in positions of authority to encourage or persuade others to a particular course of action. Paul's appeal is rooted in his desire for the Corinthians to respond willingly and positively to his guidance, reflecting the relational aspect of his leadership.<p><b>I, Paul, who am humble when face to face with you</b><br>Paul acknowledges a perception among the Corinthians that he is humble or meek in person. This humility is consistent with the teachings of Christ, who valued servanthood and humility (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>). In the cultural context of Corinth, where rhetorical skill and public persona were highly valued, Paul's humility might have been misunderstood as weakness. However, Paul embraces this humility as a reflection of Christ's own approach to leadership and ministry.<p><b>but bold when away</b><br>Paul contrasts his perceived humility in person with his boldness in his letters. This boldness is not arrogance but a necessary firmness in addressing issues within the Corinthian church. The boldness in his letters, such as in 1 Corinthians, was often required to correct, instruct, and guide the church in his absence. This duality of humility and boldness reflects the balance of grace and truth in Christian leadership, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where Jesus is described as "full of grace and truth."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Corinthians.

Paul is not speaking in generalities; he is tackling a real, present situation, just as Scripture addresses our lives in real time (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Now&#8221; ties this verse to the ongoing defense of his apostolic ministry begun in chapter 7, reminding us that every verse fits into a larger, God-breathed context (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the mildness and gentleness of Christ</b><p>&#8226; Paul roots his appeal in Christ&#8217;s own character, reflecting the Lord who said, &#8220;Take My yoke upon you&#8230; for I am gentle and humble in heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s mildness doesn&#8217;t negate strength; it channels it through loving restraint (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, confronting problems must mirror this same balance of firmness and tenderness (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I appeal to you</b><p>&#8226; Rather than commanding, Paul pleads. Apostolic authority chooses persuasion over coercion, echoing <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>, where shepherds lead by example, not domination.<p>&#8226; The literal sense shows Paul obeying Jesus&#8217; pattern: He both teaches truth and invites response (<a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I, Paul</b><p>&#8226; Naming himself underscores accountability. The messenger cannot be separated from the message (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; His transparency reminds us that God uses identifiable, imperfect servants to convey perfect truth (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who am humble when face to face with you</b><p>&#8226; Critics said Paul&#8217;s physical presence lacked impressiveness (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm">2 Corinthians 10:10</a>). He admits humility, not as weakness but as Christ-like meekness (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal interaction often calls for quiet patience&#8212;&#8220;quick to listen, slow to speak&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but bold when away</b><p>&#8226; His letters carried weight and clarity (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>). Distance allowed stronger wording without personal intimidation.<p>&#8226; This balance models how written communication can serve the church when done in truth and love (<a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Boldness is Spirit-given courage (<a href="/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>), never arrogance. Paul&#8217;s boldness sought their restoration, not their ruin (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Paul ties his urgent plea to the living example of Christ&#8217;s gentle strength. He shows that true spiritual leadership combines meek personal presence with decisive, truth-filled counsel. The verse calls believers to approach conflicts the same way: anchored in Christ&#8217;s character, humble in person, bold for righteousness, and always aiming for the growth of God&#8217;s people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_corinthians/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">X.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now I Paul myself beseech you.</span>--His thoughts, as has been said, have travelled back to Corinth. The stinging words which Titus had reported to him (see Note on <a href="/2_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.">2Corinthians 10:10</a>) vex his soul. He speaks in the tone of the suppressed indignation which shows itself in a keen incisive irony. The opening formula is one which he reserves as emphasising an exceptionally strong emotion (<a href="/galatians/5-2.htm" title="Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.">Galatians 5:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By the meekness and gentleness of Christ.</span>--On the precise ethical significance of the former word see Note on <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm" title="Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.">Matthew 5:5</a>; on that of the second, on <a href="/acts/24-4.htm" title="Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious to you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.">Acts 24:4</a>. The temper described by the latter is that of one who does not press his rights, but acts in the spirit of equitable concession. The use of the formula of adjuration implies (1) that he felt how the opponents of whom he is about to speak were lacking in those two excellencies; (2) that he could appeal to what they knew of the personal character of Jesus as possessing them.
