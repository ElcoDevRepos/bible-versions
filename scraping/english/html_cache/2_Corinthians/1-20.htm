These promises include covenants made with figures like Abraham, Moses, and David, as well as prophecies concerning the coming Messiah. The promises encompass blessings, redemption, and eternal life. They are foundational to the faith and hope of believers, demonstrating God's faithfulness and unchanging nature.<p><b>are &#8220;Yes&#8221; in Christ.</b><br>In Christ, all of God's promises find their fulfillment and affirmation. Jesus is the embodiment of God's faithfulness, as He fulfills the law and the prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). This phrase underscores the belief that Jesus is the central figure in God's redemptive plan, fulfilling prophecies such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. Christ's life, death, and resurrection confirm God's promises of salvation and reconciliation.<p><b>And so through Him,</b><br>This indicates that it is only through Jesus Christ that believers have access to the promises of God. Jesus serves as the mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>), and it is through His sacrifice and resurrection that believers are able to partake in the divine promises. This highlights the necessity of faith in Christ for salvation and the reception of God's promises.<p><b>our &#8220;Amen&#8221; is spoken</b><br>"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," used to express agreement and affirmation. In this context, it signifies the believer's response to God's promises, acknowledging their truth and reliability. The use of "Amen" reflects a deep-seated faith and trust in God's word, as seen in its frequent use in both Jewish and Christian liturgies.<p><b>to the glory of God.</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the fulfillment of God's promises in Christ is to bring glory to God. This reflects the biblical theme that all things are to be done for God's glory (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The realization of God's promises through Christ leads to worship and praise, as believers recognize His sovereignty, grace, and love.

The thought in either case is the same. The promises of God have been fulfilled and ratified in Christ. He was, as it were, a living incarnate "Amen" to those promises. Comp. St. John's use of the word Amen as a name of Christ, the "faithful and true witness" (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>).

All the promises of God find in him their unchangeable fulfilment. He was "a minister to confirm the promises" alike to the Jews and the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>); and "the premise of the eternal inheritance" can only be fulfilled in him (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And in him Amen.</span> The true reading is," Wherefore by him also is the Amen to God, uttered by us to his glory" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, F, G, etc.). In Christ is the "yea" of immutable promise and absolute fulfilment; the Church utters the "Amen" of perfect faith and grateful adoration. Here, as in <a href="/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>, we have a proof of the ancientness of the custom by which the congregation utters the "Amen" at the end of praise and prayer.
