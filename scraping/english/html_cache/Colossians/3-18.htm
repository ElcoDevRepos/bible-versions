The concept of submission here is often understood as a voluntary and respectful yielding to the leadership of the husband, reflecting the order established in creation (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-24</a>). In the cultural context of the first century, the Greco-Roman world was patriarchal, and the idea of submission was a common social norm. However, the Christian perspective introduced a mutual respect and love that was revolutionary for its time, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-33</a>, where husbands are called to love their wives sacrificially, as Christ loved the church. This mutual submission is rooted in the example of Christ, who submitted to the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p><b>as is fitting in the Lord</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the submission is not absolute but is to be understood within the framework of Christian discipleship. It is "fitting" or appropriate because it aligns with the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. The phrase "in the Lord" indicates that the submission is part of one's service to Christ, suggesting that it should be done in a manner that honors God and reflects His character. This aligns with the broader biblical principle that all relationships and actions should be conducted in a way that glorifies God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The phrase also implies that any form of submission that contradicts God's commands or leads to sin is not fitting. This understanding is consistent with the call for believers to live in a manner worthy of the Lord (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_at_colossae.htm">The Church at Colossae</a></b><br>A Christian community in the ancient city of Colossae, located in modern-day Turkey.

THE CHRISTIAN VIEW OF FAMILY DUTIES. We note that in each of the three family relations here dealt with, the subordinate party is first addressed, and the duty of submission is primarily insisted upon (vers. 18, 20, 22: comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13, 18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>). So in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3, 5-8</a>. There may have been some special reason for this in the state of the Asiatic Churches or of Greek society in that region. But other indications show (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-24.htm">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:11, 12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>; <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5, 9, 10</a>; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>) that the apostle perceived and sought to check the danger of unsettlement in the natural order of family and social life which often attends great spiritual revolutions, especially when they are in the direction of religious liberty. As in the case of Luther, the apostle's later teaching is largely directed against the antinomianism which resulted, by way of perversion and abuse, from the preaching of salvation by grace and of the sanctity of the individual believer (comp. introductory note to this chapter). Observe how <span class="accented">the Lord</span> and his authority are made to furnish a higher sanction for each of these natural duties. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fit in the Lord</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11-15</a>; <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). On this duty the apostle dilates in the Ephesian letter, in illustration of its teaching respecting "Christ and the Church" (comp. the very different treatment of it in <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1-7</a>), The use of the <span class="accented">article</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in the nominative of address is frequent in New Testament, though not in classical Greek.

Like all men of a sound moral nature, St Paul has a strong sense of natural propriety. The adjunct "in the Lord" belongs to "was fit," not "be subject" (comp. ver. 20). The constitution of nature, as we have learnt in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>, is grounded "in the Lord." In <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a> St. Paul shows that this inherent propriety has a deep spiritual significance; and he makes the subjection of the Church to her heavenly Lord a new reason for wifely submission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Wives,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gynaikes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
