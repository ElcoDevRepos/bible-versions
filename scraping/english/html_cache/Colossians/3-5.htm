The term "put to death" suggests a complete and final break from sinful behaviors. This echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>, where He advises drastic measures to avoid sin. The use of "therefore" connects this command to the preceding verses, where believers are reminded of their new life in Christ and the need to set their minds on things above.<p><b>the components of your earthly nature:</b><br>The "earthly nature" refers to the sinful tendencies inherent in humanity due to the Fall (Genesis 3). This nature is contrasted with the new nature believers receive in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). The call to put to death these components is a call to live according to the Spirit, as Paul also discusses in <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>. The term "components" suggests that these are parts of a larger whole, indicating that sin is multifaceted and pervasive.<p><b>sexual immorality,</b><br>Sexual immorality, or "porneia" in Greek, encompasses all forms of illicit sexual behavior, including adultery, fornication, and homosexuality. In the Greco-Roman world, such practices were common and often accepted, making this command counter-cultural. The early church was called to a higher standard, reflecting God's design for sexuality as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and affirmed by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.<p><b>impurity,</b><br>Impurity goes beyond physical acts to include thoughts and intentions that are morally unclean. This term is often associated with ritual uncleanness in the Old Testament (Leviticus 15), but in the New Testament, it takes on a moral dimension. Jesus emphasized the importance of inner purity in <a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>, highlighting that true righteousness begins in the heart.<p><b>lust,</b><br>Lust refers to intense and uncontrolled desires, often of a sexual nature. It is a distortion of the natural desires God has given. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> describes how lust leads to sin and ultimately death. The call to put to death lust is a call to align one's desires with God's will, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>, where believers are urged to crucify the flesh with its passions.<p><b>evil desires,</b><br>Evil desires encompass a broader range of sinful cravings beyond sexual lust. These desires are rooted in the sinful nature and are contrary to the desires of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>). The transformation of desires is a key aspect of sanctification, as believers are called to desire what is good, pure, and holy (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>).<p><b>and greed,</b><br>Greed, or covetousness, is an insatiable desire for more, often at the expense of others. It is a form of idolatry because it places material possessions or wealth above God. Jesus warned against greed in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, emphasizing that life does not consist in an abundance of possessions. The Tenth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>) also addresses this issue, highlighting its longstanding presence as a human struggle.<p><b>which is idolatry.</b><br>Idolatry is the worship of anything other than the one true God. By equating greed with idolatry, Paul underscores the spiritual danger of allowing desires for material things to take precedence over devotion to God. This connection is seen throughout Scripture, where idolatry is consistently condemned (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4, 1</a> <a href="/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>). The call to put to death these sins is ultimately a call to worship God alone, as seen in Jesus' declaration in <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where the recipients of this letter resided.

The verb is decisive and ongoing; every new day is another swing of the sword against the flesh. In practice this looks like:<p>&#8226; decisive repentance the moment sin surfaces (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>)<p>&#8226; intentional replacement of sinful patterns with Spirit-led habits (<a href="/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>)<p>&#8226; accountability with fellow believers who &#8220;spur one another on toward love and good deeds&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the components of your earthly nature</b><p>The &#8220;earthly nature&#8221; is the residue of the old self that clings to us even after we are raised with Christ (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>). Paul lists specific &#8220;components&#8221; to expose them to the light, much like cleaning out a drawer item by item. Our new identity calls us to &#8220;put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>). Yet the contrast remains clear:<p>&#8226; old self &#8212; dominated by sin, destined for wrath (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>)<p>&#8226; new self &#8212; indwelt by the Spirit, oriented to heaven (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sexual immorality</b><p>This word embraces every sexual act outside the covenant of one man and one woman in marriage. God&#8217;s will is &#8220;that you abstain from sexual immorality; each of you must learn to control his own body in holiness and honor&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a>). Scripture treats sexual sin as uniquely damaging: &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a man can commit is outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). Practical steps include:<p>&#8226; guarding eyes and mind (<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>)<p>&#8226; establishing clear boundaries in relationships (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>)<p>&#8226; delighting in God-given marital intimacy where applicable (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>)<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>impurity</b><p>Impurity widens the lens to any moral uncleanness&#8212;thoughts, jokes, media, habits.

"Your" is omitted by most textual critics, but English idiom requires it in translation. In its absence a stronger emphasis falls on the defining clause, "that are upon the earth." As these things may no longer be pursued or studied (vers. 1, 2), the organs devoted to them must be put to death. These <span class="accented">members</span> are indeed those of the actual body (<a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13, 19</a>; <a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 23</a>; <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>); but these <span class="accented">in so far as ruled hitherto by sinful impulse and habit</span>, constituting the body of "the old man" (ver. 9; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>), "of the flesh" (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>), "of sin," and "of death" (<a href="/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6</a>; <a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>), with "sinful passions working in its members, bearing fruit unto death" (<a href="/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>): setup, note, <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>. <span class="accented">That</span> body is "made dead" by destruction of the evil passions that animated it. The body of "the new man" is physically identical with it, but different in moral habit and diathesis - a difference that manifests itself even in bodily expression and manner (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> occurs besides in the New Testament only in <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a> (in <a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, a still stronger word is used of "the practices" of the body): as the aged Abraham had been <span class="accented">made dead</span> in respect of the natural possibility of fatherhood, so the body of the Christian is to be dead for purposes of sin. If there were any doubt as to the writer's meaning, the next clause removes it. His language has approached that of the philosophical ascetics (see <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, note and quotations); hence the abrupt explanatory apposition that follows: <span class="cmt_word">fornication, uncleanness,</span> (sensual) <span class="cmt_word">passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="/luke/12-21.htm">Luke 12:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/49-6.htm">Psalm 49:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>). To these vices the Colossian Gentiles (some of them at least) had been to such a degree devoted that their <span class="accented">members</span> had become virtually identified therewith. The first two sins are related as particular and general. The second pair, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, are combined in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> in contrast to "(bodily) sanctification and honour" (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>, and "passions of dishonour," <a href="/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>). The former denotes a morbid, inflamed condition of the sensual appetite; the latter, craving for some particular gratification of it (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). Neither of these words is etymologically, or invariably, evil in sense. The degradation of such terms in all languages is a sad evidence of the corruption of our nature. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is both wider and more intense in meaning than our "covetousness." It denotes radically the disposition to "have more," "grasping greed," "selfishness grown to a passion." Hence it applies to sins of impurity, greediness for sensual pleasure (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); but by the emphatic use of the article ("the covetousness"), and by the words that follow, it is marked out as a distinct type of sin; so in <a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>, where "uncleanness" and "greed" are stigmatized as <span class="accented">vile</span> forms of sin. This word, often used by St. Paul, is peculiar to him in the New Testament. "The which" (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: setup. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>) gives a reason while it states a fact ("inasmuch as it is idolatry"). For the thought, setup. <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>, also <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; it is a commonplace of religion, and appears in Philo and Jewish rabbis (see Lightfoot). Lightfoot places a colon after "upon the earth," and supposes "fornication," etc., to be "proleptic accusatives," looking forward to some verb unexpressed, such as "put off" (ver. 8). But this is needless (see Winer, p. 666), and the command, "make dead your members," requires this qualifying explanation. The grammatical awkwardness of the apposition is not without rhetorical effect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Put to death,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#925;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Nekr&#333;sate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3499.htm">Strong's 3499: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lit. and met: I put to death, make as dead; I render weak, impotent.
