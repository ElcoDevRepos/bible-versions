It signifies the end of the old self, which is dominated by sin and worldly desires. This concept is rooted in the idea of dying to sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2-4</a>, where Paul explains that believers are baptized into Christ's death. The death here is metaphorical, representing a decisive break from the past life of sin. Historically, this aligns with the early Christian practice of baptism, symbolizing death to the old life and resurrection to a new life in Christ.<p><b>and your life is now hidden</b><br>The notion of being "hidden" suggests security and protection. In the cultural context of the time, being hidden could imply being kept safe from harm or being preserved for a future purpose. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as a refuge and fortress, as seen in Psalms 27:5. The hidden life also indicates a transformation that is not yet fully visible to the world, echoing the idea of the already-but-not-yet aspect of salvation.<p><b>with Christ</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the believer's union with Christ, a central theme in Pauline theology. Being "with Christ" signifies a close, personal relationship and shared identity with Him. This union is foundational to the Christian life, as it is through Christ that believers receive spiritual blessings and eternal life. Theologically, this reflects the concept of being in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where believers are described as new creations.<p><b>in God</b><br>The phrase "in God" underscores the ultimate source of the believer's security and identity. It reflects the Trinitarian relationship, where Christ is in God, and believers are in Christ. This connection provides assurance of salvation and eternal life, as seen in <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-30</a>, where Jesus speaks of His followers being secure in the Father's hand. The cultural context of the time would have understood this as a profound statement of belonging and protection, contrasting with the insecurity of pagan beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_at_colossae.htm">The Church at Colossae</a></b><br>A Christian community in the ancient city of Colossae, located in modern-day Turkey.

The phrase here is to be taken in its whole sense, both of "death to sin" and "death to the visible world."<p><span class= "bld">Your life is hid with Christ in God . . . Christ who is our life.</span>--In these two phrases, again, we pass from a lower to a higher expression of the same truth. (1) First, "our life is hid with Christ in God." The spiritual life in man is a "hidden life," having its source in God; the full conviction of it, as distinct from the mere instinctive consciousness of it in the mind itself, comes only from the belief that it is the image of God in us, and is sustained by constant communion with Him. If God be our God at all, we must live; for "He is not the God of the dead, but of the living" (<a href="/matthew/22-32.htm" title="I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.">Matthew 22:32</a>). It is also "hid with Christ." Our Lord's ascent to His glory in heaven is at once the pledge and the means of this our spiritual communion with God. It is "with Him" that we can "in heart and mind ascend;" it is "with Him" that we can "continually dwell." (2) But this is not all. "Christ is our life" now as well as hereafter. This is simply a summary of the two truths;" Christ liveth in me (see <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), as the source of life; and "To me to live (the actual condition of life) is Christ" (<a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>). It is but a brief expression of faith in the truth which our Lord Himself declared (<a href="/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>), "I am the Life; whoso liveth and believeth in Me shall never die." (Comp. <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>.) Hence our spiritual life is not only a being "with Christ;" it is also unity with Christ in the bosom of the Father. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye died, and your life is hid, with Christ, in God</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="/romans/6-1.htm">Romans 6:1-14</a>; <a href="/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>; <a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>). In this <span class="accented">hidden life</span> of the Christian lies the ground and the spring of the more outward life of thought and endeavour of vers. 1, 2. And this <span class="accented">life</span> comes through <span class="accented">death</span>, from that "dying with Christ" out of which we "rose with him" (ver. 1; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4, 8</a>).

The Christian's <span class="accented">life</span> is lodged in the sphere of "the unseen and eternal." It centres in <span class="accented">Christ</span>, and as he is <span class="accented">hidden</span> - withdrawn from the world of sense, yet with us always in his Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-20</a>; <a href="/john/16-16.htm">John 16:16-22</a>) - so our life <span class="accented">with him.</span> And if "with Christ," then "in God;" for "Christ is God's" (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>); "lives to God" (<a href="/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>), and "is at God's right hand" (ver. 1), being "the Son of his love" (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>; <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>). The apostle says, "in God" ("in heaven," <a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a>), to emphasize the fact of the union of Christ with God, or perhaps to deepen the reader's sense of the sacredness of this life in Christ (comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14-16</a>). "Is hid" (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>), another allusion to the fondness of the Colossian errorists for <span class="accented">mysteries.</span> In <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a> St. Paul spoke of the ancient mystery of a Christ for all the world; then of the new, perpetual mystery of a Christ dwelling within believing hearts. But this second mystery is equally that of <span class="accented">our life in Christ</span> as of <span class="accented">Christ's life in us</span>, lifting us to heaven while it brings him down to earth. This mutual indwelling of the Head in heaven and the members upon earth is the most intimate and inscrutable of all secrets (<a href="/john/14-20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>; <a href="/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22, 23, 26</a>). "The world knows neither Christ nor Christians, and Christians do not even know themselves" (Bengel).
