The term "labor" suggests intense effort and toil, reflecting the physical and spiritual challenges Paul faced. This echoes his commitment seen in other letters, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>, where he speaks of laboring more abundantly than others, yet attributing it to God's grace. The historical context of Paul's missionary journeys, which involved travel across the Roman Empire, often under harsh conditions, underscores the depth of his commitment.<p><b>Striving with all His energy</b><br>The word "striving" is translated from the Greek "agonizomai," which conveys the idea of an athlete competing in a contest. This metaphor highlights the disciplined and focused effort required in ministry. The source of Paul's strength is not his own, but God's energy. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul declares he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. The cultural context of athletic games in the Greco-Roman world would have made this imagery particularly vivid for Paul's audience.<p><b>Working powerfully within me</b><br>Paul acknowledges that the effectiveness of his ministry is due to God's power at work within him. This reflects the biblical theme of divine empowerment, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, where God is described as able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power at work within us. Theologically, this underscores the concept of sanctification, where believers are transformed and enabled by the Holy Spirit. This phrase also connects to the idea of Christ living in believers, as expressed in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, emphasizing the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians.

We need not, with Meyer and Ellicott, distinguish inward from outward <span class="accented">striving</span> in this word. The apostle's bodily sufferings (ver. 21) and his mental anxiety (<a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>) alike enter into the mighty struggle which he is maintaining on the Church's behalf, and which strains every fibre of his nature to the utmost (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). "Striving" implies opponents against whom he contends (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-26.htm">2 Corinthians 11:26</a>); "toiling hard," the painful efforts he has to make. In this toll he is divinely sustained, for he "strives according to his [Christ's: comp. <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>] working." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("energy," "operative force," "power in action") - another word of St. Paul's vocabulary (frequent also in Aristotle) - is used by him only of supernatural power, "a working of God," "of Satan" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which worketh in me with power</span> (ver. 11; <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). The "energy of Christ" is such that it "effectually works" in the apostle; the same idea is repeated in noun and verb (ver. 11, note). The verb is middle in voice, as this "working" is that in which the Divine "energy of Christ" puts itself forth and shows what it can do (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3-6</a>); see note on "bearing fruit," ver. 6, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 318 (dynamic middle). So it works unmistakably "in [or, 'with'] power." Never do we find this consciousness of the Divine power dwelling in himself expressed by St. Paul with such joyous confidence as at this period (see <a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9, 20</a>; and comp. note on ver. 23 b). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this end</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I labor,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#959;&#960;&#953;&#8182;</span> <span class="translit">(kopi&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2872.htm">Strong's 2872: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of kopos; to feel fatigue; by implication, to work hard.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">striving</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(ag&#333;nizomenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_75.htm">Strong's 75: </a> </span><span class="str2">From agon; to struggle, literally, figuratively, or genitive case.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(kata)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2596.htm">Strong's 2596: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; down, in varied relations (genitive, dative or accusative) with which it is joined).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
