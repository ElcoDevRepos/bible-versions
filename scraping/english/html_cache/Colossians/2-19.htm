In the context of Colossians, Paul warns against false teachings that detract from Christ's supremacy. Historically, the Colossian church faced challenges from Gnostic influences that promoted secret knowledge over Christ's sufficiency. Losing connection to the head implies a spiritual disconnection from Christ, leading to a lack of true spiritual growth and understanding.<p><b>from whom the whole body</b><br>The "whole body" refers to the Church, the collective body of believers. This imagery is consistent with Paul's other writings, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where he describes the Church as one body with many parts. This unity under Christ underscores the importance of each member's role and the interdependence of believers.<p><b>supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments</b><br>This phrase highlights the interconnectedness and unity of the Church. The "joints and ligaments" symbolize the relationships and functions within the body of Christ that hold it together. In a historical context, this reflects the early Christian communities' emphasis on fellowship and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>. The imagery suggests that just as physical joints and ligaments are essential for bodily function, so are the spiritual and relational bonds among believers for the Church's health.<p><b>grows as God causes it to grow</b><br>This emphasizes divine sovereignty in the growth and maturity of the Church. It aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6-7</a>, where he acknowledges that while human effort is involved, it is ultimately God who gives the increase. This growth is not merely numerical but also spiritual, reflecting deeper maturity and understanding of God's will. The phrase reassures believers that their spiritual development is under God's control, encouraging reliance on His power rather than human wisdom or effort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae to correct false teachings and encourage spiritual growth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_colossae.htm">The Church in Colossae</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community facing challenges from false teachings and philosophies that threatened their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_head.htm">The Head (Christ)</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is the head of the Church, the body of believers.

The agreement is nearly verbal, but the characteristic difference of idea, so often noted, is still traceable. There the body "maketh increase unto the building up of itself in love;" here the increase is simply "the increase of God"--the increase which God gives, and which grows into His likeness. In this passage there is also a greater scientific exactness: the "joints and bands" are the "articulations and ligaments;" the two functions thereof are the diffusion of nourishment and the knitting together of organic unity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not holding fast the Head</span> (vers. 6, 8; <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>; <a href="/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). In the last verse the errorist was judged "out of his own mouth," and the intrinsic hollowness of his pretensions was exposed. Now" he appears before the judgment seat of Christ," charged with high treason against him, the Lord alike of the kingdoms of nature and of grace. So the apostle falls back once more (comp. ver. 10) on the foundation laid down in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a>, on which his whole polemic rests. Both in creation and redemption, the philosophic Judaists assigned to the angels a <span class="accented">role</span> inconsistent with the sovereign mediatorship of Christ (see notes on vers. 10 and 15). <span class="cmt_word">From whom all the body, through its joinings and bands being supplied and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>).

Gnosticism from the beginning tended to disintegrate the Church, by the caste feeling (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>, note; Colossians 3:11) and the sectarian spirit to which it gave birth (ver. 8; <a href="/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). Its vague and subjective doctrines were ready to assume a different form with each new exponent, Here lies the connection between this and the Ephesian letter, the doctrine of the Church following upon and growing out of that of the person of Christ, each being threatened - the latter immediately, the former more remotely - by the rise of the new Judaeo-Christian mystic rationalism. Colossians asserts the "thou in me" of <a href="/john/17-23.htm">John 17:23</a>; Ephesians the corresponding "I in them;" and both the consequent "they made perfect in one" (comp., especially, <a href="/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14-21</a> and Ephesians 4:7-16 with <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> and Colossians 2:9-15).

So, by the organic cooperation of the whole structure, the body of Christ is <span class="accented">furnished with its supplies</span>, enabled to receive and dispense to each member the needed sustenance; and "knit together" (ver. 2), drawn into a close and firm unity. "Supplied" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>) indicates a sustenance both required and due. In <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> we read of <span class="accented">the increase of the gospel</span>, in <a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a> of <span class="accented">the individual believer</span>, and now of <span class="accented">the Church as a body</span>) <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>). "The increase of God" is that which God bestows (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>), as it proceeds "from Christ" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: ver. 10; <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>), in whom is "the fulness of the Godhead" (ver. 9: comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a> and Ephesians 3:17 - 19). In <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a> the same idea is expressed in almost the same terms. There, however, the growth appears as proper to the body, resulting from its very constitution; here, as a bestowment of God, dependent, therefore, upon Christ, and ceasing if the Church ceases to <span class="accented">hold fast</span> to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he loses connection</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(krat&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2902.htm">Strong's 2902: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kratos; to use strength, i.e. Seize or retain.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
