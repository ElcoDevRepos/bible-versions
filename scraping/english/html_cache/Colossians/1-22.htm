Reconciliation is a key theme in Paul's writings, highlighting the restoration of the relationship between God and humanity. This reconciliation is initiated by God, underscoring His grace and mercy. The concept of reconciliation is also found in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>, where Paul speaks of God reconciling the world to Himself through Christ.<p><b>by Christ&#8217;s physical body</b><br>The physical body of Christ is central to the doctrine of the Incarnation, affirming that Jesus was fully human. This counters early heresies like Docetism, which denied Christ's true humanity. The physicality of Jesus is crucial for the atonement, as it was necessary for Him to be fully human to bear the sins of humanity. <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-17</a> also discusses the importance of Christ's humanity in His role as a high priest.<p><b>through death</b><br>Christ's death is the means by which reconciliation is accomplished. The sacrificial nature of His death fulfills Old Testament prophecies and typologies, such as the Passover lamb (Exodus 12) and the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The death of Christ is central to the gospel message, as it provides the atonement for sin and satisfies the justice of God.<p><b>to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless</b><br>This phrase describes the result of reconciliation: believers are made holy, unblemished, and blameless. Holiness refers to being set apart for God, a theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>, <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). Being unblemished and blameless echoes the requirements for sacrificial animals in the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>), indicating the purity and righteousness imparted to believers through Christ.<p><b>in His presence&#8212;</b><br>The ultimate goal of reconciliation is to bring believers into the presence of God. This reflects the restoration of the relationship that was broken by sin, allowing for fellowship with God. The presence of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, from the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>) to the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>) and ultimately in the new creation (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this verse, whose physical death and resurrection are the means of reconciliation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossian_church.htm">Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of believers in the city of Colossae.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who initiates reconciliation through Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation.htm">Reconciliation</a></b><br>The event and process by which believers are restored to a right relationship with God through Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation_through_christ.htm">Reconciliation through Christ</a></b><br>Understand that reconciliation with God is solely through the physical death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Through His literal, physical death, God has already reconciled us, with the aim of presenting us holy, unblemished, and blameless in His very presence. The verse moves us from alienation to acceptance, from guilt to glory, and assures us that what God has begun He will surely finish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">In the body of his flesh.</span>--There seems to be some emphasis on the word "flesh:" just as in the parallel of <a href="/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>, the expression is "in one body," with a characteristic emphasis on the word "one," suiting the genius of the passage. The meaning is, of course, His natural body, as distinguished from His mystic Body, spoken of above (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>). But this is no sufficient reason for the use of this phrase, for there could be no confusion between them in this passage. Hence, without ascribing to the word "flesh" a distinctly polemical intention, we may not unnaturally suppose that there was present to St. Paul's mind the thought of the Gnosticism, which depreciated the body as evil, and which must have always inclined to the idea that "Jesus Christ had not come in the flesh" (<a href="/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1John 4:2-3</a>); and that the presence of this thought induced some special emphasis in his language.<p><span class= "bld">Holy and unblameable and unreproveable.</span>--See Note on <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>. The word "to present" is used both in a sacrificial sense (as in <a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) and in the sense of introduction and presentation (as of a bride, see <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The words, "holy and unblameable," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"without blemish," suit the former sense. But "unreproveable" is incongruous with it, and the parallel passage (<a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) speaks of "access" or introduction to the Father. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the body of his flesh</span> (ver. 20; <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-1.htm">1 Peter 4:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>; <a href="/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>; <a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). With a significant emphasis, the material body of Christ is made the instrument of that reconciliation in the carrying out of which "his whole fulness" is engaged (vers. 19, 20); see note on "thought," ver. 21, and on "body," <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. The necessity of the double expression was shown by the fact that the Gnostic Marcion erased "of his flesh" from the text of this Epistle, and interpreted "the body" as "the Church;" Bengel and others suppose "of his flesh "to be added to prevent this mistake (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:19). This phrase was the crux of Docetism, whose principles were indeed implicitly contained in the Alexandrine-Jewish philosophy with its contempt for matter and the physical life, which was now first beginning to leaven the Church. <span class="accented">Body</span> is antithetical to <span class="accented">soul: flesh</span> to <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The former is individual and concrete, the actual physical organism; the latter denotes the material of which it consists, the bodily nature in its essence and characteristics (comp. note on ver. 11; and see Cremer's 'Lexicon' on these words). "In the body" is not "by the body," nor "during his earthly life" (as though opposed to "out of the body," <a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-3.htm">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>), but "as incarnate." The Epistle to the Hebrews expands the thought of our Epistle in its own way in <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>. That reconciliation is through the (or, <span class="accented">his</span>) death (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15, 16</a>; <a href="/john/11-51.htm">John 11:51, 52</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>) is the fundamental axiom of the gospel (ver. 5), already implied in vers. 14 and 20. And the atoning death presupposes the Incarnation (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). The two foregoing phrases belong grammatically to ver. 21. To present you holy and without blemish and unreprovable before him (ver. 28; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>); before "Christ" (ver. 19), who is "Judge" (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22, 23</a>) as well as "King" and "Redeemer" (vers. 13, 14): this also belongs to his <span class="accented">fulness.</span> He will "himself present the Church to himself" (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, Revised Text; also <a href="/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>). In this <span class="accented">presentation</span> his redeeming work culminates (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; and, in view of the connection of vers. 22 and 23, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-6.htm">1 Corinthians 1:6-9</a>). So, in general, Meyer and Alford. Ellicott and Lightfoot refer to <span class="accented">God's present approbations</span>, quoting <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, a parallel much less close than ver. 27, and supposing "God" the subject of the verb (see note on ver. 19). "Holy erga Deum; <span class="accented">without blemish</span> respectu vestri; <span class="accented">unreprovable</span> respectu proximi" (Bengel). (On "holy," see note, ver. 2; also <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>.) "Apropos is not "without blame," but "without blemish," "immaculate" (Lightfoot, R.V.; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>: comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). In the LXX it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">tamim</span> ("integer"), "faultless" in bodily condition or in moral character. "Unreprovable," as a judicial term ("without charge that can be preferred"), points to the judgment day, and hence is wanting in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6, 7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#965;&#957;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(nyni)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3570.htm">Strong's 3570: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of nun for emphasis; just now.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He has reconciled [you]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#942;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#958;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apokat&#275;llaxen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_604.htm">Strong's 604: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reconcile, change from one state of feeling to another.
