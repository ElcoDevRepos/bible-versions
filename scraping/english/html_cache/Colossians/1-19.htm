It reflects the sovereign will of God, highlighting that the reconciliation of creation through Christ was not a reluctant decision but one that brought God joy. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where it is said that it pleased the Lord to crush the suffering servant, indicating God's purposeful plan in redemption.<p><b>to have all His fullness</b><br>The term "fullness" (Greek: pleroma) is significant in the context of combating early Gnostic beliefs that were beginning to infiltrate the church in Colossae. Gnostics claimed that divine fullness was distributed among various emanations or lesser deities. This phrase counters such beliefs by affirming that the entirety of God's nature and attributes are fully present in Christ. This is further supported by <a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>, which speaks of receiving grace upon grace from His fullness.<p><b>dwell in Him</b><br>The concept of dwelling suggests a permanent and complete presence, not a temporary or partial one. This indicates the incarnation, where the divine nature of God took residence in the person of Jesus Christ. The use of "dwell" echoes the Old Testament tabernacle, where God's presence was among His people (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. This affirms the full deity and humanity of Christ, essential for His role as mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The supreme being, creator, and sustainer of the universe, who is pleased to have His fullness dwell in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, in whom the fullness of God dwells, signifying His divine nature and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae to affirm the supremacy and sufficiency of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the church addressed in this letter was located.

Because Christ embodies the entire divine nature, He can supply every spiritual need (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; No hierarchy exists within the Godhead that places Christ on a lower rung;

The verse establishes Christ&#8217;s full deity, the Father&#8217;s delight in Him, and the incarnation as the true dwelling of God among people. Trusting this truth grounds our faith, assures us of complete provision in Christ, and invites continual worship of the One who is both fully God and fully man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">For it pleased the Father.</span>--(1) The construction is doubtful. There is nothing corresponding to "the Father" in the original. Our rendering involves the supply of the nominative <span class= "ital">God, i.e., </span>"the Father," or <span class= "ital">Christ</span> to the verb, so that the sentence may run, <span class= "ital">the Father</span> or <span class= "ital">Christ determined of His good pleasure that, </span>&c. The supply of the nominative "Christ" is easier grammatically; but it accords ill with the invariable reference of all things, both by our Lord Himself and His Apostles, ultimately to the good pleasure of the Father. Moreover, the verb is so constantly used of God that the supply of the nominative "God," though unexampled, is far from inadmissible. The simplest grammatical construction would, indeed, be to take "the fulness" as the nominative, and render for <span class= "ital">in Him all the fulness </span>(<span class= "ital">of God</span>)<span class= "ital"> was pleased to dwell.</span> But the personification of "the fulness," common in Gnostic speculation, is hardly after the manner of St. Paul. Perhaps, on the whole, the rendering of our version (which is usually adopted) is to be preferred; especially as it suits better with the following verse. (2) The sense is, however, quite clear, and is enforced by <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>, "In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." On the word "fulness" (<span class= "ital">pleroma</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>see Note on <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>. The "fulness of the Godhead" is the essential nature, comprising all the attributes, of Godhead. The indwelling of such Deity in the humanity of Christ is the ground of all His exaltation as the "Head," "the beginning," the "firstborn from the dead," and the triumphant King, on which St. Paul had already dwelt. By it alone can He be the true Mediator between God and man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> For in Him he was pleased that all the fulness should dwell; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[God] was pleased [to have]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#948;&#972;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eudok&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2106.htm">Strong's 2106: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be well-pleased, think it good, be resolved.
