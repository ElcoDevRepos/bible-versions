Faith and love are seen as active responses that stem from the hope believers have in the promises of God. This hope is not a wishful thinking but a confident expectation of eternal life and the fulfillment of God's promises, stored up in heaven. The concept of hope stored in heaven reflects the Jewish understanding of the afterlife and the Christian belief in eternal rewards. It echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a> about storing treasures in heaven. The triad of faith, hope, and love is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>, emphasizing their foundational role in the Christian experience.<p><b>of which you have already heard in the word of truth</b><br>The Colossians had already been introduced to this hope through the "word of truth," which refers to the gospel message. This phrase underscores the importance of the gospel as the true and reliable message of salvation. In a historical context, the early church faced various false teachings, and Paul emphasizes the authenticity and truthfulness of the gospel they received. The term "word of truth" is also used in <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, highlighting the gospel's role in bringing believers to faith. The phrase suggests that the Colossians' understanding of hope is rooted in the teachings they received, which aligns with the apostolic doctrine.<p><b>the gospel</b><br>The gospel, or "good news," is the central message of Christianity, proclaiming the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for the salvation of humanity. In the first-century Greco-Roman world, the term "gospel" was used for announcements of significant events, such as the birth of an emperor. Paul redefines it to convey the transformative message of Christ. The gospel is not just a set of beliefs but a dynamic force that brings about change in individuals and communities. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The gospel's power is evident in its ability to transcend cultural and geographical boundaries, uniting believers in a shared hope and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>- An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the recipients of this letter resided.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>- The community of believers in Colossae who received this epistle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>- The message of salvation through Jesus Christ, which the Colossians had heard and believed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>- The place where the hope of believers is stored, as mentioned in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_hope.htm">The Foundation of Hope</a></b><br>Our hope is not based on earthly circumstances but is securely stored in heaven, providing a firm foundation for our faith and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_gospel.htm">The Role of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel is the word of truth that introduces us to this hope.

When we keep our eyes on the certain inheritance that Christ has reserved for us, our trust in Him deepens and our love for His people overflows&#8212;just as God designed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven.</span>--The union of hope with faith and love is natural enough. Compare the fuller expression of <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm" title="Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;">1Thessalonians 1:3</a>, "your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope." But the place assigned to hope in this passage is notable. "For the hope" is really "on account of the hope." Hence faith and love are spoken of, not merely as leading up to hope, but as being actually kindled by it. Similarly in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> we find that, while faith and love are taken for granted, there is a special prayer that they may be enlightened "to know the hope of His calling" as the one thing yet needful. The prominence given to the thought of "the heavenly places" in the Epistles of the captivity, and therefore to Christ in heaven, even more than to Christ risen, is evident to any careful student. Accordingly, the hope, which is the instinct of perfection in man, and which becomes realisation of heaven in the Christian, naturally comes out with corresponding emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Ye heard before.</span>--That is, at their first conversion. There is an implied warning against the new doctrines, which are more fully noticed in the next chapter.<p><span class= "bld">The truth of the gospel.</span>--This expression (as in <a href="/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a>) is emphatic. It refers to the gospel, not chiefly as a message of graciousness and mercy, but rather as a revelation of eternal truths, itself changeless as the truth it reveals. There is a corresponding emphasis, but stronger still, in St. John. (See, for example, <a href="/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1John 2:27</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-20.htm" title="And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.">1John 5:20</a>; <a href="/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1-4</a>; <a href="/context/3_john/1-2.htm" title="Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.">3John 1:2-3</a>.) The gospel was now winning its way to supremacy over civilised thought. Hence the need of warning against the sudden growth of wild speculations, contrasted with the unchanging simplicity of its main truths. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - (We give thanks) <span class="cmt_word">because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens</span> (<a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20, 21</a>; <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50-58</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13-17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-5</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>; <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2, 3</a>).

Ver. 4 gives the nearest grammatical connection for this clause; and many recent commentators, following Greek interpreters, accordingly find here that which "evokes and conditions" the Colossians' "love" (Meyer, Ellicott) or "faith and love" (De Wette, Lightfoot). But this construction we reject. For it makes the heavenly reward the reason of the Colossians' present (faith and) love, reversing the true and Pauline order of thought (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; comp. <a href="/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17, 18</a>); while, on the other hand, the heavenly hope is the last and highest ground of the apostle's thanksgivings and encouragements, and the forfeiture or impairing of it the chief matter of his fears and warnings throughout the Epistles of this group (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 22, 23, 27, 28</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4, 24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-11.htm">Philippians 3:11-21</a>: comp. <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>). It is better, therefore, with Bengel, Hofmann, Klopper, Conybeare, Eadie, and others, from Athanasius downwards, to refer ver. 5 as well as ver. 4 to the principal verb, "we give thanks" (ver. 3). What the apostle hears of "the faith and love" of the Colossian brethren moves him to give thanks for "the hope which is in store for them in heaven." Of that hope this faith and love are to him a pledge and an earnest, even as the "seal of the Spirit" (<a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>) and the "peace of Christ in their hearts" (<a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; see note) are to themselves. Similarly, in <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:4, 5</a>, from the present faith and patience of the saints the certainty of their future blessedness is argued. By singling out this <span class="accented">hope</span> as chief matter of thanksgiving here, the apostle enhances its certainty and its value in his readers' eyes. (On this verse, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 74-80.) From the <span class="accented">general occasion and ground</span> of his thanksgiving in the Christian state and prospects of his readers, St. Paul proceeds to dwell on certain <span class="accented">special circumstances</span> which enhanced his gratitude to God (vers. 56-8). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (hope) <span class="cmt_word">ye heard of before, in the word of the truth of the gospel;</span> or, <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 7, 23; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 21</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13-15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). There is a veiled polemic reference in "the word of <span class="accented">the truth</span> of the gospel" (comp. ver. 7 and parallels from Galatians). The word "before" (<span class="accented">aforetime</span>) "contrasts their earlier with their later lessons, the true gospel of Epaphras with the false gospel of recent teachers" (Lightfoot). Others interpret, less suitably: <span class="accented">heard already</span> (<span class="accented">before my writing</span>), or <span class="accented">heard beforehand</span> (<span class="accented">before the fulfilment of the hope</span>). It is in St. Paul's manner to refer his readers at the outset to their conversion and first Christian experiences (see parallel passages). Their <span class="accented">hope</span> was directly at stake in the controversy with Colossian error. Here we meet the first of those cumulative combinations of nouns, so marked a feature of the style of Colossians and Ephesians, which are made a reproach against these Epistles by some critics; but each is appropriate in its place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">springing from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
