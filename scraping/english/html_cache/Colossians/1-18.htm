The metaphor of the body emphasizes unity and diversity within the church, with Christ as the guiding force. In <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>, Paul similarly describes Christ as the head over all things for the church, reinforcing His supreme authority. The imagery of the body highlights the interconnectedness of believers, each with different roles and gifts, yet all under the direction of Christ. Historically, the early church faced challenges of division and false teachings, making this assertion of Christ's headship crucial for maintaining doctrinal purity and unity.<p><b>He is the beginning</b><br>This phrase signifies Christ as the origin or source of all creation and the new creation. In <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>, Christ is called the "beginning of God's creation," indicating His preexistence and active role in creation. The term "beginning" also points to His role in the new creation, as believers are made new in Him. This concept is rooted in the Jewish understanding of God as the Creator, now applied to Christ, affirming His divinity and eternal nature.<p><b>and firstborn from among the dead,</b><br>"Firstborn" here refers to Christ's resurrection, marking Him as the first to rise from the dead in a glorified body, never to die again. This term does not imply that He was created but rather denotes His preeminence and authority over all who will be resurrected. In <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>, Paul calls Christ the "firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep," indicating that His resurrection is the guarantee of the future resurrection of believers. The resurrection is central to Christian faith, as it confirms Christ's victory over sin and death, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<p><b>so that in all things He may have preeminence.</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of Christ's resurrection and His role as head of the church: to establish His supremacy in all things. Preeminence means surpassing all others, and this is a key theme in Colossians, where Paul combats false teachings that diminished Christ's divine status. By asserting Christ's preeminence, Paul affirms that He is above all powers, authorities, and creation itself. <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> echoes this, stating that every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. This preeminence is not only a future reality but a present truth, calling believers to recognize and submit to Christ's authority in every aspect of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this verse, described as the head of the church and the firstborn from the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>Referred to as the body of Christ, indicating a close, organic relationship with Jesus as its head.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>Implied event, as Jesus is called the "firstborn from among the dead," highlighting His victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_authority_over_the_church.htm">Christ's Authority Over the Church</a></b><br>Jesus is the head, meaning He has ultimate authority and leadership over the church.

A church&#8212;and a life&#8212;that submits to His leadership, relies on His power, rests in His resurrection, and exalts His name will experience the fullness God intends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18-20) In these verses St. Paul returns from dwelling on the eternal nature of the Son of God to describe Him in His mediatorial office as Son of Man, becoming the "Head" of all humanity, as called into "His Body, the Church." In this he touches on a doctrine more fully developed in the Epistle to the Ephesians. (See <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>.) But still, as has been already noted, there is in this Epistle more stress on the supreme dignity of the Head, as in the other more on the unity, and blessing, and glory of the Body. It should be observed that in this, His mediatorial office, there is throughout a mysterious analogy to His eternal sonship. In both He is "the Head," first, of universal creation, next, of the new creation in His Church; He is "the beginning," in the one case in eternity, in the other in time; He is "the firstborn," now in Eternal Sonship, now in the Resurrection making Him the new life of mankind. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The words, <span class="cmt_word">And he is the Head of the body, the Church</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10, 19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15, 16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-6</a>), identify the mediatorial Lord of creation (vers. 15-17) with the redeeming Head of the Church, and claim the prerogatives belonging to him in the former capacity as the basis of his position and offices in the latter (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>). The Pauline doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ is developed in Colossians and Ephesians, especially in the later Epistle, where it receives its fruitful application. Here the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the doctrine of the Church find their meeting-point as mutually implying each other, and together opposed to the double effect of early Gnosticism, which tended first to lower the dignity of Christ, and then to impair the unity of his Church (see <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, note). In <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a> and <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a> the figure of the <span class="accented">body and members</span> is merely a passing illustration of the mutual relation of believers in the Church; now <span class="accented">the body of Christ</span> becomes the formal title of the Church, expressing the fundamental and fixed conception of its nature as related to him, who is the centre of its unity, the source of all vital energy and directing control within it (comp. the <span class="accented">vine and branches</span>, <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.). In vers. 16, 17 the writer passed from the thought of the origin to that of the constitution of the cosmos; now he proceeds in the reverse order.

As explained by the following words, it denotes, as in philosophical Greek, a <span class="accented">first principle, originating cause, fens et origo</span> (see Lightfoot's note and references).

This is quite consistent with the "all things are of God" of <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; for the apostle is thinking here of the relative, historical beginning of <span class="accented">"the</span> kingdom of the Son" (ver. 13), there of the absolute beginning of the Divine work of redemption (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; and note on "unto him," ver. 16).

The apostle derives the whole life and power of Christianity, whether as seen in Christ or proved by his people, from his resurrection (see parallels). The name <span class="accented">Firstborn</span> brings over with it into this verse the glory which surrounds it in ver. 15. The Divine Firstborn, who is before and over all things, wins his title a second time for his earthly brethren's sake (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10-15</a>). As he appears "out of the dead," born anew from the dark womb of the grave, the nether abyss (<a href="/romans/10-7.htm">Romans 10:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>), the Father declares to him, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>); the Church exclaims," My Lord and my God" (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>); "all authority in heaven and on earth" becomes his (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>); he is made "Firstborn over many brethren," who call him Lord (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>); and proceeds to "subdue all things unto himself" (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).

The purpose of creation as "unto Christ" (ver. 17) had been frustrated, so far as related to man, by the entrance of sin and death, and his rightful pre-eminence denied him (<a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>). He must, therefore, recover it, must <span class="accented">become</span> pre-eminent; and <span class="accented">this</span> he does by his death and resurrection (<a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31, 32</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14, 15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>).
