In the context of Colossians, this refers to Epaphras, a fellow servant and minister of Christ. Paul&#8217;s testimony underscores the importance of personal character and dedication in ministry. It reflects the biblical principle of bearing witness to the truth, as seen in <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, where John the Baptist came as a witness to testify about the light.<p><b>that he goes to great pains for you</b><br>Epaphras is described as laboring fervently for the Colossians, which implies a deep commitment and earnest effort in prayer and ministry. This reflects the biblical theme of intercessory prayer and pastoral care, as seen in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, where the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective. The phrase suggests a model of selfless dedication and love for the church, akin to the sacrificial love of Christ.<p><b>and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis</b><br>Laodicea and Hierapolis were neighboring cities in the Lycus Valley, close to Colossae. This geographical reference highlights the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and the regional nature of Paul&#8217;s ministry. Laodicea is mentioned in <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>, where the church is admonished for being lukewarm, indicating the spiritual challenges faced by these communities. Hierapolis, known for its hot springs, was a center of healing and commerce. The mention of these cities emphasizes the widespread influence and concern of Epaphras&#8217;s ministry, reflecting the Great Commission&#8217;s call to make disciples of all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians.

This isn&#8217;t second-hand rumor; it is the apostle&#8217;s own witness. The same personal commendation appears elsewhere&#8212;&#8220;I commend to you our sister Phoebe&#8221; (<a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1-2</a>) and &#8220;you know Timothy&#8217;s proven worth&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). Scripture records these testimonies so believers will recognize and honor genuine servants of Christ. When Paul vouches for someone, the church can trust that person&#8217;s ministry and message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that he goes to great pains</b><p>Epaphras &#8220;goes to great pains&#8221; (or &#8220;works hard,&#8221; footnote) for the churches. Earlier, Paul noted he is &#8220;always wrestling for you in his prayers&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>). Hard labor for the gospel includes:<p>&#8226; Persistent intercession&#8212;cf. &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Tireless teaching&#8212;cf. &#8220;Let the elders who labor in the word&#8230; be worthy of double honor&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal sacrifice&#8212;cf. Paul himself: &#8220;I worked harder than all of them&#8212;yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).<p>Epaphras models self-denying effort, proving that genuine ministry is costly but Spirit-empowered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you</b><p>The primary recipients are the believers at Colossae. Epaphras planted this church (<a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>) and now agonizes in prayer that they &#8220;stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God&#8221; (4:12). His devotion fulfills Jesus&#8217; command to &#8220;love one another&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>) and echoes Paul&#8217;s own daily &#8220;concern for all the churches&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). Such focused care reminds each congregation that they are not forgotten; God raises servants who labor specifically for their spiritual growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and for those at Laodicea</b><p>Laodicea lay just a few miles from Colossae. Paul already said, &#8220;I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those in Laodicea&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). Epaphras shares that burden. Later, the risen Christ will address Laodicea directly (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>), proving that every assembly&#8212;strong or weak&#8212;remains under His watchful eye. Epaphras&#8217; efforts anticipate that call to renewed zeal, showing that intercessory labor often precedes divine correction and revival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Hierapolis</b><p>Hierapolis completed the tri-city region (Colossae, Laodicea, Hierapolis). Though Scripture says little else about this church, Paul&#8217;s mention ensures we understand that the gospel&#8217;s reach is regional, not merely local. It echoes <a href="/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>, where &#8220;all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord.&#8221; Epaphras refuses to limit his concern to his home assembly; he stretches his prayers to neighboring believers, illustrating <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a> reveals a Spirit-filled laborer commended by an apostle. Paul&#8217;s testimony certifies Epaphras as a trustworthy servant whose costly prayers and efforts embrace not just one fellowship but an entire region. The verse challenges every believer to value such workers, imitate their sacrificial intercession, and recognize that Christ&#8217;s church is broader than our own congregation yet always the focus of God&#8217;s faithful care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) On the natural union of Laodicea and Hierapolis with Colossae, partly local and historical, partly, no doubt, having reference to their conversion by the same instrumentality (of Epaphras), see Note on <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a> and <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span> Epaphras is said to have great "zeal" (properly, <span class= "ital">great labour</span>) of anxiety--finding vent in the wrestling in prayer noted above--for all three cities, for which he evidently still felt himself responsible.

It indicates the deep anxiety of Epaphras for this beloved and endangered Church. There is nothing here to point to "outward toil" (Lightfoot), any more than in <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>. The apostle loves to commend his fellow labourers (<a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20-22, 25, 26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis</span> (vers. 15-17; <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Hierapolis is added to that of Laodicea, singled out in <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a> as a special object of the apostle's concern (on these cities, see Introduction, &sect; 1). Whether Epaphras were the official head of these Churches or not, he could not but be deeply concerned in their welfare.
