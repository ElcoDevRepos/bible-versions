This phrase indicates the importance of transparency and communication in the early church. It reflects Paul's pastoral heart and his commitment to the spiritual well-being of the believers.<p><b>how much I am struggling for you</b><br>The term "struggling" is often associated with the Greek word "agon," which implies a sense of intense effort or conflict, akin to an athlete's struggle in a competition. Paul is emphasizing his dedication and the spiritual warfare he engages in through prayer and teaching for the sake of the Colossians. This struggle is not physical but spiritual, highlighting the importance of intercessory prayer and pastoral care.<p><b>and for those at Laodicea</b><br>Laodicea was a neighboring city to Colossae, part of a tri-city area that included Hierapolis. It was a wealthy city known for its banking, medical school, and textile industry. The mention of Laodicea indicates that Paul's ministry and concerns extended beyond just one congregation, showing the interconnectedness of early Christian communities. This also foreshadows the later message to Laodicea in <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>, where the church is admonished for being lukewarm.<p><b>and for all who have not met me face to face</b><br>Paul's ministry was extensive, and many believers in the early church had not met him personally. This phrase underscores the universal nature of Paul's apostolic mission and the reach of his letters. It also highlights the early church's reliance on written communication to maintain doctrinal unity and encouragement across distances. This aspect of Paul's ministry is a testament to the power of the written word in spreading the Gospel and nurturing faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians.

The reason of that anxiety is found in the "beguiling and enticing words" of an incipient Gnosticism. But "though absent in the body" he rejoices in the steadfastness of their faith, and only exhorts them to continue in it, deepening and enlarging it, but never changing its essence.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">What great conflict.</span>--The word is here repeated from the "striving" of the previous verse, which is, in the original, the cognate verb.

The apostle has dwelt at such length and so earnestly upon his own position and responsibilities (<a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24-29</a>), that the Colossians may feel how real and strong is his interest in their welfare, though personally strangers to him (see next clause). His solicitude for them is in keeping with the toil and strife of his whole ministry. "I would have you know;" a familiar Pauline phrase (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12</a>; <a href="/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>, etc.). <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("how great') has, perhaps, a slightly exclamatory force, as in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5</a> (only other instance of the word in the New Testament), and in classical Greek. For "strife," see note on "striving" (<a href="/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>): the energy and abruptness of language characterizing this second chapter bear witness in the inward wrestling which the Colossian difficulty occasioned in the apostle's mind. (On the close connection of Colossae with Laodicea, comp. <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13-17</a>, notes; also Introduction, &sect; 1.) The danger which had come to a head in Colassae was doubtless threatening its neighbours. The words, <span class="cmt_word">and as many as have not seen my face in</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (ver. 5; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>; <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a>; <a href="/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>), raise the question whether St. Paul had ever visited Colossae. The language of <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see note) raises a strong presumption against his being the founder of this Church, and the narrative of the Acts scarcely admits of any visit to this region in former missionary journeys. Theodoret amongst the Greeks, followed by our own Lardner and a few recent critics, contended that the apostle distinguishes here between Colossians and Laodiceans (or at least the former), and <span class="accented">those who had not seen His face.</span> But the disjunction is grammatically harsh and improbable (see Ellicott). (On the general question, see Introduction, &sect; 2.) The apostle is the more anxious for this endangered Church, as the gifts that his presence might have conveyed (<a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>) were wanting to them. He says, "in flesh," for "in spirit" he is closely united with them (ver. 5; <a href="/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>: comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3, 4</a>).
