The term "alienated" suggests a state of estrangement or separation from God, which is a common theme in Scripture regarding humanity's fallen nature (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>). This alienation is a result of sin, which creates a barrier between humanity and a holy God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). The concept of alienation can be traced back to the Garden of Eden, where Adam and Eve's disobedience led to their separation from God (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>). This estrangement is not just a physical separation but a spiritual one, affecting the relationship and fellowship with God.<p><b>and were hostile in your minds</b><br>The hostility mentioned here refers to an inner attitude of enmity towards God. This mental state is characterized by opposition to God's will and purposes. <a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a> explains that the mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God and does not submit to His law. This hostility is not merely passive but active, as it involves a deliberate rejection of God's authority and truth. The cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, with its pantheon of gods and philosophical ideas, often led to a mindset that was contrary to the monotheistic and moral teachings of Christianity. This mental hostility is a universal condition of humanity apart from Christ, as seen in the rebellious nature of the Israelites in the Old Testament (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>).<p><b>engaging in evil deeds</b><br>This phrase indicates that the internal hostility towards God manifests in outward actions. Evil deeds are the natural outcome of a mind set against God, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, which lists the acts of the sinful nature. The historical context of Colossae, a city influenced by various religious and philosophical systems, likely included practices that were contrary to Christian ethics. The Bible consistently teaches that evil actions stem from the heart (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>), and without the transformative power of Christ, individuals remain in bondage to sin. The mention of "evil deeds" serves as a reminder of the need for redemption and the transformative work of Christ, who enables believers to live in righteousness (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to the church in Colossae to address theological issues and encourage believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where the church addressed in this letter was located.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a group of early Christians facing challenges from false teachings and needing encouragement in their faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure from whom humanity was alienated due to sin, but who offers reconciliation through Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Though not mentioned directly in this verse, He is the means of reconciliation and the central figure in the surrounding context of the passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_alienation.htm">Understanding Alienation</a></b><br>Recognize that alienation from God is a result of sin and hostility in our minds.

The combination of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("being") with perfect passive participle ("having been alienated") implies a fixed condition, that has become as a part of one's nature (so in <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, Revised Text). As the opposite of "reconciled," "alienated" is strictly passive, and denotes, not a subjective feeling on the part of the sinner, but an objective determination on the part of God, an exclusion from the Divine favour, from "the kingdom of the Son" and "the lot of the saints" (vers. 12, 13; <a href="/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3, 11-13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>: comp. usage of LXX in <a href="/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9; 1</a> Esdr. 9:4; Sir. 11:34). "Enemies in your thought" sets forth the disposition of the sinner towards God (<a href="/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>: so Alford,Ellicott, Lightfoot). Meyer maintains the passive sense of "enemies," as found in <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>. On the latter view, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> is instrumental dative, "by," "in virtue of your state of mind;" on the former, it is dative of reference or definition. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (here only and <a href="/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a> and Ephesians 4:18 in St. Paul) has possibly a polemical reference. It denotes in Greek philosophy, the faculty of <span class="accented">thought</span>, as opposed to the bodily powers. In Philo's teaching it signifies the higher part of human nature, akin to God, and opposed to evil which belongs to the senses: "Thought (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the best thing in us" ('On Fugitives,' &sect; 26); "Every man in regard to his intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is united to the Divine Word, being an impression or fragment or ray of that blessed nature; but in respect of his body he belongs to the entire world" ('On the Creation of the World,' &sect; 51). But here sin is associated With <span class="accented">the intellect in</span> man, and redemption with "the body of Christ's flesh" (ver. 22): comp. notes on "reason," <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, and "body," <a href="/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; also <a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where <span class="accented">the reason</span> is vain, <span class="accented">the intellect</span> darkened. "Wicked [emphasized by its position in the Greek, denoting <span class="accented">active</span> evil; see Trench's 'Synonyms,' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>] works" is a phrase common in St. John, only used here by St. Paul (comp. <a href="/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). These <span class="accented">works</span> are the practices of life in which the sinner is abidingly excluded from "the kingdom of Christ and God" (<a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and manifests the radical antipathy of his mind toward God. "Yet [or, 'but'] now:" comp. ver. 26; <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc. - a lively form of transition characteristic of St. Paul, primarily temporal, then also logical in sense. "Were ye reconciled" breaks through the grammatical structure of the sentence, as in vers. 26, 27 (see Lightfoot, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 717). If "did he reconcile" (or, "hath he reconciled") be the correct reading, "Christ" is still subject of the verb, as in vers. 19-22, and consistently with <a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>.
