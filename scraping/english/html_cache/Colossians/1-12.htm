Thanksgiving is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, highlighting a posture of humility and recognition of God's sovereignty and grace. In the cultural context of the early church, thanksgiving was not only a personal expression but also a communal practice, reflecting the unity and shared faith of the Christian community. The Father is acknowledged as the source of all blessings, aligning with the Jewish tradition of recognizing God as the provider and sustainer.<p><b>who has qualified you</b><br>The concept of being "qualified" suggests a transformation or change in status. In the Greco-Roman world, qualifications were often associated with citizenship or rights, which were not easily obtained. Spiritually, this qualification is not based on human merit but on divine grace. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God choosing and enabling His people, as seen in the stories of Israel and the calling of the apostles. It underscores the idea that believers are made worthy through Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>to share in the inheritance</b><br>Inheritance language is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where it often refers to the Promised Land given to Israel. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include the spiritual blessings and eternal life promised to believers. The inheritance is not just a future hope but a present reality, as believers are already part of God's kingdom. This reflects the eschatological tension of the "already but not yet" in Christian theology, where the kingdom is both present and future.<p><b>of the saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those set apart for God, a designation for all believers, not just a select few. In the early church, this term emphasized the holiness and distinctiveness of the Christian community. It connects to the Old Testament idea of Israel as a holy nation and a kingdom of priests. The saints are those who have been sanctified by faith in Christ, living in a way that reflects their new identity.<p><b>in the light</b><br>Light is a powerful biblical metaphor for truth, purity, and divine revelation. It contrasts with darkness, symbolizing ignorance, sin, and separation from God. In the cultural context of the time, light was often associated with knowledge and enlightenment. Biblically, Jesus is described as the "light of the world," and believers are called to walk in the light, reflecting His character. This phrase underscores the transformation from darkness to light that occurs through salvation, aligning with the prophetic imagery found in Isaiah and the writings of John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, who is the source of all blessings and the one who qualifies believers for their inheritance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Believers in Christ who are set apart for God's purposes.

And who is sufficient for these things?">2Corinthians 2:16</a>), "Who is sufficient for these things?"

The "lot" (like the Old Testament type of the share in the land of Canaan," the lot of their inheritance") is the place assigned to the saints primarily by the grace of God. It may have, as in the case of the type, to be fought for; but it is won not by our own arm, but by "God's hand and His arm, and the light of His countenance, because He has a favour unto us" (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm" title="For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, because you had a favor to them.">Psalm 44:3</a>). Hence, in accordance with St. Paul's usual teaching (especially emphatic in this and the Ephesian Epistle), the whole stress is laid on God's grace, giving us our lot, and "making us meet" to accept it. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Giving thanks to the Father, who made us</span> (or, <span class="accented">you</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>meet for our</span> (or, <span class="accented">your</span>) <span class="cmt_word">share in the lot</span> (or, <span class="accented">portion</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the saints in the light</span> (vers. 3-5; <a href="/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 11-14</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>; <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>).

This <span class="accented">meetness</span>, already conferred on the Colossians, consists in their forgiveness (ver. 14) and adoption (<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5-7</a>), which qualify and entitle them to receive the blessings of Christ's kingdom (ver. 13; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 2</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5, 6</a>; <a href="/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>), and which anticipate and form the basis of that worthiness of character and fitness of condition in which they are finally to be presented "perfect in Christ" (vers. 10, 22, 28; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23, 24</a>); "not <span class="accented">qui dignos fecit</span> (Vulgate), but <span class="accented">qui idoneos fecit"</span> (Ellicott). "Called and (made us meet)" is one of the few characteristic readings of the great Vatican Manuscript, which Westcott and Herr reject (see their 'Introduction,' &sect; 320, and Lightfoot's 'Detached Notes,' p. 251). "The lot of the saints" is that entire wealth of blessedness laid up for the people of God (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-7</a>), in which each has his due <span class="accented">share</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> (Meyer, Ellicott, Lightfoot, less suitably: "parcel of (consisting in) the lot"); comp. ver. 28; <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7</a>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("lot," <a href="/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21</a>; <a href="/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>), scarcely distinguishable from the more usual <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("inheritance," <a href="/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>, etc.; <a href="/acts/20-32.htm">Acts 20:32</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), is used in the Old Testament (LXX) of the sacred land as "divided by lot," and as "the lot" assigned to Israel (<a href="/numbers/34-13.htm">Numbers 34:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>, etc.), also of Jehovah himself as "the lot" of the landless Levites (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>), and of Israel in turn as "the lot" of Jehovah (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>).
