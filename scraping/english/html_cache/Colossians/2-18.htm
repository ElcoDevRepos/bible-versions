In the context of the early church, some individuals practiced asceticism, believing that self-denial and extreme humility would bring them closer to God. However, this false humility was often a facade for spiritual pride. The Bible frequently warns against outward displays of piety that do not reflect the heart (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-18</a>). True humility is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is characterized by a sincere dependence on God.<p><b>and the worship of angels</b><br>The worship of angels was a heretical practice that infiltrated the Colossian church. This practice may have been influenced by local pagan religions or a misunderstanding of Jewish traditions, where angels were sometimes revered as messengers of God. However, Scripture is clear that worship is due to God alone (<a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10, 22</a>:8-9). The elevation of angels to a status of worship detracts from the supremacy of Christ, who is the head of all principality and power (<a href="/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>).<p><b>disqualify you with speculation about what he has seen</b><br>The term "disqualify" suggests being judged unworthy or losing a reward. In the context of the Colossian church, some individuals claimed special visions or mystical experiences as a basis for spiritual authority. These claims were speculative and not grounded in the truth of the Gospel. The Bible cautions against relying on personal revelations that contradict Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a>). True spiritual insight comes from the Holy Spirit and aligns with God's Word (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-16</a>).<p><b>Such a person is puffed up without basis by his unspiritual mind</b><br>This phrase describes the arrogance and pride of those who rely on their own understanding rather than the wisdom of God. The term "puffed up" indicates an inflated sense of self-importance, which is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). An "unspiritual mind" refers to a mindset that is not led by the Holy Spirit. <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5-8</a> contrasts the mind governed by the flesh with the mind governed by the Spirit, emphasizing the importance of spiritual discernment and humility before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, addressing the church in Colossae with guidance and warnings against false teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Phrygia, Asia Minor, where the church was facing challenges from false teachings and philosophies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals promoting ascetic practices, false humility, and the worship of angels, leading believers away from the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_false_humility.htm">Guard Against False Humility</a></b><br>True humility is rooted in Christ, not in self-imposed practices or asceticism.

The original is, <span class= "ital">willing in humility and worship, </span>and the phrase "willing in" is often used in the LXX. for "delighting in." Other translations are here possible, though not without some harshness. But the true sense is shown beyond all doubt to be that given in our version, by the words used below to describe the same process, "will-worship and humility."<p>In this passage alone in the New Testament "humility "is spoken of with something of the condemnation accorded to it in heathen morality. The reason of this is obvious and instructive. Humility is a grace, of which the very essence is unconsciousness, and which, being itself negative, cannot live, except by resting on some more positive quality, such as faith or love. Whenever it is consciously cultivated and "delighted in, "it loses all its grace; it becomes either unreal, "the pride that apes humility," or it turns to abject slavishness and meanness. Of such depravations Church history is unhappily full.<p><span class= "bld">Worshipping of angels.</span>--This is closely connected with the "voluntary humility" above. The link of connection is supplied by the notice in the ancient interpreters, of the early growth of that unhappy idea, which has always lain at the root of saint-worship and angel-worship in the Church--"that we must be brought near by angels and not by Christ, for that were too high a thing for us" (Chrysostom). With this passage it is obvious to connect the emphasis laid (in Hebrews 1, 2) on the absolute superiority of our Lord to all angels, who are but "ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them who are heirs of salvation;" and the prohibition of angel-worship in <a href="/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>, "See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant . . . worship God." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let no one defraud you of your prize</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 23</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a>). These eight words represent but three in the Greek.

The errorist condemns the Colossian Christian for his neglect of Jewish observances (ver. 16), and warns him that in his present state he will <span class="accented">miss the heavenly prize</span>, "the hope" he had supposed to be "in store for him in heaven" (ver. 5: comp. notes on Colossians 1:5 and Colossians 3:15; also <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delighting in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels</span> (ver. 23; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8, 9</a>; <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17, 18</a>). By these means the false teacher impressed his disciples. His angel worship commended itself as the mark of a devout and humble mind, reverent towards the unseen powers above us, and made purely <span class="accented">Christian</span> worship seem insufficient. "Delighting in" is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> given by Bengel, Hofmann, Lightfoot, Klopper, and is preferable to that of Meyer and Ellicott, who, with several Greek interpreters, supply the sense of the previous verb "desiring (to do so) in lowliness etc.; and to that followed in the Revisers' margin,which puts a sort of adverbial sense on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - "of his mere will, by humility," etc. This latter rendering underlies the paraphrastic" voluntary humility" of the A.V., and agrees with the common interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23 (see note). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is, no doubt, a marked Hebraism, and St. Paul's language is "singularly free from Hebraisms" (compare, however, the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to know</span>, in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; the similar <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is well established, <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). This very idiom is frequently used in the LXX, and occurs in the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,' a Christian writing, of the second century. The apostle may surely be allowed occasionally to have used a Hebraistic phrase, especially when so convenient and expressive as this. Westcott and Hort, with scrupulous purism, mark the reading on this account as doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> ("lowliness of mind"), a word, perhaps, compounded by St. Paul himself (see Trench's 'Synonyms'), is almost confined to the Epistles of this group (comp. ver. 23; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; also <a href="/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). This quality is ascribed <span class="accented">ironically</span> to the false teacher (compare the "puffed up" of the next clause, and for similar irony see <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is "outward worship" or "devotion:" comp. note on ver. 23; elsewhere in New Testament only in <a href="/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> and <a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26, 27</a> (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Worship of the angels" is that <span class="accented">paid to the angels</span>; not "offered by them," as Luther and Hofmann interpret, supposing that the errorists pretended to imitate the worship of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Investigating</span> (or, <span class="accented">dwelling on</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the things which he hath seen'! vainly - being puffed up by 'the reason' of his flesh</span> (<a href="/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l, 7; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). For <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we adopt the sense which it bears in 2 Macc. 2:30; in Philo, 'On the Planting of Noah,' &sect; 19. and in patristic and later Greek generally, viz. "to search into," "examine," "discuss" (see Suicer's 'Thesaurus'). The rendering "proceeding" or "dwelling on," though near the radical sense of the word ("to step on" or "in"), wants lexical support. The same may be said of the rendering "intruding into," which suits the Received reading, "which he hath <span class="accented">not</span> seen." The "not" of the relative clause is wanting in nearly all our eldest and best witnesses, and is cancelled by the Revisers, with Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, etc. Its appearance in two different forms (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) in the documents that present it, makes it still more certain that it is a copyist's insertion. The common reading gives, after all, an unsatisfactory sense; it is not likely the apostle would blame the errorist simply for entering into things beyond his sight (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Meyer, after Steiger and Huther, gives the best explanation of "which he hath seen," supposing the writer to allude ironically to <span class="accented">pretended visions</span> of angels or of the spiritual world, by which the false teacher sought to impose on the Colossians. This view is suggested by Tertullian in the passage cited under ver. 16. Such visions would be suitable for the purpose of the errorist, and congenial to the Phrygian temperament, with its tendency to mysticism and ecstasy (see Theodoret, quoted under ver. 15, who also says that <span class="accented">angel worship</span> was specially forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, A.n. 364). If the false teacher were accustomed to say with an imposing air, "I have seen, ah! I have seen!" in referring to his revelations, the apostle's allusion would be obvious and telling. The language of <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> (R.V.) suggests a similar reliance on supernatural visions on the part of the apostle's earlier opponents. This pretentious visionary is, however, a "philosopher" and a "reasoner" first of all (vers. 4, 8). Accordingly he <span class="accented">investigates what he has seen</span>; inquires into the import of his visions, rationally develops their principles, and deduces their consequences. So far, the apostle continues in the ironical vein in which the first words of the verse are written, setting forth the pretensions of his opponent in his own terms, his irony "restraining itself till, after the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the indignation of truth breaks forth from it" (Steiger) in the caustic and decisive "vainly." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> qualifies the foregoing participle (so Origen, apparently, in Cramer's 'Catena,' vol. 4. p. 69; Steiger, De Wette, Hofmann, Conybeare) more suitably than the following. Thus it signifies "idly," "to no purpose," as everywhere else in St. Paul (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>); not "without cause," as joined to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("puffed up"), whose 'force it could only weaken. "Vainly" stigmatizes the futility, "puffed up" the conceit, and "by the reason of his flesh" the low and sensuous origin of these vaunted revelations and of the high-flown theosophy which they were used to support. (For the sarcastic force of "puffed up," comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The "reason" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) is, in Greek philosophy, the philosophical faculty, the power of supersensible intuition; and in Plato and Philo, the organ of the higher, mystical knowledge of Divine things (see Philo, 'Who is Heir of Divine Things?' &sect;&sect; 13, 20, and <span class="accented">passim</span>). The Colossian "philosopher" (ver. 8) would, we may imagine, speak of himself as "borne aloft" in his visions "by heavenly reason," "lifted high in angelical communion," or the like. Hence the apostle's sarcasm, "Exalted are they? say rather, <span class="accented">inflated: lifted high by Divine reason?</span> nay, but <span class="accented">swollen high by the reason of their flesh."</span> Some such allusion to the language of the errorists best accounts for the paradoxical <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Lightfoot); contrast with <a href="/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, and compare the disparaging reference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">Colossians</span> 1:21 (note).
