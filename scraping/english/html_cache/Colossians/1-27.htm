The "them" refers to the saints, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, indicating that God has chosen to reveal His mysteries to His people. This aligns with the biblical theme of God choosing to reveal Himself and His purposes to humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>. The act of making known underscores the idea of divine revelation, which is central to understanding God's interaction with humanity throughout Scripture.<p><b>among the Gentiles</b><br>The inclusion of the Gentiles in God's plan of salvation was a revolutionary concept in the early church. Historically, the Jewish people were seen as God's chosen nation, but the New Testament reveals the expansion of this covenant to include all nations. This is consistent with the Abrahamic promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where all families of the earth would be blessed through Abraham. The Apostle Paul, the author of Colossians, was particularly called to be an apostle to the Gentiles (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), highlighting the fulfillment of God's inclusive plan.<p><b>the glorious riches of this mystery</b><br>The term "mystery" in the New Testament often refers to a divine truth that was previously hidden but is now revealed. The "glorious riches" suggest the abundant and valuable nature of this revelation. In the context of Colossians, the mystery pertains to the inclusion of the Gentiles and the indwelling of Christ. This mystery is not only a theological concept but also a transformative reality for believers, as it signifies the wealth of spiritual blessings available in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p><b>which is Christ in you</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the heart of the Christian faith: the indwelling presence of Christ in the believer. It signifies a personal and intimate relationship with Jesus, transcending cultural and religious boundaries. Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of union with Christ, where believers are spiritually united with Him (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). This indwelling is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people.<p><b>the hope of glory</b><br>"Hope" in the biblical sense is a confident expectation, not mere wishful thinking. The "glory" refers to the future state of believers, sharing in the divine glory of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). This hope is both a present reality and a future promise, providing assurance and motivation for holy living. The concept of glory is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where it often signifies God's manifest presence (<a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>). In the New Testament, believers are promised a share in this glory through their union with Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who reveals His mysteries to humanity, specifically choosing to make known His plan to the Gentiles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people who are recipients of the mystery of Christ, highlighting the inclusivity of the Gospel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose indwelling presence in believers is the hope of glory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, emphasizing the mystery of Christ to the Gentiles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>The city where the recipients of the letter resided, a place where the early church was growing amidst various cultural influences.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_mystery_revealed.htm">The Mystery Revealed</a></b><br>The "mystery" refers to God's plan of salvation through Christ, now revealed to all, including the Gentiles.

Here the mystery itself is boldly defined as "Christ in you;" just as in <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1Timothy 3:16</a>, according to one interpretation of that difficult passage, "the mystery of godliness" is Christ Himself, "who was manifest," &c. Here we have again a significant illustration of the difference between the characteristic ideas of the two Epistles. In the Ephesian Epistle the unity of all in God's covenant is first put forth, and then explained as dependent on the indwelling of Christ in the heart. Here the "Christ in you" is all in all: the unity of all men in Him is an inference, but one which the readers of the Epistle are left to draw for themselves. On the great idea itself, in the purely individual relation, see <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>, and also <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; in the more general form, see <a href="/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

There is no need to seek a reference to <span class="accented">free grace</span> in the verb "willed;" the two ideas are concurrent, but distinct (see, however, Lightfoot). The apostle's mind is filled with amazement as he contemplates the boundless <span class="accented">riches</span> which the salvation of the Gentiles revealed in God himself (comp. <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>). "The glory of this mystery" is the splendour with which it invests the Divine character (on "glory," see note, ver. 11; and for "riches of glory," <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). <span class="accented">Amongst the Gentiles:</span> "semi-local clause, defining the sphere in which the riches of the glory is more specially evinced" (Ellicott). At last this <span class="accented">mystery</span> is defined: <span class="cmt_word">which is Christ in you</span> (<a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>). By a bold metonymy, the <span class="accented">mystery</span> is identified with its subject or content. It is "Christ" himself (see <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, note), the Divine secret of the ages, the burden of all revelation; and "Christ in you" (<a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), Christ dwelling in Gentile carts - this is the wonder of wonders! So the "sinners of the Gentiles" receive "the like [equal] gift" with the heirs of the promises (<a href="/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>). By a further and yet bolder apposition, this mystery of <span class="accented">Christ in Colossian believers</span> is <span class="cmt_word">made one with the hope of glory</span> (vers. 5, 23; <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12-14, 18</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20, 21</a>; <a href="/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), of which it is a pledge and a foretaste (vers. 4, 5; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10-17</a>). This <span class="accented">glory</span> is that which the Christian will wear in his perfected, heavenly state (<a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>), when he will fully reflect the glory he now beholds in God through Christ ("the glory of this mystery"): compare the double "glory" of <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. The rights of the Gentile believer in Christ are therefore complete (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). Possessing him now in his heart, he anticipates all that he will bestow in heaven (on "hope," see ver. 5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to whom</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Dative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="grk">&#920;&#949;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Theos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2316.htm">Strong's 2316: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deity, especially the supreme Divinity; figuratively, a magistrate; by Hebraism, very.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has chosen</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#952;&#941;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;thel&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2309.htm">Strong's 2309: </a> </span><span class="str2">To will, wish, desire, be willing, intend, design. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to make known</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(gn&#333;risai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1107.htm">Strong's 1107: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make known, declare, know, discover.
