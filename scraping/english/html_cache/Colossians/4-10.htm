He is mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> as being seized during the riot in Ephesus, showing his dedication to the ministry. His presence with Paul in prison indicates his willingness to suffer for the Gospel. This phrase highlights the close bonds formed through shared trials and the importance of fellowship among believers. Aristarchus's role as a "fellow prisoner" suggests he was either imprisoned with Paul or voluntarily stayed with him to provide support, reflecting the early Christian commitment to community and mutual support.<p><b>as does Mark the cousin of Barnabas</b><br>Mark, also known as John Mark, is a significant figure in the New Testament. He is the author of the Gospel of Mark and was initially a companion of Paul and Barnabas on their missionary journeys (<a href="/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>). However, he left them during the first journey, leading to a disagreement between Paul and Barnabas (<a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>). This mention in Colossians indicates a reconciliation between Paul and Mark, demonstrating the power of forgiveness and restoration in Christian relationships. Mark's connection to Barnabas, a prominent leader in the early church known for his encouragement (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), underscores the importance of family ties and mentorship in ministry.<p><b>You have already received instructions about him</b><br>This phrase suggests that the Colossian church had prior communication regarding Mark. It implies that Paul had given specific guidance on how to interact with him, possibly addressing any lingering concerns from his earlier departure. This reflects the structured nature of early church leadership and the importance of following apostolic guidance. It also highlights the need for clear communication and the resolution of past conflicts within the church community.<p><b>If he comes to you, welcome him</b><br>Paul's instruction to welcome Mark emphasizes the theme of hospitality and acceptance within the Christian community. It serves as a directive to the Colossians to embrace Mark despite any past issues, reinforcing the message of grace and reconciliation. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on welcoming one another as Christ has welcomed us (<a href="/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). The instruction also reflects the itinerant nature of early Christian ministry, where leaders and teachers often traveled between churches, relying on the hospitality of fellow believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aristarchus.htm">Aristarchus</a></b><br>A fellow prisoner with Paul, Aristarchus was a Macedonian from Thessalonica who accompanied Paul on his missionary journeys.

When, after two years' captivity, the Apostle starts from Caesarea on his voyage to Rome, Aristarchus is again named by St. Luke as "being with us" (<a href="/acts/27-2.htm" title="And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.">Acts 27:2</a>). From this fact, and from his being called here "my fellow-prisoner" (a name which there seems no adequate reason to consider as metaphorical), it would appear that, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, Aristarchus really shared his captivity. It is certainly not a little curious that in the Epistle to Philemon (<a href="/context/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23-24</a>), sent at the same time, it is Epaphras who is called the fellow-prisoner," while Aristarchus is simply classed among the fellow-labourers." This variation is interesting to us as one of the characteristic marks of independence and genuineness in the Epistles; but it can only be accounted for by mere conjecture, such as that of their alternately sharing the Apostle's captivity.<p><span class= "bld">Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas.</span>--The notices of John Mark in the New Testament are full of interest. This is the first notice of him since the day when St. Paul rejected him from his function of "ministration," because on the former journey he had "deserted" them at Perga, and had "not gone with them to the work" (<a href="/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>). Then he had gone with Barnabas to Cyprus, to take part in an easier work, nearer home and under the kindly guardianship of his uncle. Now the formal charge to the Colossian Church to "receive him"--a kind of "letter of commendation" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>)--evidently shows that they had known of him as under St. Paul's displeasure, and were now to learn that he had seen reason to restore him to his confidence. In the Epistle to Philemon Mark is named, as of course (<a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>), among his "fellow-labourers." In St. Paul's last Epistle, written almost with a dying hand (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), there is a touch of peculiar pathos in the charge which he, left alone in prison with his old companion St. Luke, gives to Timothy to bring Mark, as now being right serviceable for the "ministration" from which he had once rejected him. Evidently St. Paul's old rebuke had done its work, and, if Mark did join him in his last hours, he probably thanked him for nothing so much as for the loving sternness of days gone by. Before this, if (as seems likely) he is the "Marcus, my son" of <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>, he was with St. Peter, and must be identified with St. Mark the Evangelist, subsequently, as tradition has it, bishop and martyr at Alexandria. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you</span> (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2, 23</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>; <a href="/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>).

The supposition that these men were permitted as friends to share St. Paul's captivity in turn, is conjectural (see Meyer). Possibly the incident recorded in <a href="/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> was attended by some temporary joint imprisonment of St. Paul and Aristarchus. As "a soldier of Christ Jesus," the apostle was himself now "a prisoner of war" (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</a>); and therefore those who shared his sufferings were his "fellow prisoners," as they were his" fellow soldiers" (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>) and his "fellow servants" (<a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you received commandments - if he should come to you, welcome him</span> (<a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>). It is pleasant to find John Mark, who deserted the apostle in his first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>), and on whose account he separated from Barnabas (<a href="/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-40</a>) ten years before, now taken again into his confidence and friendship (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). And indeed it is evident that there was no permanent estrangement between the two great Gentile missionaries; for Mark is called "cousin of Barnabas" by way of recommendation (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 9, 13</a>). Mary, the mother of John Mark, was a person of some consideration in the Church at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>), and through her he may have been related to Barnabas, who, though a Cypriot Jew, had property near Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36, 37</a>), and was also highly honoured by the mother Church (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22-24</a>; <a href="/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25, 26</a>). Mark is, moreover, a link between the Apostles Paul and Peter. It is to the house of his mother that the latter betakes himself on his escape from Herod's prison (<a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>). In <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a> he appears, along with Silvanus (Silos), St. Paul's old comrade, in St. Peter's company, who calls him "my son." St. Peter was then at Babylon, where Mark may have arrived at the end of the journey eastwards which St. Paul here contemplates his undertaking. The striking correspondence of language and thought between St. Peter's First Epistle (addressed, moreover, to Churches of Asia Minor) and those of St. Paul to the Ephesians and Colossians (and, in an equal degree, that to the Romans) suggests the existence of some special connection at this time between the two writers, such as may well have been afforded by Mark, if, leaving Rome soon after the despatch of these letters, he travelled in their track by way of Asia Minor to join St. Peter at Babylon. At the time of St. Paul's second imprisonment, about four years later, Mark is again in Asia Minor in the neighbourhood of Timothy, and the apostle desires his services at Rome (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). When or how the Colossians had received already directions concerning Mark, we have no means of knowing. His journey appears to have been postponed. The apostle must before this have communicated with the Colossians. The visit of Epaphras to Rome may have been due to some communication from him. "If he should come to you, give him a welcome," is the request the apostle now makes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">My</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
