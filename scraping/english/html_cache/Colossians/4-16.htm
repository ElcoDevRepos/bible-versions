This practice highlights the early church's reliance on oral tradition and public reading due to limited access to written texts. The letter to the Colossians was intended to be read aloud to ensure that all members, regardless of literacy, could hear and understand the teachings. This reflects the communal nature of early Christian worship and the importance of shared doctrine.<p><b>make sure that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans</b><br>Laodicea was a neighboring city to Colossae, located in the Lycus Valley in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). The instruction to share the letter with the Laodiceans underscores the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and the universal applicability of Paul's teachings. It also suggests that the issues addressed in the letter were relevant to multiple congregations. This practice of circulating letters helped to maintain doctrinal unity and encouraged mutual support among the early churches.<p><b>and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea</b><br>The reference to a letter from Laodicea, which is not extant, indicates that Paul wrote other letters that were not preserved in the New Testament canon. This highlights the broader scope of Paul's ministry and the possibility of other teachings and instructions that were shared among the early churches. The exchange of letters between congregations suggests a network of communication and collaboration, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose. This practice also points to the early church's recognition of the authority of apostolic writings, which were considered vital for instruction and edification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Colossians, providing guidance and instruction to the early church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossians.htm">Colossians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in the city of Colossae.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/laodiceans.htm">Laodiceans</a></b><br>Another Christian community in the nearby city of Laodicea, also recipients of a letter from Paul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/church_of_laodicea.htm">Church of Laodicea</a></b><br>A neighboring church to Colossae, mentioned in the context of sharing Paul's letters.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/letter_from_laodicea.htm">Letter from Laodicea</a></b><br>A letter written by Paul to the Laodiceans, which is not part of the current biblical canon but was intended to be shared with the Colossians.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture_sharing.htm">The Importance of Scripture Sharing</a></b><br>The early church valued the sharing of apostolic letters, recognizing their authority and the need for communal edification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/interconnectedness_of_the_church.htm">Interconnectedness of the Church</a></b><br>The instruction to share letters between churches highlights the unity and interconnectedness of the body of Christ, transcending local congregations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_scripture_in_spiritual_growth.htm">The Role of Scripture in Spiritual Growth</a></b><br>Regular reading and sharing of Scripture are vital for spiritual growth, correction, and encouragement within the church community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_apostolic_teaching.htm">The Authority of Apostolic Teaching</a></b><br>Paul's letters were considered authoritative and essential for guiding the early church, a principle that remains relevant for contemporary believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_to_seek_wisdom.htm">Encouragement to Seek Wisdom</a></b><br>Engaging with Scripture from different perspectives and communities can provide a broader understanding and deeper wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Colossians_4_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Colossians 4:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ensure_Colossians_4_16_in_church.htm">How can we ensure Colossians 4:16 is practiced in our church community?

Scripture is to be shared, heard, and obeyed together, uniting believers in one truth that equips the whole body of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">When this epistle.</span>--In the implied direction to read this Epistle in the Church--a direction expressly given under like circumstances to the Church at Thessalonica (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm" title="I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.">1Thessalonians 5:27</a>)--we discern the method of first publication of the Apostolic Epistles; in the direction to interchange Epistles with the Laodicean Church, we trace the way in which these Epistles became more widely diffused, and recognised as authoritative in the Church at large. Thus it was that they were "canonised," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>accepted as a part of the "canon" or rule of divine truth. The likelihood, or unlikelihood, of this public reading has an important bearing on the question of the authenticity of some of the books, which were placed among the "doubtful" by Eusebius and other ancient authorities. The fact that other books (such as our so-called Apocryphal books) were also publicly read was the cause of their being wrongly confused with the books of Holy Scripture.<p><span class= "bld">The epistle from Laodicea.</span>--The question, What was this "Epistle from Laodicea"? has given birth to a crowd of conjectures, of which an admirable and exhaustive examination will be found in Dr. Lightfoot's <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on this verse. But many of these may be at once dismissed. It seems perfectly clear, from the obvious parallelism of this Epistle from Laodicea with the Epistle to the Colossians itself, that it was a letter not from the Laodicean Church, not from any other Apostle, or Apostolic writer, but from St. Paul himself, either written at Laodicea, or (as is more likely) written to the Laodicean Church, and to be sent "from Laodicea" to Colossae. Hence the question is narrowed to a single alternative--(1) Is it an Epistle which has been lost, or, at any rate, not found in the canon? This is, of course, possible; it cannot be necessary, as it is certainly difficult, to suppose that all St. Paul's Epistles have been preserved to us in Holy Scripture. Now, there is extant an "Epistle to the Laodiceans," circulated in the West, and known only in the Latin, although it has been thought to bear traces of translation from a Greek original. This letter (for which see <span class= "ital">Excursus B.</span>) is obviously a forgery, probably not of early date, being little more than a tame compilation of phrases from St. Paul's Epistles. Putting this unhesitatingly aside, we may suppose the letter to have been lost. But this is a supposition merely arbitrary, and not to be adopted, except in default of something which has a better claim to attention. (2) Is it some other of St. Paul's known Epistles? The only letter which is noticed in our ordinary copies of the Greek Testament as written from Laodicea is the First Epistle to Timothy; but this is put out of the question, both in date and character; and, moreover, the very idea of a letter written from Laodicea at this time is negatived by St. Paul's declaration (<a href="/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>) that the Laodiceans had not seen his face in the flesh. A fourth century tradition declares our "Epistle to the Hebrews" to have been written to the Laodiceans; but (setting aside all question of the authorship) the whole character and argument of the Epistle make this extremely unlikely. Far the most probable supposition identifies it with our "Epistle to the Ephesians." For the reasons for supposing this an encyclical letter, see <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> to that Epistle. In particular it should not be forgotten that Marcion expressly calls it an "Epistle to the Laodiceans." Laodicea lay lower down the valley, and was the larger town: an encyclical letter might well be left there to be sent on to Colossae. The two Epistles, as we have seen, have both strong likeness and marked distinction. Nothing could be more natural than that they should be interchanged, according to the direction of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when this letter has been read among you, see to it</span> (literally, <span class="accented">cause</span>) <span class="cmt_word">that it be read also in the Church of</span> (the) <span class="cmt_word">Laodiceans</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>). For these two Churches were closely allied in origin and condition, as well as by situation and acquaintanceship (<a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). The leaven of the Colossian error was doubtless beginning to work in Laodicea also. The words addressed to Laodicea in the Apocalypse (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>) bear reference apparently to the language of this Epistle (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-18</a>); see Lightfoot, pp. 41, etc. The phrase, "Church of Laodiceans," corresponds to that used in the salutation of 1 and 2 Thessalonians, but is not found elsewhere in St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye also read the letter from Laodicea.</span> What was this letter? Clearly <span class="accented">a letter from St. Paul</span> which would be received at Laodicea, and which the Colossians were to obtain from there. The connection of this sentence with the foregoing, and the absence of any other definition of the words, "the letter (from Laodicea)," make this evident. Nothing further can be affirmed with certainty. But several considerations point to the probability that this missing Epistle is none other than our (so-called) Epistle to the Ephesians. For: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Both letters were sent at the same time, and by the same messenger (<a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The relation between the two is more intimate than exists between any other of St. Paul's writings; they are <span class="accented">twins</span>, the birth of the same crisis in the condition of the Church and in the apostle's own mind.

On the other hand, the main arguments of the Colossian letter are, as it seems, assumed and presupposed in the Ephesian (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a> <span class="accented">b-</span>23, 2:20 <span class="accented">b</span>, 3:8 <span class="accented">b-</span>11, 19 <span class="accented">b</span>, 4:13 <span class="accented">b</span> with <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20, 2</a>:9, 10; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a> with <a href="/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4, 8, 16-23</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x1ff3;</span> in <a href="/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a> are of doubtful authenticity; and there is much in the internal character of that Epistle to favour the hypothesis, proposed by Archbishop Usher, that it was <span class="accented">a circular letter</span>, destined for a number of Churches in Asia Minor, of which Ephesus may have been the first and Laodicea the last (compare the <span class="accented">order</span> of <a href="/revelation/2-3.htm">Revelation 2:3</a>.). In that case a copy of the Ephesian Epistle would be left at Laodicea by Tychicus on his way to Colossae.
