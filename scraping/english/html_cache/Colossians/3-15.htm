This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but a profound sense of well-being and assurance rooted in Christ's redemptive work. In the biblical context, peace (shalom in Hebrew) encompasses completeness and wholeness. The phrase "rule in your hearts" suggests that this peace should act as an umpire or decision-maker in our lives, guiding our thoughts and actions. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>, where the peace of God is said to guard our hearts and minds. Historically, the Colossian church faced false teachings and internal strife, making this exhortation particularly relevant as a call to unity and focus on Christ's teachings.<p><b>for to this you were called</b><br>Believers are called to live in peace as part of their divine vocation. This calling is not just an individual experience but a communal one, reflecting the unity and harmony that should characterize the body of Christ. The concept of being "called" is a recurring theme in the New Testament, emphasizing God's initiative in bringing people into a relationship with Him (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a>). This calling is both a privilege and a responsibility, urging believers to live in a manner worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><b>as members of one body</b><br>The imagery of the church as a body is a powerful metaphor used by Paul to describe the interconnectedness and interdependence of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). Each member has a unique role and function, contributing to the overall health and unity of the body. This metaphor underscores the importance of peace and harmony within the church, as discord can disrupt the body's function. The historical context of the early church, with its diverse membership of Jews and Gentiles, highlights the need for unity amidst diversity.<p><b>And be thankful</b><br>Thankfulness is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, reflecting an attitude of gratitude that should permeate the believer's life. This gratitude is directed towards God for His grace, mercy, and provision. In the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, gratitude was a valued virtue, but Paul elevates it to a spiritual discipline that acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness. <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a> further emphasizes this by instructing believers to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. This attitude of thankfulness fosters a spirit of contentment and joy, reinforcing the peace that should rule in believers' hearts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the recipients of this letter resided.

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>), that which He is (see <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>). The ordinary reading is, no doubt, borrowed from <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm" title="And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.">Philippians 4:7</a>. This verse forms a link between the preceding exhortation to love of man, and the following exhortation to a loving and thankful service of God. The "peace of Christ" is the sense of unity in Him, with our fellow-men and with God. We are "called to it in one Body," of which He is the Head. (Comp. the fuller treatment of this subject in <a href="/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>; where, in accordance with the whole character of that Epistle, the unity "in one Body," here only alluded to, is worked out in vividness and detail.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let the peace of Christ be umpire in your hearts</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14, 20-22</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-18</a>; <a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1, 10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>).

The Greek commentators seem, therefore, to be right, as against most moderns (but see Klopper on the other side), in retaining the primary sense of the verb instead of generalizing it into "rule" or the like. It stands in precise antithesis, both of sense and sound, to <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>: "Let not the deceivers decide against you, but let the peace of Christ decide in your hearts" (Cramer's 'Catena'). "The peace of Christ" dwelling within the heart is to be the security of the Colossian believer against the threats of false teachers: "They seek to rob you of your prize; let this assure you of it." Present, conscious peace with God is a warrant of the Christian's hope of everlasting life (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1-11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31-39</a>; <a href="/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>). This assurance is identical with "the witness of the Spirit" (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15, 16</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). The apostle argued in <a href="/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a> from the present faith and love of his readers to "the hope laid up for them in heaven;" here he bids them find in the peace which Christ has brought to their souls the earnest of their future bliss. It is but a generalizing of the same idea when he speaks in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> of "the peace of God" as "garrisoning the heart and thoughts" against fear and doubt. <span class="cmt_word">Unto which also ye were called, in one body</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12, 18</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14-18, 1-6</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-17.htm">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>; <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>). So this "peace" is to be at once their inward safeguard, and the ground of their outward union. They are to stand together in its defence (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27, 28</a>). Error, which blights the Church's <span class="accented">hope</span>, destroys her unity. So the maintenance of that "one hope of our calling," assured by a Divine peace within the soul, unites all Christian hearts in a common cause (compare the connection of vers. 18 and 19 in <a href="/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>.). With St. Paul, the peace of God's children with him and with each other is so essentially one that he speaks almost indistinguishably of both (<a href="/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He adds, and be ye thankful</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5, 12</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>); viz. "for this assurance of your future blessedness afforded by the peace of Christ within your hearts, with its outward evidence in your Christian unity." The apostle gave thanks for them on like grounds (<a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3-5</a>: comp. 1:12-14). The command <span class="accented">to give thanks</span> prevails in this Epistle, as that <span class="accented">to rejoice</span> in Philippians. "Be" is the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("become"); so in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1, 17</a>. It implies "striving after an aim as not yet realized" (Meyer: comp. <a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>) - rather, therefore, "to be in act," "to prove" or "show one's self thankful" (see Grimm's 'Lexicon;' and comp. <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="/luke/10-36.htm">Luke 10:36</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Let] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
