The word "therefore" connects the reader to the preceding discussion about the believer's union with Christ in His death and resurrection (<a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12-13</a>). Being "raised with Christ" signifies the believer's new life and identity in Him, echoing <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>, where Paul discusses being united with Christ in His resurrection. This concept is central to understanding the believer's spiritual transformation and the call to live in accordance with this new reality.<p><b>strive for the things above</b><br>The call to "strive" suggests an active, ongoing effort to focus on heavenly realities rather than earthly concerns. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He instructs His followers to store up treasures in heaven. The "things above" refer to spiritual values and priorities that reflect God's kingdom, contrasting with the temporal and often sinful nature of earthly pursuits. This exhortation encourages believers to align their thoughts and actions with their heavenly citizenship (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><b>where Christ is seated at the right hand of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the exalted position of Christ, drawing from <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, a messianic prophecy frequently cited in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>). Christ's position at the right hand of God signifies authority, honor, and completion of His redemptive work. It assures believers of His ongoing intercession and sovereign rule (<a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>). The imagery of Christ seated also contrasts with the earthly priesthood, where priests stood to perform their duties, indicating that Christ's sacrificial work is finished (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). This truth provides a foundation for the believer's hope and motivation to pursue a life that reflects their union with the risen and reigning Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, writing to encourage and instruct the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the recipients of this letter resided.

We observe that this celebrated passage occupies a place at the close of the doctrinal portion of the Epistle, exactly corresponding to the even greater passage on the unity of the Church in God in the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1-16</a>). It is unlike that passage, because, summing up the main teaching of this Epistle, it dwells simply on the close personal relation of all souls to God in Jesus Christ, who is at once "the image of God," and the one Mediator between God and man. It is like it (and like other passages of the Epistles of the Captivity) because it passes on from Christ risen to Christ in heaven: it takes for granted our being risen with Christ, and bids us in heart to ascend to heaven now, and look forward to the bliss of heaven in the hereafter.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">If ye then be risen</span> (rather, <span class= "ital">ye rose</span>) <span class= "bld">with Christ.</span>--In these words is marked the beginning of the spiritual life, referred evidently to baptism. (See <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>.) It is a "resurrection with Christ" and in Christ; as such it is dwelt upon in detail in <a href="/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1-14</a>. We may note that this phrase, implying a sudden passing from death unto life, accords more exactly with the idea of adult baptism, accepted in conscious faith, and leading at once to a new life; while the later phrase, "regeneration" (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>), which speaks of the soul as passing, indeed, at once into a new condition, but as having only the undeveloped germ of the new life, corresponds more closely with the idea of the infant baptism, which gradually superseded the other. Here this spiritual resurrection is taken for granted, and the Apostle goes on at once to the next stage of the spiritual life.<p><span class= "bld">Christ.</span>--The name, four times repeated, has in all cases the article prefixed to it. Evidently it used emphatically to refer to our Lord, as our Mediator--our Prophet, Priest, and King. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - SECTION VII. THE TRUE CHRISTIAN LIFE. The apostle, having delivered his attack on the system of error inculcated at Colossae, now passes from the controversial to the more practical purport of his letter. There is no break, however, in the current of his thought; for throughout this chapter he urges the pursuit of a practical Christian life in a sense and in a manner silently opposed to the tendencies of Gnosticizing error. How much more congenial was the task to which he now addresses himself we may judge, perhaps, from the ease and simplicity which mark the language of this chapter, as compared with the abrupt and seemingly embarrassed style of the last section.
