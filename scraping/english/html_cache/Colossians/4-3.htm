This reflects the early Christian practice of intercessory prayer, emphasizing the communal nature of the faith. It highlights the importance of supporting one another through prayer, a theme consistent throughout Paul's letters (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18-19</a>). The request underscores the apostolic mission and the need for divine assistance in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>that God may open to us a door for the word</b><br>The metaphor of an "open door" is used by Paul to signify opportunities for evangelism and the spread of the Gospel (see also <a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>). This phrase suggests reliance on God's sovereignty in creating opportunities for ministry. The imagery of a door implies both access and receptivity, indicating that successful ministry requires divine intervention to prepare hearts and circumstances.<p><b>so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ</b><br>The "mystery of Christ" refers to the previously hidden truth now revealed through the Gospel, that salvation is available to all, Jew and Gentile alike, through Jesus Christ (<a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4-6</a>). This mystery is central to Paul's teaching and is a recurring theme in his epistles. It emphasizes the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Christ.<p><b>for which I am in chains</b><br>Paul's imprisonment is a testament to his commitment to the Gospel. His chains symbolize the cost of discipleship and the reality of persecution faced by early Christians. Despite his physical confinement, Paul views his situation as an opportunity to further the Gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>). His imprisonment in Rome, likely under house arrest, allowed him to continue his ministry through writing and receiving visitors, demonstrating that the Word of God is not bound (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Colossians.

In Ephesians and Romans the apostle implores prayer for <span class="accented">himself</span> alone, and dwells on his personal circumstances. Here and in the Thessalonian letters he unites his fellow labourers with him in the request. <span class="cmt_word">That God may open to us a door for the word</span> (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>).

It is fanciful to give "door" here the sense of "mouth." The "opening of my mouth," in <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>, expresses the subjective freedom (corresponding to "as I ought to speak," ver. 4); "the door for the word," the objective liberty desired by St. Paul in his imprisonment. <span class="cmt_word">To speak the mystery of Christ, because of which also I am bound</span> (<a href="/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23-29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8-10</a>; <a href="/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-24</a>).

(On "mystery," see note, <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>.)

He is in the strange position of an "ambassador in chains" (<a href="/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).
