This reflects the biblical theme of servanthood seen in Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>) and other apostles. The term "servant" (Greek: diakonos) implies a role of service and ministry, aligning with the early church's understanding of leadership as service (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>).<p><b>by the commission God gave me</b><br>Paul's apostleship is divinely appointed, underscoring the authority and legitimacy of his mission. This echoes his conversion and calling on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15-16</a>). The concept of divine commission is central to understanding the apostolic authority and the spread of the Gospel in the early church.<p><b>to fully proclaim to you</b><br>Paul's mission is to deliver the complete message of the Gospel. The phrase suggests thoroughness and dedication to teaching the full counsel of God (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>). This reflects the importance of sound doctrine and the responsibility of church leaders to ensure the congregation receives comprehensive biblical teaching.<p><b>the word of God</b><br>The "word of God" refers to the Gospel message and the teachings of Scripture. In the context of Colossians, it emphasizes the supremacy of Christ and the mystery of the Gospel revealed to the Gentiles (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).

Such an office the apostle holds, along with others (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>), in the Church, "the house of God" (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20</a>: this conception, like that of "the body of Christ" - comp. note on ver. 18 - is fully developed only in the later Epistles). In this office he "administers the gospel" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17, 18</a>), "the grace of God" (<a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>), and here more especially "the mystery" of vers. 26, 27 (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, R.V.). In <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a> and Ephesians 3:2, the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is referred to God himself, the supreme Dispenser in his own house. This office "was given" him, and specifically as "toward the Gentiles" (for "you" points to the Colossians as Gentiles, vers. 24, 27, notes; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 2</a>; <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), when he first became a servant of Christ (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-15</a>; <a href="/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15, 16</a>). Some interpreters connect "to you-ward" with the word "fulfil," but less suitably (comp. <a href="/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To fulfil the word of God</span> (<a href="/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16-19</a>; <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>). "To fulfil" (see vers. 9, 24, and "fulness," ver. 19; also <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>) is either "to complete," to give full development and extension to the gospel message (vers. 5, 6; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>; <a href="/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20, 21, 27</a>); or "to accomplish" the prophetic word (<a href="/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24-26</a>; <a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8 - 12</a>; <a href="/acts/15-15.htm">Acts 15:15-17</a>), as in <a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>, and frequently in the Gospels. This verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, however, is not used by St. Paul elsewhere in the latter sense, and the former precisely suits the context (compare parallels from Romans). Other interpretations - "to preach abundantly," "to continue Christ's preaching" (<a href="/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>), "to execute the Divine commission" - miss the sense of the verb. <span class="accented">The word</span> which it is the object of the apostle's ministry <span class="accented">to fulfil</span>, and in regard to which he had a special stewardship, is none other than - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(eg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
