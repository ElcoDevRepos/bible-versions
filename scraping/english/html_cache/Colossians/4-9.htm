His name means "useful" or "profitable," which is significant given his transformation from a fugitive to a faithful servant. Paul&#8217;s decision to send Onesimus back with Tychicus highlights the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness within the Christian community. This act also reflects the early church's counter-cultural stance on slavery, emphasizing spiritual equality over social status (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>our faithful and beloved brother</b><br>Paul's description of Onesimus as "faithful and beloved" underscores the transformative power of the Gospel. Despite his past, Onesimus is now a trusted member of the Christian community. This phrase emphasizes the Christian principle that one's past does not define their future in Christ. It also reflects the deep bonds of love and fellowship that characterized the early church (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<p><b>who is one of you</b><br>This indicates that Onesimus was a native of Colossae, which would have been significant to the recipients of the letter. It serves as a reminder of the local church's responsibility to accept and restore those who have strayed. This phrase also highlights the unity and inclusivity of the body of Christ, where social and ethnic distinctions are secondary to spiritual kinship (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><b>They will tell you about everything here</b><br>Paul entrusts Tychicus and Onesimus with the task of updating the Colossian church on his circumstances. This reflects the practice of oral communication in the early church, where letters were often accompanied by personal messengers who could provide additional context and encouragement. It also demonstrates Paul's transparency and accountability to the churches he served, fostering a sense of shared mission and community (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/onesimus.htm">Onesimus</a></b><br>A former slave who became a Christian and is described by Paul as a "faithful and beloved brother."
