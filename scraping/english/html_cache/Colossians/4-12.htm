This connection emphasizes the authenticity and personal nature of his concern for them. Epaphras is also mentioned in <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> and <a href="/philemon/1-23.htm">Philemon 1:23</a>, highlighting his role as a faithful minister and fellow prisoner with Paul. His local origin suggests he was instrumental in founding or nurturing the church in Colossae.<p><b>and a servant of Christ Jesus</b><br>The term "servant" (Greek: doulos) implies a deep commitment and submission to Christ, reflecting the early Christian understanding of discipleship as servanthood. This designation aligns Epaphras with other notable figures in the New Testament who are described as servants of Christ, such as Paul (<a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>) and James (<a href="/james/1.htm">James 1:1</a>). It underscores his dedication to the mission and message of Jesus.<p><b>sends you greetings</b><br>This phrase indicates the practice of sending personal greetings in ancient letters, which served to strengthen communal bonds and express mutual care. It reflects the interconnectedness of early Christian communities, despite geographical distances. Such greetings are common in Paul's epistles, as seen in <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/16.htm">1 Corinthians 16</a>.<p><b>He is always wrestling in prayer for you</b><br>The imagery of "wrestling" (Greek: agonizomai) in prayer suggests intense spiritual effort and dedication. This term evokes the idea of struggle and perseverance, akin to an athlete's exertion, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>. It highlights the importance of intercessory prayer in the early church, where leaders and members fervently prayed for one another's spiritual growth and protection.<p><b>so that you may stand mature</b><br>The goal of Epaphras's prayers is the spiritual maturity of the Colossian believers. Maturity (Greek: teleios) implies completeness and perfection in faith, as also emphasized in <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>. This reflects the New Testament's call for believers to grow in their understanding and practice of the faith, moving beyond elementary teachings (<a href="/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a>).<p><b>and fully assured in the full will of God</b><br>Being "fully assured" suggests a deep confidence and conviction in understanding God's will. This assurance is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to be steadfast in their faith. The "full will of God" encompasses His purposes and desires for His people, as revealed through Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of seeking and discerning God's will, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a> and <a href="/ephesians/5-17.htm">Ephesians 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/epaphras.htm">Epaphras</a></b><br>A fellow believer from Colossae, described as a servant of Christ Jesus.

The verse challenges us to value local leaders, labor fervently in prayer, pursue spiritual growth, and rest confidently in the Lord&#8217;s purposes&#8212;just as Scripture, accurate and true, calls every believer to do.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Epaphras.</span>--See Note on <a href="/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Servant of Christ.</span>--A title assumed by St. James and St. Judo, as well as by St. Paul himself, but given by him only to Timothy (<a href="/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>) and to Epaphras here. Of course, all Christians are "servants of Christ."

In the two epithets--perfect and fully established in conviction--we may again trace, as before, reference to the pretensions of the Gnostic teachers to exclusive perfection in wisdom. St. Paul's true fellow-worker, like himself, prays that this perfection may belong to all, and that it may have its basis not is the secrets of heavenly knowledge, but in the revealed "will of God." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Epaphras, who is</span> (one) <span class="cmt_word">of you, saluteth you, a servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of Christ Jesus</span> (<a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>; <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29</a>; <a href="/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="/jude/1.htm">Jude 1</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3, 6</a>).
