This joy is not in the pain itself but in the purpose it serves. Paul&#8217;s sufferings are for the benefit of the Colossian believers, indicating a deep pastoral concern. The early church often faced persecution, and Paul&#8217;s attitude would have been a powerful example to them. His joy reflects a Christ-like perspective, as Jesus also endured suffering for the sake of others (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><b>and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ&#8217;s afflictions</b><br>This phrase does not imply that Christ&#8217;s atoning work was insufficient. Instead, it suggests that the church, as Christ&#8217;s body, continues to experience suffering. Paul sees his own sufferings as part of this ongoing experience. The term "afflictions" here refers to the trials and tribulations faced by believers, not the redemptive suffering of Christ on the cross. Paul&#8217;s sufferings contribute to the mission of the church, aligning with the idea that believers are called to share in Christ&#8217;s sufferings (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>).<p><b>for the sake of His body, which is the church</b><br>The church is described as the body of Christ, a metaphor Paul uses frequently (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>, <a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). This imagery emphasizes unity and interdependence among believers. Paul&#8217;s sufferings are for the church&#8217;s benefit, highlighting his role as a servant-leader. The early church faced external pressures and internal challenges, and Paul&#8217;s dedication to its well-being underscores the importance of sacrificial service. This phrase also points to the church&#8217;s mission to continue Christ&#8217;s work on earth, enduring hardships as part of its calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians.

Paul&#8217;s joy flows from knowing that every bruise advances the gospel, deepens his union with Christ, and strengthens believers. Christ&#8217;s sacrifice lacks nothing for salvation, yet He graciously invites His people to share in the ongoing sufferings appointed for the body, turning pain into spiritual profit until He returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24-29) Here (as in Ephesians 3, in the same connection) St. Paul dwells on his own mission to set forth the universal gospel to the Gentiles. In the Ephesian Epistle this declaration is made a direct introduction to practical exhortation (comp. Col. 4, 5, 6); here it leads up to the earnest remonstrance against speculative errors in Colossians 2, which precedes a similar practical exhortation. In both cases he dwells on the committal to him of a special dispensation; in both he rejoices in suffering as a means of spiritual influence; in both cases he declares the one object to be the presentation of each man perfect before Christ.<p>(24) <span class= "bld">Who now rejoice.</span>--In the true reading of the original there is no relative pronoun. The sentence starts with emphatic abruptness, "Now (at this moment) I rejoice" (just as in <a href="/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2Corinthians 7:9</a>). In all the three Epistles of the Captivity this same rejoicing is declared in himself and urged on his brethren. In <a href="/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, "I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory;" in <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Philippians 2:11</a>, "Yea, if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. For the same cause do ye also joy, and rejoice with me." There, as here, the rejoicing is in suffering, not in itself, not solely because it is borne with and for Christ, but also because it is for the sake of the Church. Here, however, this idea is expressed with far greater emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Fill up that which is behind of the afflictions</span> <span class= "bld">of Christ.</span>--The sense of this passage is at first sight startling, but it could not have been thought difficult or doubtful, had not false inferences from it tempted men to shrink from the obvious meaning. Now, (1) the "afflictions of Christ" is a phrase not used elsewhere; for "affliction" (properly, <span class= "ital">hard and galling pressure</span>) is the ordinary burden of life, and is generally spoken of only as coming on His servants. But, like the common phrase "the sufferings of Christ" (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>), it must moan the afflictions which He endured. It is true, as has been thoughtfully suggested (see Chrysostom and others on the passage) that we are to count as His the afflictions of His Church; but still, even if we are to include these indirect afflictions, we cannot possibly exclude the direct. Next, (2) St. Paul expressly says (in the full force of the original) that "he fills up <span class= "ital">instead"</span> of his Master, what is still left unfinished of his Master's afflictions. (See the passages quoted by Dr. Lightfoot in his note on this verse.) He declares, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that, succeeding to the suffering of Christ, he carries it out for the sake of His body the Church. This is, indeed, nothing but a clearer and more striking expression of the truth conveyed in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>, "The sufferings of Christ overflow to us," so that we bear our part, in addition to the full measure which He bore; and even in the commoner expression, to be "partaker of Christ's sufferings" (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13</a>), or "to drink of His cup and be baptised with His baptism" (<a href="/context/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22-23</a>). But, (3) looking to the meaning and use of the word "afflictions," we note that "the afflictions of Christ" must be His sufferings on earth considered simply as a part--though immeasurably the chief part--of the burden of humanity in a sinful world, They represent, not the Cross of Atonement, on which He alone could suffer--and in which any reader of St. Paul must find it absurd to suppose that he would claim the slightest share--but the Cross of struggle against sin even to death, which He expressly bade us "take up if we would follow Him." This He has still left "behind;" this in His strength every one of His servants bears, partly for himself, partly also for others. In the former light St. Paul says, "The world is crucified to me, and I to the world" (<a href="/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>); in the latter he claims it as his highest privilege "to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for His Body which is the Church." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-29.</span> - SECTION III.
