It was part of a tri-city area with Hierapolis and Colossae. The mention of "brothers" indicates a community of believers, suggesting the spread of Christianity in this region. The church in Laodicea is also addressed in <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>, where it is described as lukewarm, highlighting the need for spiritual fervor. This greeting emphasizes the interconnectedness of early Christian communities and the importance of fellowship.<p><b>as well as Nympha</b><br>Nympha is recognized as a significant figure in the early church, likely a woman of influence and hospitality. The mention of her name suggests her leadership or prominent role within the Christian community. This reflects the broader New Testament theme of women playing vital roles in the early church, as seen with figures like Priscilla (<a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>) and Phoebe (<a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16:1-2</a>). Nympha's inclusion underscores the egalitarian nature of early Christian ministry.<p><b>and the church that meets at her house</b><br>House churches were common in the first century due to the lack of formal church buildings. These gatherings were intimate and fostered close-knit communities. The practice of meeting in homes is seen throughout the New Testament, such as in the homes of Priscilla and Aquila (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>) and Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>). This setting allowed for personal discipleship and communal worship, reflecting the early church's adaptability and resourcefulness.

By instructing greetings to &#8220;the brothers in Laodicea,&#8221; he underscores the real, living bond shared among Christians in different cities.<p>&#8226; This greeting is not mere politeness; it affirms spiritual kinship (see <a href="/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>, &#8220;so in Christ we who are many are one body&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It also safeguards unity across regional churches, echoing <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4&#8211;6</a>, where Paul stresses &#8220;one body and one Spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Laodicea lay only a few miles from Colossae, suggesting practical partnership&#8212;shared letters, prayers, and resources (compare <a href="/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>, where they exchange epistles).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as Nympha</b><p>Naming Nympha highlights the value God places on individual saints, male or female, who serve faithfully.<p>&#8226; Like Phoebe in <a href="/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1&#8211;2</a> and Priscilla in <a href="/acts/18-26.htm">Acts 18:26</a>, Nympha models active ministry.<p>&#8226; Her mention by name shows the Lord&#8217;s personal care (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, &#8220;He calls His own sheep by name&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Paul&#8217;s appreciation teaches us to honor those who labor quietly yet significantly for Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the church that meets at her house</b><p>The phrase reveals how early believers gathered and how God uses ordinary homes for extraordinary purposes.<p>&#8226; House churches were common (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>; Philemon 2), offering warmth, flexibility, and a sense of family.<p>&#8226; Hospitality became a ministry platform (<a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>), turning daily living space into a sanctuary.<p>&#8226; Nympha&#8217;s willingness illustrates stewardship: everything we have belongs to the Lord and is available for His mission (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of &#8220;the church&#8221; meeting there affirms that the true church is the people, not the building (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/colossians/4-15.htm">Colossians 4:15</a> ties together three truths: we are bonded to believers beyond our own address, individual servants matter to God&#8217;s plan, and ordinary homes can host extraordinary kingdom work. Paul&#8217;s brief greeting therefore urges us to value the wider body, honor faithful men and women by name, and open our households for the gospel&#8217;s advance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/colossians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The brethren which are in Laodicea.</span>--The comparison of this phrase with the more general "church of the Laodiceans" below has led to the idea that some special body of Christians--Dr. Lightfoot suggests a "family of Colossian Christians"--at Laodicea is here referred to. But more probably the whole of the Laodicean Christians are meant in both passages. In their individual character they are "the brethren in Laodicea;" when they are gathered to hear the Epistles they are the" Church (literally, <span class= "ital">the Christian assembly</span>) of Laodicea."<p><span class= "bld">And Nymphas.</span>--There is a curious variety of reading here. Some MSS. have, as in our version," the church in his house;" some, "in her house;" the best reading seems to be "in their house." The second of those readings would make the name "Nympha," instead of "Nymphas," with which the form of the original hardly agrees. The last reading (from which the common reading of our version is probably a correction) must refer, in the word "their," to Nymphas and his family. Of Nymphas we know nothing, except from this passage. He is obviously a man of importance, a centre of Church life, in the Christian community at Laodicea.<p><span class= "bld">The church which is in his house.</span>--This phrase is found elsewhere only as applied to "Aquila and Priscilla" (<a href="/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.">1Corinthians 16:19</a>), and to Philemon (<a href="/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a>). Of these Aquila and Priscilla are notable Christian teachers (as of Apostles, <a href="/acts/18-26.htm" title="And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly.">Acts 18:26</a>) and confessors (<a href="/romans/16-4.htm" title="Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.">Romans 16:4</a>); and Philemon is spoken of as a "beloved fellow-labourer," and one in whom "the saints are refreshed" (<a href="/philemon/1-1.htm" title="Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,">Philemon 1:1</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>). Hence this "church in the house" is seen to have gathered only round persons of some mark and leadership. The houses sanctified by such gatherings were the parents of the material churches of the future. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea</span> (ver. 13; <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14-22</a>). Perhaps the brethren in Hierapolis (ver. 13) were not formed into a distinct Church as yet (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1</a>). The Church in Laodicea early became a flourishing and wealthy community (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Nympha</span> (or, <span class="accented">Nymphas</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and the Church</span> (literally, <span class="accented">assembly</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>at her</span> (or, <span class="accented">their</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>house.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> may be either masculine or feminine accusative. The reading "her" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) is adopted by Westcott and Hort without alternative, and seems on the whole the most probable. The Revised Text follows Tischendorf, Tregelles, Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, who read "their" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). "His" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) is evidently a later correction. Lightfoot says, indeed, that "a Doric form of the Greek name (<span class="accented">sc.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) seems in the highest degree improbable;" but he allows, on the other hand, that <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> as a contracted masculine form (for <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) "is very rare." This person was apparently a leading member of the Laodicean Church, at whose house Church meetings were held (comp. <a href="/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="/romans/16-5.htm">Romans 16:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). "The Church at her house" can scarcely have been an assembly distinct "from the brethren that are in Laodicea." Both expressions may relate to the same body of persons, referred first individually, then collectively as a meeting gathered at this place. Others suppose a more private gathering to be meant, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Colossians living at Laodicea (Meyer). Many older interpreters identified this Church with <span class="accented">the household</span> of Nymphas. If "their" be the true reading, the expression must include <span class="accented">Nympha and her family.</span> Nympha (or Nymphas), like Philemon and his family, St. Paul had doubtless met in Ephesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Greet</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#963;&#960;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Aspasasthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Middle - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_782.htm">Strong's 782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To greet, salute, pay my respects to, welcome.
