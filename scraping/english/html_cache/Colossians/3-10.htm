The imagery of "putting on" suggests a deliberate action, akin to changing clothes, symbolizing a departure from the old sinful nature and embracing a new identity in Christ. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, where believers are encouraged to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. The "new self" represents a regenerated nature, aligning with the teachings of Jesus about being born again (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>). This transformation is not merely external but involves a profound internal change, reflecting the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>which is being renewed in knowledge</b><br>The renewal process is ongoing, indicating that spiritual growth and maturity are continuous throughout a believer's life. The term "knowledge" here refers to a deep, experiential understanding of God and His will, rather than mere intellectual assent. This renewal is facilitated by the Holy Spirit and involves a transformation of the mind, as described in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. The Greek word for "knowledge" (epignosis) implies a full, discerned understanding, suggesting that believers are called to grow in their comprehension of divine truths. This aligns with the call to grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><b>in the image of its Creator</b><br>This phrase points back to the original creation of humanity in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The fall of man marred this image, but through Christ, believers are being restored to reflect God's character and attributes. The "image" here is not a physical likeness but a spiritual and moral resemblance to God, emphasizing holiness, righteousness, and love. This restoration process is a fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as believers are conformed to the likeness of His Son (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). The ultimate goal is to reflect Christ's character, as He is the perfect image of the invisible God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Colossians, Paul writes to the church in Colossae to address false teachings and to encourage believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) where the church to whom Paul is writing is located.

New (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is "young," "of recent date" (compare the "once," "but now" of vers. 7, 8; also <a href="/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1, 2</a>). whose birth was well remembered, and which presented so vivid a contrast to the "old man with his deeds." "Being renewed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, derived from the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) sets forth the other side of this newness, its <span class="accented">novelty</span> of quality and condition (compare "newness of life," <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). And this participle is in the present tense (continuous), while the former is in the aorist (historical). So the notions are combined of <span class="accented">a new birth</span> taking place once for all, and a new <span class="accented">character</span> in course of formation. In <a href="/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a> these ideas are in the same order (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Full knowledge" was one purpose of this renewal, the purpose most necessary to be set before the Colossians. The nature and objects of this <span class="accented">knowledge</span> have been already specified (<a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6, 9, 27, 28</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2, 3, 9, 10</a>: comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18, 19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18, 19</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8-14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18-31</a>; and on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, see note, <a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>).

It is adverbial to "renewed," not to "knowledge." Man's renewal in Christ makes him what the Creator at first designed him to be, namely, his own image (compare note on "reconcile," <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).
