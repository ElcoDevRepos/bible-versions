The concept of continuing in faith is a recurring theme in the New Testament, highlighting the importance of steadfastness (<a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>). The conditional "if" suggests that faith is not a one-time event but a lifelong journey. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in the Parable of the Sower (<a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>), where only those who persevere bear fruit.<p><b>established and firm</b><br>The imagery here is architectural, suggesting a strong foundation. This echoes Jesus' parable of the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>), where the wise man builds his house on the rock. The terms "established" and "firm" imply a faith that is deeply rooted and unshakeable, akin to the early church's emphasis on being grounded in apostolic teaching (<a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>).<p><b>not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard</b><br>This phrase underscores the centrality of the gospel message and the hope it brings. The "hope of the gospel" refers to the assurance of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). The warning against being "moved" suggests the presence of false teachings or pressures that could lead believers astray, a concern Paul addresses in other letters (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>).<p><b>which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the universal scope of the gospel message. It reflects the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the early church's mission to spread the gospel to all nations. While not literally fulfilled at the time, it signifies the intent and reach of the apostolic mission, as seen in Paul's extensive missionary journeys (Acts 13-28).<p><b>and of which I, Paul, have become a servant</b><br>Paul identifies himself as a servant of the gospel, highlighting his role as an apostle and missionary. This servanthood is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, where he often refers to himself as a "servant" or "slave" of Christ (<a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). It reflects his commitment to spreading the gospel and his willingness to endure hardships for its sake (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians.

As present indicative, it implies a (supposed) actual state. "The faith," as regularly in the New Testament, is the act and exercise of faith (subjective), not the content or matter of faith (objective). "Grounded" or "founded," perfect passive, implies a fixed condition (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>, coupled with "rooted;" <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; also <a href="/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>).

The words, and not being moved away (or, <span class="accented">letting yourselves be moved away</span>), put the same assumption negatively, and more specifically as he adds, from the hope of the gospel; <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 5, 27; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15, 24</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3, 10</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9-11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13-5:8</a>; <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17-25</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6, 14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35, 36</a>) - that which is its peculiar property and glory, the crown of Christ's redeeming work (ver. 22), the end of his servant's labours (ver. 28), for which, by anticipation, he already gives thanks (ver. 5). but which was directly threatened and brought in question by Colossian error (see notes on Colossians 2:18; 3:15). (<span class="accented">The gospel</span>) which you heard (vers. 5, 7: notes), which was preached in all creation that is under the heaven (ver. 6; <a href="/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). The transition from "you" to "all creation" resembles that of vers. 5, 6 (comp. vers. 20, 21). "Preached" is literally" heralded," "loudly and officially announced;" so, frequently in St. Paul (see <a href="/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>), also in <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. Greek usage does not support the interpretation which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("creation ") equivalent to "humanity." This sense of the word, which, even in Mark, such interpreters as Bengel, Lange, Alford, reject, is quite Hebraistic and exceptional. The phrase, "all creation," the writer has already used in ver. 15; here, as there (see here), without the article (Revised Text). The universal meaning it carries there is now limited by "under the heaven." The <span class="accented">earthly creation</span> subject as it is to Christ, is the sphere of this proclamation, the <span class="accented">preaching room</span> which is to resound everywhere with the glad tidings (comp. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). And with this range it <span class="accented">was proclaimed</span>, for from the first it claimed universal audience. Whereof I became, I Paul, a minister (vers. 24-29; <a href="/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-19</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5, 10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1, 2, 16, 17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 15, 16</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>). (For "minister," see ver. 7.) The later Epistles betray a markedly heightened sense in the apostle of the unique dignity and importance of his own position, and those who question their authenticity press this fact against them. But the difference of tone is what one would expect in "such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus" (<a href="/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>). As the Gentile Churches grew, reverence for his person deepened; and the success of his life mission became more assured, especially now that the struggle with reactionary Judaism, signalized by the Epistles of the third missionary journey, was to a large extent decided in his favour. The false teachers he is now opposing did not, we should gather, attack the apostle personally; but may rather have claimed to be on his side. The movement of thought we have followed in vers. 15-23 proceeds from <span class="accented">Christ's redeeming work</span> to <span class="accented">the experience of the Colossians</span> in receiving it, and <span class="accented">the labours of the apostle</span> in publishing it; and is parallel to that of <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-3:13</a>.
