The addition of "who is called Justus" helps distinguish this individual from Jesus Christ. "Justus" is a Latin name meaning "just" or "righteous," indicating a possible Roman influence or connection. This dual naming reflects the cultural blending in the early church, where Jewish believers often adopted Roman or Greek names. The mention of Justus sending greetings highlights the practice of conveying personal messages in epistles, emphasizing the relational aspect of Paul's ministry.<p><b>These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God,</b><br>Paul notes that Justus, along with others like Aristarchus and Mark, are the only Jewish believers among his co-laborers. This underscores the significant shift in the early church from a predominantly Jewish movement to one that included many Gentiles. The phrase "fellow workers for the kingdom of God" indicates their active role in spreading the Gospel and establishing the church. This collaboration between Jewish and Gentile believers reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the Messiah is a light to the Gentiles, bringing salvation to the ends of the earth.<p><b>and they have been a comfort to me.</b><br>Paul often faced opposition and hardship, both from external sources and within the church. The support and companionship of fellow believers like Justus provided much-needed encouragement. The term "comfort" suggests not only emotional support but also practical assistance in ministry. This reflects the biblical principle of mutual support within the body of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>, where believers are called to comfort one another with the comfort they have received from God. The presence of these Jewish co-workers also highlights the unity and diversity within the early church, serving as a model for Christian fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus (Justus)</a></b><br>A Jewish believer in Christ who worked alongside Paul.
