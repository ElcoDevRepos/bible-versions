The preposition "in" suggests that Christ is the sphere within which creation took place, indicating His preexistence and divine nature. This aligns with <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, which states that all things were made through Him. The concept of Christ as the agent of creation is also found in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, where He is described as the one through whom God made the universe. This underscores the belief in Christ's deity and His integral role in the Godhead.<p><b>things in heaven and on earth</b><br>This phrase encompasses the totality of creation, both the spiritual and physical realms. "Heaven" refers to the spiritual domain, including angels and celestial beings, while "earth" pertains to the physical world. This duality reflects the Jewish understanding of the universe, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth. It highlights the comprehensive scope of Christ's creative work, affirming His authority over all realms.<p><b>visible and invisible</b><br>This distinction further elaborates on the scope of creation, indicating that Christ's creative power extends to both the seen and unseen aspects of the universe. The "visible" includes the material world, while the "invisible" refers to spiritual entities and forces. This mirrors the biblical teaching that there is more to reality than what is perceptible to human senses, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>, which speaks of the eternal nature of the unseen.<p><b>whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities</b><br>These terms refer to various ranks of spiritual beings, often interpreted as angelic hierarchies. In the cultural context of the time, such language would resonate with both Jewish and Greco-Roman audiences familiar with the concept of spiritual powers. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> also mentions these categories, emphasizing the spiritual warfare believers face. This phrase asserts Christ's supremacy over all spiritual powers, countering any belief that elevates angels or other beings above Him.<p><b>All things were created through Him and for Him</b><br>This statement reinforces the idea that Christ is both the agent and the purpose of creation. "Through Him" indicates that He is the means by which creation came into existence, aligning with the prologue of John's Gospel. "For Him" suggests that creation's ultimate purpose is to glorify Christ, reflecting the biblical theme of God's glory as the end goal of all things, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>. This underscores the Christocentric nature of the universe, affirming His preeminence in all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, identified as the agent of creation.

Now we note that in <a href="/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.">Romans 11:36</a>, St. Paul, in a burst of adoration, declares of the Father that "from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things;" and in <a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a> the Father is spoken of as One "by whom are all things, and for whom are all things" (the word "for whom" being different from the word so rendered here, but virtually equivalent to it). Hence we observe that the Apostle here takes up a phrase belonging only to Godhead and usually applied to the Father, and distinctly applies it to Christ, but with the significant change of "from whom" into "in whom." The usual language of holy Scripture as to the Father is "from whom," and as to the Son "through whom," are all things. Thus we have in <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "through whom He made the world;" and in <a href="/context/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3-10</a>, "All things were made"--"the world was made"--"through Him." Here, however, St. Paul twice adds "in whom," just as he had used "in whom" of God in his sermon at Athens (<a href="/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>), probably conveying the idea, foreshadowed in the Old Testament description of the divine "Wisdom," that in His divine mind lay the germ of the creative design and work. and indirectly condemning by anticipation the fancy of incipient Gnosticism, that He was but an inferior emanation or agent of the Supreme God.<p><span class= "bld">In heaven and . . . earth . . .</span>--Here again there is a reiteration of earnest emphasis. "All things in heaven and earth" is the ancient phrase for all creation. Then, lest this phrase should be restricted to the sublunary sphere, he adds, "visible and invisible." Lastly, in accordance with the general tone of these Epistles, and with special reference to the worship of angels introduced into Colossae, he dwells, like the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, on the superiority of our Lord to all angelic natures, whether they be "thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers." (Comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm" title="Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="/context/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9-10</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> For in Him were created all things, <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> In the heavens and on the earth, the things visible and the things invisible - whether thrones, whether lordships, whether principalities, whether dominions - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
