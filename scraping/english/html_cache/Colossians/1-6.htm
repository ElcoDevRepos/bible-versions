This reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' command in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a> to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth." The phrase emphasizes the personal reception of the gospel by the Colossians, highlighting the transformative power of the message of Christ.<p><b>All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing,</b><br>The phrase underscores the universal nature of the gospel, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries. The early church experienced rapid growth, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a> and <a href="/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>, where thousands were added to the faith. This growth is a testament to the work of the Holy Spirit and the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, which speaks of salvation reaching the ends of the earth. The imagery of "bearing fruit" connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where abiding in Him results in fruitfulness.<p><b>just as it has been doing among you</b><br>Paul acknowledges the active work of the gospel in the Colossian church, affirming their faith and spiritual growth. This mirrors the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>, where the seed that falls on good soil yields a bountiful harvest. The Colossians' transformation is evidence of the gospel's power to change lives, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where believers become new creations in Christ.<p><b>since the day you heard it</b><br>The moment of hearing the gospel marks the beginning of faith, as faith comes from hearing the message of Christ (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). This highlights the importance of evangelism and the proclamation of the Word. The Colossians' initial reception of the gospel is a reminder of the importance of responding to God's call, as seen in the conversion of Lydia in <a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>.<p><b>and truly understood the grace of God.</b><br>Understanding God's grace is central to the Christian faith, emphasizing salvation as a gift, not earned by works (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The Colossians' comprehension of grace reflects a deep spiritual insight, aligning with Paul's teaching in <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-12</a> about grace instructing believers to live godly lives. This understanding is foundational to the believer's identity in Christ and the assurance of eternal life, as seen in <a href="/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16-17</a>, where grace and truth come through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to the Colossians, addressing the believers in Colossae.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/colossae.htm">Colossae</a></b><br>- An ancient city in Asia Minor where the recipients of this letter resided.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>- The good news of Jesus Christ, which is central to the message of the letter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_colossian_church.htm">The Colossian Church</a></b><br>- The community of believers in Colossae who received the gospel and were growing in faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>- Refers to the broader reach of the gospel beyond Colossae, indicating its universal impact.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_the_gospel.htm">The Universality of the Gospel</a></b><br>The gospel is not limited to a specific group or region; it is for all people everywhere.

The probable reading is, <span class= "ital">which is come unto you, just as in all the world it is now bringing forth fruit and growing, as also it does in you.</span> In this sentence there are two lessons implied. First, the universality of the gospel, in which it stands contrasted, as with all local and national religions, whether of Judaism or of Paganism, so also with the secret doctrines of Gnostic speculation, intelligible only to the initiated few. Next, the test of its reality both by practical fruit of action, and by the spiritual growth connected therewith. In relation to the former, "faith without works" is "dead"; in relation to the other it is "imperfect," needing to be developed into maturity (<a href="/james/2-20.htm" title="But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?">James 2:20</a>; <a href="/james/2-22.htm" title="See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?">James 2:22</a>). Both these lessons were evidently needed, in consequence of the appearance at Colossae of the occult mysticism and the unpractical speculation noted in <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. But the Church itself was still faithful. Hence the last words, "as also it does in you," turning back again to Colossae in particular, are an insertion of kindly courtesy--one of the insertions of apparent afterthought not unfrequent in St. Paul's Epistles--intended to show that the implied warning is by no means a condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/colossians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That is come unto you, even as also</span> (it is) <span class="cmt_word">in all the world, bearing fruit and increasing, as in you also</span> (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>; Acts if. 47; 5:14; 6:7; 9:31; 11:21; 12:24; 19:20). The words, "and increasing," are added to the text on the testimony, all but unanimous, of the older witnesses. Their propriety is manifest; for the success of the gospel at Colossae was a gratifying evidence, both of its inherent fruitfulness, and of its rapid progress in the Gentile world. Stationary at Rome (see Introduction, &sect; 3), and with his messengers coming and going, and news reaching him from time to time of the advance of the Christian cause, the strong expression, "in all the world," is natural to St. Paul. From Rome "all the world" is surveyed, just as what takes place at Rome seems to resound "in all the world" (<a href="/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). <span class="accented">Bearing fruit</span> (verb in middle voice, implying inherent energy) precedes <span class="accented">growing - the</span> first "describing the inner working," the second" the outward extension of the gospel" (Lightfoot). For "bearing fruit," comp. <a href="/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a>; <a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8, 16</a>: and for "growing," <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-33</a>; and parallel passages; see also ver. 11. In the last clause the expression "doubles back upon itself" in a fashion characteristic of St. Paul, whose sentences grow and change their form like living things while he indites them (comp. <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, R.V.): the coming of the gospel to Colossae suggests the thought of its advent in the world, and this gives place to the fuller idea of its fruitfulness and expansion, which in turn is evidenced by its effect at Colossae. <span class="cmt_word">Since the day that ye heard (it), and knew well the grace of God in truth</span> (ver. 5; <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1, 2, 13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 11</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>). For their progress had been continuous (comp. <a href="/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>). Meyer and Ellicott, with the A.V., better maintain the connection of thought in understanding "the gospel" as object of "heard." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">knew well</span>, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 9, etc.), belongs specially to the vocabulary of this group of Epistles. <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>, in 1 Corinthians, is denoted by the simple <span class="accented">gnosis.</span> But this word became at an early time the watchword of the heretical <span class="accented">Gnostics</span> (" men of knowledge:" comp. <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>); and the false teachers of Colossae pretended to an intellectual superiority, asserted, we may imagine, in much the same way (comp. <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>). The apostle now prefers the more precise and distinctive <span class="accented">epignosis</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>), meaning" accurate" or" advanced knowledge" (see Lightfoot here, and on ver. 9). "To hear the gospel" is "to know well the grace of God" (<a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20 - 6:1</a>; <a href="/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>); the <span class="accented">full knowledge</span> of which "in truth" (ver. 5; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15, 20-24</a>) would preserve the Colossians from knowledge falsely so called. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/colossians/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(tou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
