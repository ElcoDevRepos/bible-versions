The context is crucial as it follows a series of miraculous events where Jesus demonstrated His divine power and authority. The disciples had witnessed Jesus feeding large crowds with minimal resources, yet they struggled to grasp the full significance of these miracles. This question from Jesus is a direct challenge to their understanding and faith. It reflects a teaching moment where Jesus is guiding His disciples to deeper spiritual insight.<p><b>&#8220;Do you still not understand?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the disciples' ongoing struggle to comprehend Jesus' identity and mission. Despite witnessing numerous miracles, they often failed to see beyond the physical acts to the spiritual truths they represented. The phrase "still not understand" suggests a repeated pattern of misunderstanding or lack of insight. This echoes earlier moments in the Gospel where Jesus rebukes the disciples for their lack of faith or understanding (e.g., <a href="/mark/4-40.htm">Mark 4:40</a>, <a href="/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>). It also foreshadows the continued development of the disciples' faith journey, which will culminate in a fuller understanding after the resurrection. The question serves as a call to deeper reflection and spiritual awareness, urging the disciples&#8212;and readers&#8212;to move beyond surface-level perceptions to grasp the profound truths of Jesus' teachings and actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples and challenging their understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being questioned about their comprehension of His teachings and miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_of_dalmanutha.htm">The Region of Dalmanutha</a></b><br>The location where Jesus and His disciples are during this part of the account, following the feeding of the four thousand.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_insight_over_physical_needs.htm">Spiritual Insight Over Physical Needs</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of understanding spiritual truths rather than focusing solely on physical needs.

They worry about having only one loaf, forgetting that He has twice multiplied bread (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41-44</a>; 8:6-9). By opening with &#8220;Then,&#8221; Scripture ties this question to those recent miracles. It is a gentle but firm reminder that:<p>&#8226;He has already shown Himself able to provide (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19-25</a>).<p>&#8226;Every sign was meant to strengthen faith, not just fill stomachs (<a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226;Spiritual dullness can follow even the clearest works of God (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you still</b><p>The word &#8220;still&#8221; highlights an ongoing pattern.

After feeding five thousand they &#8220;did not understand about the loaves&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>). Now, despite a second miraculous feeding, their concern remains earthly.
