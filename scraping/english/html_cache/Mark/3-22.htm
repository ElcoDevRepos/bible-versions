Their journey from Jerusalem, the religious center of Judaism, to Galilee indicates the seriousness with which they viewed Jesus' activities. This movement "down" from Jerusalem is geographically accurate, as Jerusalem is situated on a higher elevation. The presence of these scribes suggests an official delegation sent to investigate Jesus, reflecting the growing concern among Jewish leaders about His teachings and miracles.<p><b>were saying, &#8220;He is possessed by Beelzebul,&#8221;</b><br>The accusation that Jesus was possessed by Beelzebul, a name associated with a Philistine god and later used as a term for Satan or a chief demon, reflects the scribes' attempt to discredit Jesus' authority and power. This charge is a serious one, as it attributes Jesus' miraculous works to demonic influence rather than divine authority. The use of "Beelzebul" highlights the spiritual conflict between Jesus and the forces of evil, a recurring theme in the Gospels.<p><b>and, &#8220;By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.&#8221;</b><br>This statement further accuses Jesus of using demonic power to perform exorcisms, a claim that undermines His divine mission. The title "prince of the demons" refers to Satan, suggesting that Jesus' power over demons comes from an alliance with evil. This accusation is ironic, as Jesus' ability to cast out demons demonstrates His authority over them, affirming His divine nature. This charge also sets the stage for Jesus' response, where He logically refutes the idea that Satan would work against himself, emphasizing the absurdity of their claim.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders and scholars of the Jewish law who were often in opposition to Jesus.

They gave as their authoritative judgment, "He hath Beelzebub." One of the most prominent characteristics of the public works of our Lord was the expulsion of evil spirits. There was no questioning the facts. Even modern scepticism is here at fault, and is constrained to admit the fact of sudden and complete cures of insanity. So the scribes were obliged to account for what they could not deny. "He hath Beelzebub," they say; that is, he is possessed by Beelzebub, or "the lord of the dwelling," as a source of supernatural power. They had heard it alleged against him," He hath a devil;" and so they fall in with this popular error, and give it emphasis, by saying, Not only has he a devil, but he is possessed by the chief of the devils, and therefore has authority over inferior spirits. Observe the contrast between the thoughts of the multitude and of those who professed to be their teachers, the scribes and Pharisees. The multitude, free from prejudice, and using only their natural light of reason, candidly owned the greatness of Christ's miracles as wrought by a Divine power; whereas the Pharisees, filled with envy and malice, attributed these mighty works which he wrought by the finger of God, to the direct agency of Satan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
