This indicates the immediacy and urgency of the situation. The interruption highlights the pressing nature of Jairus's need and the unfolding of divine timing. It also emphasizes Jesus' accessibility and willingness to be interrupted for the sake of compassion and ministry.<p><b>messengers from the house of Jairus arrived</b><br>Jairus is identified as a synagogue leader, a position of significant religious and social standing in Jewish society. The arrival of messengers suggests the importance of the message and the urgency of the situation. In the cultural context, messengers were often used to convey important news quickly, reflecting the gravity of the situation at Jairus's home.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Your daughter is dead;</b><br>This statement is a declaration of finality and despair. In Jewish culture, death was considered a significant and often irreversible event, marked by mourning and ritual. The news would have been devastating to Jairus, highlighting the human experience of loss and the seeming end of hope. This sets the stage for Jesus to demonstrate His power over death, a foreshadowing of His own resurrection.<p><b>why bother the Teacher anymore?&#8221;</b><br>The term "Teacher" acknowledges Jesus' role as a rabbi and spiritual leader. The question reflects a common human tendency to lose hope in the face of death, viewing it as the ultimate end. It also reveals a limited understanding of Jesus' power and authority.

Go in peace and be free of your affliction&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The timing is deliberate. Before Jairus can even respond, a crisis interrupts. Scripture often shows the Lord working while human circumstances keep moving (cf. <a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>; <a href="/john/4-49.htm">John 4:49-51</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith is being stretched.

From human perspective death ends the possibility of help (cf. <a href="/john/11-14.htm">John 11:14, 32</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, death is the great divider (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Only divine power can reverse it (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Jairus&#8217;s deepest fear is realized, yet the narrative will reveal that Christ&#8217;s authority extends even here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why bother the Teacher anymore?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The messengers assume Jesus&#8217; power is limited to healing, not resurrection.

He teaches that faith does not hinge on visible possibilities (cf. <a href="/mark/10-27.htm">Mark 10:27</a>; <a href="/luke/8-50.htm">Luke 8:50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-35.htm">Mark 5:35</a> records the moment when earthly facts collide with heavenly power. A father&#8217;s hope is crushed by news of death, and well-meaning friends counsel resignation. Yet Jesus stands present, undeterred, ready to prove that for Him even the finality of the grave is temporary. The verse invites believers to trust Christ&#8217;s word over circumstance, remembering that His authority extends beyond every human boundary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Why troublest thou.</span>--The primary meaning of the verb is "to strip or flay."
