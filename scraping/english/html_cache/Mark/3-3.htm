This encounter takes place in a synagogue, a central place for Jewish worship and community life. The presence of the man in the synagogue suggests he was seeking spiritual solace or healing. Jesus' attention to him highlights His compassion and willingness to address human suffering. This act also sets the stage for a confrontation with the Pharisees, who were watching to see if Jesus would heal on the Sabbath, thus challenging their legalistic interpretations of the law.<p><b>&#8220;Stand up among us.&#8221;</b><br>By instructing the man to stand up, Jesus is making a public demonstration of His power and authority. This command serves multiple purposes: it draws attention to the man, ensuring that all present will witness the miracle, and it challenges the prevailing religious authorities by performing a healing on the Sabbath. The act of standing up is symbolic of faith and obedience, as the man responds to Jesus' command despite the potential for social and religious backlash. This moment foreshadows the greater spiritual healing and restoration that Jesus offers to all who believe in Him. It also echoes the call to stand firm in faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to stand firm against spiritual challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_withered_hand.htm">The Man with the Withered Hand</a></b><br>An individual suffering from a physical ailment, representing those in need of healing and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_synagogue.htm">The Synagogue</a></b><br>A place of Jewish worship and teaching, where Jesus often taught and performed miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group known for strict adherence to the Law, often in conflict with Jesus over interpretations of the Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbath.htm">The Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, central to the conflict in this passage as Jesus heals on the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_authority_and_compassion.htm">Jesus' Authority and Compassion</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His authority over religious traditions by prioritizing compassion and healing over strict legalism.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_stand.htm">The Call to Stand</a></b><br>Jesus' command to "Stand up among us" is a call to faith and action, inviting individuals to step forward and receive His healing and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_the_sabbath.htm">The Purpose of the Sabbath</a></b><br>The Sabbath is meant for restoration and worship, not as a burden.

In <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a> Jesus declares, &#8220;The Son can do nothing by Himself unless He sees the Father doing it.&#8221; Every word here flows from perfect unity with the Father.<p>&#8226; The pattern of Christ&#8217;s decisive words in other healings reinforces the point: &#8220;I am willing...be clean&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>) and &#8220;Little girl, I say to you, get up!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>). Scripture presents His speech as both command and creative power&#8212;what He says happens.<p>&#8226; By addressing the man publicly, Jesus moves the debate over Sabbath law from theory to living testimony, echoing His earlier question, &#8220;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the man with the withered hand</b><p>&#8226; The phrase spotlights a specific sufferer, not an anonymous crowd. Jesus notices individuals, just as He &#8220;saw&#8221; Zacchaeus in the tree (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) and &#8220;looked at him and loved him&#8221; when the rich young ruler approached (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21</a>).<p>&#8226; A withered hand meant lost livelihood and social stigma, yet the Lord singles him out in compassion, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>, &#8220;A bruised reed He will not break.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The man contributes nothing but need&#8212;mirroring <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. Grace initiates; faith responds.<p>&#8226; By focusing on a hand&#8212;the instrument of work&#8212;Jesus confronts the very issue the Pharisees twist: what constitutes &#8220;work&#8221; on the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>).

Obedience precedes healing, just as Naaman had to dip in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>) and the ten lepers had to go show themselves to the priests (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Among us&#8221; places the man center stage in the synagogue, exposing hard hearts (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>) while giving the crowd an unmistakable view of God&#8217;s mercy.<p>&#8226; Public elevation foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s openness: &#8220;Everyone who acknowledges Me before men, I will also acknowledge before My Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus is also inviting the man into community, reversing isolation created by disability. Similar restoration appears when He tells the paralytic, &#8220;Take up your mat and go home&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>). The healed belong with the worshipers, not on the fringes.<p>&#8226; The command implicitly challenges the leaders: Will they rejoice in a brother&#8217;s restoration or cling to legalism? Their silence (<a href="/mark/3-4.htm">Mark 3:4</a>) condemns them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/3-3.htm">Mark 3:3</a> shows Jesus taking sovereign initiative, fixing His compassionate gaze on a broken man, and calling him to stand in faith before all.

The two accounts are easily reconciled if we first suppose the scribes and Pharisees to ask this question of our Lord, and then our Lord to answer them by putting their own question to them in another form. <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill?</span> Our Lord's meaning appears to be this: "If any one, baying it in his power, omits to do an act of mercy on the sabbath day-for one grievously afflicted, as this man is, if he is able to cure him, as I Christ am able, he does him a wrong; for he denies him that help which he owes him by the law of charity." Our Lord thus plainly signifies that not to do an act of kindness to a sick man on the sabbath day when you are able to do it, is really to do him a wrong. But it is never lawful to do a wrong; and therefore it is always lawful to do good, not excepting even the sabbath day, for that is dedicated to God and to good works. Whence it is a greater sin to do a wrong on the sabbath than on other days; for thus the sanctity of the sabbath is violated, just as it is all the more honoured and sanctified by doing good. In our Lord's judgment, then, to neglect to save, when you have it in your power to do so, is to destroy. <span class="cmt_word">They held their peace</span>. They could not answer him. They are obstinate indeed in their infidelity, who, when they can say nothing against the truth, refuse to say anything for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
