In the context of <a href="/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>, Jesus had sent two of His disciples to fetch a colt for His entry into Jerusalem, a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. The disciples' compliance underscores the importance of following divine guidance, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. Their obedience also reflects the trust and faith they had in Jesus, knowing that His instructions were purposeful and aligned with God's plan.<p><b>and the people gave them permission</b><br>This part of the verse demonstrates the divine orchestration of events. The people&#8217;s willingness to allow the disciples to take the colt suggests a recognition of Jesus' authority or possibly a divine influence on their hearts. In the cultural context of the time, animals were valuable property, and such a request would not typically be granted without question. This incident also parallels the concept of God preparing the way for His purposes, as seen in other biblical narratives where God moves the hearts of people to fulfill His plans, such as in <a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a> when the Israelites found favor in the eyes of the Egyptians.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Messiah, and Son of God, who instructs His disciples with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are tasked with carrying out His instructions, demonstrating obedience and trust.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and prophecy fulfillment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/colt.htm">Colt</a></b><br>The young donkey that Jesus instructs His disciples to fetch, symbolizing peace and fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/people.htm">People</a></b><br>Those who own or are near the colt, who allow the disciples to take it upon hearing Jesus' instructions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_instructions.htm">Obedience to Christ's Instructions</a></b><br>The disciples' actions demonstrate the importance of following Jesus' commands, even when the reasons are not immediately clear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_provision.htm">Trust in Divine Provision</a></b><br>The willingness of the people to let the disciples take the colt shows how God provides what is needed to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a colt is a direct fulfillment of prophecy, reinforcing the reliability of Scripture and God's sovereign plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Jesus' choice of a donkey over a horse symbolizes His peaceful and humble approach to kingship, contrasting with worldly expectations of power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The disciples' faith is demonstrated through their actions, reminding believers that faith often requires stepping out in obedience.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_11_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 11:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_6_Obedience_to_Jesus_will.htm">How does Mark 11:6 demonstrate obedience to Jesus' instructions in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faith_from_Mark_11_6.htm">What can we learn about faith from the disciples' actions in Mark 11:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_6_and_OT_Messiah_prophecies.htm">How does Mark 11:6 connect to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_trust_Jesus_today.htm">In what ways can we apply the disciples' trust in Jesus today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_6_Guidance_in_uncertainty.htm">How does Mark 11:6 encourage us to act when facing uncertain situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_6_Jesus_authority_mission.htm">What does Mark 11:6 reveal about Jesus' authority and divine mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_11_6_Faith_and_obedience_power.htm">How does Mark 11:6 demonstrate the power of faith and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_they_obey_in_Mark_11_6.htm">Why did the people comply without question in Mark 11:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/disciples'_reaction_to_jesus_walking_on_water.htm">How did the disciples react when Jesus walked on water?
