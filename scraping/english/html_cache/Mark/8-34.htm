The inclusion of both the crowd and the disciples suggests that the message is fundamental to all who would consider following Jesus. This setting underscores the public nature of Jesus' call to discipleship, emphasizing that it is open to everyone, not just a select few. The act of calling them to Him signifies the importance of the message He is about to deliver.<p><b>and He told them</b><br>Jesus' direct communication highlights the authority with which He speaks. In the Gospels, Jesus often uses direct speech to convey essential teachings, ensuring clarity and emphasis. This method of teaching is consistent with rabbinic traditions of the time, where a teacher would gather students to impart wisdom and instruction.<p><b>&#8220;If anyone wants to come after Me</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of voluntary discipleship. The use of "if" implies a choice, indicating that following Jesus is not compulsory but a decision that requires personal commitment. "Come after Me" suggests a journey or path, aligning with the idea of discipleship as a way of life rather than a one-time decision. This invitation is inclusive, extending to "anyone," which reflects the universal call of the Gospel.<p><b>he must deny himself</b><br>Denying oneself involves a radical reorientation of priorities and values. In the cultural context of the time, this would have been a countercultural message, as self-denial was not a common virtue in Greco-Roman society. This call to self-denial is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>, where believers are encouraged to consider others above themselves. It signifies a rejection of self-centeredness and an embrace of God's will.<p><b>and take up his cross</b><br>The cross, a Roman instrument of execution, symbolizes suffering, shame, and death. For Jesus' audience, this imagery would have been stark and shocking. Taking up one's cross implies a willingness to endure hardship and persecution for the sake of Christ. This phrase foreshadows Jesus' own crucifixion and serves as a call to identify with His suffering. It also connects to the idea of sacrificial living found in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices.<p><b>and follow Me</b><br>Following Jesus involves a continuous, active pursuit of His teachings and example. This phrase encapsulates the essence of discipleship, which is not merely about belief but about action and lifestyle. The call to follow is a call to imitate Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>, where believers are encouraged to follow in His steps. This ongoing process requires perseverance and commitment, reflecting the transformative journey of becoming more like Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the cost of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the general public who were following Jesus, curious about His teachings and miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The close followers of Jesus who are being directly instructed on the nature of true discipleship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>A symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and ultimately, redemption.

St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>) adds the words (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), "daily:" "let him take up his cross daily;" thus showing that "every day," and often "at every hour," something occurs which it becomes us to bear patiently and bravely, and so on continually through our whole life. He takes up his cross who is crucified to the world. But he to whom the world is crucified follows his crucified Lord. This cross assumes various forms; such as persecution and martyrdom, affliction and sorrow of whatever kind, appointed by God; temptations of Satan, permitted by God for our trial, to increase our humility and virtue, and to make brighter our crown. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
