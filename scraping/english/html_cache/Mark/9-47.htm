In the cultural context of the time, the eye was often seen as a window to the soul, and thus, a source of temptation. The radical action of "plucking it out" underscores the need for decisive action against sin. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of personal holiness and the call to remove anything that leads to sin, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>.<p><b>It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye</b><br>The "kingdom of God" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing both a present spiritual reality and a future hope. Entering the kingdom with "one eye" symbolizes the sacrifices and self-denial required to follow Christ. This reflects the biblical principle that spiritual well-being and eternal life are of greater value than physical wholeness or temporary pleasures.<p><b>than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Gehenna," which refers to the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside Jerusalem associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By the time of Jesus, it had become a symbol of final judgment and eternal separation from God. This phrase serves as a stark warning about the consequences of unrepentant sin and the reality of divine judgment, echoing themes found in <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a> and <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41-46</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the seriousness of sin and the radical measures needed to avoid it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all followers of Christ who are called to live a life of holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_god.htm">Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The ultimate destination for believers, representing eternal life and communion with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hell.htm">Hell (Gehenna)</a></b><br>A place of eternal punishment, used here to emphasize the severity of sin and the consequences of not dealing with it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eye.htm">Eye</a></b><br>Symbolically represents what we see and desire, highlighting the importance of guarding our senses against sinful influences.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Jesus uses hyperbolic language to stress the importance of dealing with sin decisively.
