This awareness is consistent with His ability to perceive the hearts and minds of people, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. It underscores His role as the all-knowing Son of God.<p><b>Jesus asked them</b><br>Jesus often used questions as a teaching method, prompting His disciples to reflect on their understanding and faith. This Socratic method encourages deeper contemplation and self-examination, a common rabbinic technique of the time.<p><b>Why are you debating about having no bread?</b><br>The disciples' concern about physical bread reveals their misunderstanding of Jesus' recent miracles, such as the feeding of the 4,000 (<a href="/mark/8.htm">Mark 8:1-9</a>). This question highlights their focus on material needs rather than spiritual truths. It also reflects a common human tendency to worry about immediate physical needs, as addressed in <a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-34</a>.<p><b>Do you still not see or understand?</b><br>This question points to the disciples' spiritual blindness and lack of comprehension despite witnessing Jesus' miracles. It echoes the prophetic words of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> about people who see but do not perceive. The disciples' struggle to grasp Jesus' identity and mission is a recurring theme in the Gospels.<p><b>Do you have such hard hearts?</b><br>A hard heart in biblical terms refers to spiritual insensitivity and resistance to God's truth. This phrase connects to the Old Testament, where Pharaoh's heart was hardened (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>). It serves as a warning against unbelief and a call to openness to divine revelation.

It is as though he said, "Why reason ye because ye have no bread, as though I was referring to natural things, and speaking concerning bread for the body, and wishing you to be anxious about that; as though I could not provide that for you, if nccessary, just as easily here on the sea as I did just now in the desert?" Dr. John Lightfoot ('Hebrew Excrcitations on St. Matthew,' vol. 2:p. 201) says, "The rule of the Jews was very strict as to the kind of leaven that was to be used; and the disciples supposed that our Lord was alluding to this when he cautioned them to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees." Perhaps they also thought that our Lord was conveying a silent reproof to them for not having brought a sufficient supply of bread with them. The whole incident, while it shows their transparent simplicity of character, exhibits also their dulness of apprehension. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Aware of [their conversation],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gnous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] asked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(legei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">them,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
