Angels frequently appear in Scripture to deliver messages from God, often beginning with reassurance, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>. The command not to be alarmed addresses the natural fear and confusion the women felt upon encountering the supernatural.<p><b>You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene,</b><br>Referring to Jesus as "the Nazarene" highlights His earthly origins and fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, where the Messiah is called a "Branch" (Hebrew: "netzer"). Nazareth was a small, seemingly insignificant town, emphasizing the humble beginnings of Jesus, as noted in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>.<p><b>who was crucified.</b><br>The crucifixion is central to Christian theology, representing the atoning sacrifice for sin. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describe the suffering servant. The mention of crucifixion underscores the historical reality of Jesus' death, a cornerstone of the Gospel message.<p><b>He has risen!</b><br>This declaration is the cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming the resurrection as the validation of Jesus' divine nature and the fulfillment of His predictions (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:34). The resurrection is seen as the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), guaranteeing believers' future resurrection.<p><b>He is not here!</b><br>The empty tomb is a powerful testament to the resurrection. It serves as evidence that Jesus physically rose from the dead, distinguishing Christianity from other religions. The absence of Jesus' body counters any claims that His followers stole it, as suggested in <a href="/matthew/28-13.htm">Matthew 28:13</a>.<p><b>See the place where they put Him.</b><br>The invitation to see the empty tomb provides tangible evidence of the resurrection. This aligns with the Jewish legal principle of establishing truth through witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).
