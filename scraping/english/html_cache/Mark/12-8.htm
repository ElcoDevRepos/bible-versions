The act of seizing the son symbolizes the rejection and hostility Jesus faced from the religious leaders of His time. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's messengers being rejected by those they are sent to. Historically, the religious leaders in Israel had a pattern of rejecting prophets sent by God, as seen in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8-9</a>). The seizing of the son foreshadows the arrest of Jesus by the chief priests and scribes, as recorded later in the Gospel of Mark (<a href="/mark/14-43.htm">Mark 14:43-46</a>).<p><b>killed him</b><br>The killing of the son in the parable is a direct prophecy of Jesus' crucifixion. This act represents the ultimate rejection of God's authority and love, as embodied in His Son. Theologically, it underscores the gravity of sin and the extent of human rebellion against God. The death of the son parallels the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where a spotless lamb was killed to atone for sin, pointing to Jesus as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This event fulfills numerous prophecies about the suffering Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being "pierced for our transgressions."<p><b>and threw him out of the vineyard</b><br>The act of throwing the son out of the vineyard signifies the complete rejection and dishonor shown to him. In the cultural context of the time, not only killing someone but also denying them a proper burial was a profound act of disgrace. This mirrors the treatment of Jesus, who was crucified outside the city walls of Jerusalem (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), symbolizing His rejection by the people He came to save. The vineyard represents Israel, and the rejection of the son signifies Israel's rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. This action also serves as a warning of the coming judgment upon those who reject God's Son, as seen in the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals who were entrusted with the care of the vineyard.

The parable therefore foreshadows literal events that unfolded during Passion Week.<p>&#8226; This seizure wasn&#8217;t an accident; it fulfilled God&#8217;s predetermined plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>) yet fully exposed human responsibility for rejecting God&#8217;s ultimate revelation in His Son (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>killed him</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;killed him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-8.htm">Mark 12:8</a>) points to the cross.

His willing submission fulfills <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> while exposing the depth of human sin.<p>&#8226; Unlike the servants, the son&#8217;s death brings decisive consequences. In the parable&#8217;s next verse, the owner comes in judgment (<a href="/mark/12-9.htm">Mark 12:9</a>), anticipating the AD 70 destruction of Jerusalem and the ultimate accountability of all who reject Christ (<a href="/matthew/21-43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and threw him out of the vineyard</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Threw him out of the vineyard&#8221; (<a href="/mark/12-8.htm">Mark 12:8</a>) highlights public disgrace added to death. The vineyard symbolizes Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1&#8211;7</a>); expelling the son shows complete dismissal of God&#8217;s rightful heir.<p>&#8226; Literally, Jesus was crucified &#8220;outside the city gate&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>) at Golgotha (<a href="/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>). This fulfilled the pattern of the sin offering burned &#8220;outside the camp&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>) and the scapegoat bearing sin to the wilderness (<a href="/leviticus/16-10.htm">Leviticus 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Being cast out underscores separation: sinners cast the Savior away so they could keep control. Yet in God&#8217;s design, the rejected One becomes the cornerstone (<a href="/mark/12-10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>), gathering a new people composed of all who believe (<a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The act also signals that true worship would move beyond the confines of the old vineyard; salvation would reach &#8220;the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-8.htm">Mark 12:8</a> captures the climactic rebellion of the leaders against God&#8217;s Son: they seize Him, kill Him, and discard Him in disgrace.
