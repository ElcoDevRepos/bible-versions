The Syrophoenician origin points to a specific geographical area, the region of Phoenicia, which is part of modern-day Lebanon. This area was known for its pagan practices and idol worship, which contrasts with the Jewish monotheistic faith. The mention of her origin highlights the cultural and religious barriers that existed between Jews and Gentiles at the time. This encounter foreshadows the later expansion of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Peter and Cornelius.<p><b>and she kept asking Jesus</b><br>The persistence of the woman is significant. It demonstrates her faith and desperation, as she continually seeks Jesus' help despite the initial lack of response. This persistence is reminiscent of the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, which teaches about the importance of persistent prayer. Her actions also reflect a deep belief in Jesus' power to heal, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels where faith is often a prerequisite for miracles (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<p><b>to drive the demon out of her daughter</b><br>Demon possession was a recognized affliction in the New Testament, often associated with physical and mental suffering. The request to drive out the demon indicates the woman's belief in Jesus' authority over evil spirits, a theme that is consistent throughout the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>, <a href="/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a>). This act of exorcism by Jesus not only demonstrates His power over the spiritual realm but also serves as a type of His ultimate victory over Satan and evil, which is fulfilled through His death and resurrection. The deliverance of the woman's daughter can be seen as a precursor to the broader deliverance that Jesus offers to all humanity from sin and evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_syrophoenician_woman.htm">The Syrophoenician Woman</a></b><br>A Gentile woman from the region of Phoenicia in Syria.
