In the context of <a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5</a>, Jesus had just performed a significant miracle by casting out a legion of demons from a man, sending them into a herd of pigs. The people&#8217;s response of begging Jesus to leave is surprising given the miraculous deliverance they witnessed. This reaction can be understood in light of the fear and awe that often accompanied Jesus' miracles, as seen in other parts of the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>, where Peter reacts with fear after a miraculous catch of fish). The people&#8217;s request may also reflect a fear of further economic loss, as the destruction of the pigs represented a significant financial impact.<p><b>to leave their region.</b><br>The region referred to here is the area of the Gerasenes, located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. This area was predominantly Gentile, which is significant in understanding the cultural and religious dynamics at play. The presence of a large herd of pigs, animals considered unclean by Jewish law, underscores the Gentile nature of the region. The request for Jesus to leave may also reflect a cultural and religious discomfort with His Jewish identity and the power He displayed. This incident foreshadows the broader rejection Jesus would face, culminating in His crucifixion, and highlights the theme of Jesus being a stumbling block to those who do not understand His mission (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). Additionally, this rejection contrasts with the acceptance Jesus often found among Gentiles elsewhere, such as the Roman centurion in <a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gerasenes.htm">The Gerasenes</a></b><br>The region where the event takes place, inhabited by Gentiles, which is significant in understanding the cultural and religious context.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demoniac.htm">The Demoniac</a></b><br>A man possessed by a legion of demons, whom Jesus heals, demonstrating His authority over evil spirits.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_herdsmen.htm">The Herdsmen</a></b><br>Witnesses to the miracle, who report the event to the townspeople.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_townspeople.htm">The Townspeople</a></b><br>They react with fear and ask Jesus to leave, showing a preference for their economic stability over spiritual transformation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_change.htm">Fear of Change</a></b><br>The townspeople's reaction highlights a common human fear of change, even when it is for the better.
