In this context, they are responding to Jesus' question, highlighting their role as both followers and participants in His ministry. Their response reflects a common human perspective, often contrasting with Jesus' divine insight. The disciples' frequent misunderstandings serve to emphasize Jesus' patience and the gradual revelation of His identity and mission.<p><b>&#8220;You can see the crowd pressing in on You</b><br>The crowd pressing in on Jesus illustrates the immense popularity and demand for His presence and miracles. This scene is set in a bustling environment, typical of the regions around the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus conducted much of His ministry. The pressing crowd signifies the desperation and hope of the people seeking healing and teaching. It also foreshadows the challenges Jesus would face due to His growing fame, as seen in other parts of the Gospels.<p><b>and yet You ask,</b><br>This phrase underscores the disciples' confusion and limited understanding of Jesus' awareness and purpose. It highlights the contrast between human perception and divine knowledge. The disciples' question reflects a natural skepticism and a focus on the physical reality, missing the deeper spiritual significance of Jesus' inquiry.<p><b>&#8216;Who touched Me?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' question is not due to ignorance but serves a greater purpose. It draws attention to the faith of the woman who touched His garment, seeking healing. This moment emphasizes the personal nature of faith and the power of Jesus to heal not just physically but spiritually. It also demonstrates Jesus' ability to discern individual needs amidst the chaos, pointing to His divine nature. This incident connects to other scriptural themes of faith and healing, such as the healing of the centurion's servant (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>) and the woman with the issue of blood (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>), showcasing Jesus' authority over illness and His responsiveness to genuine faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>- Represents the multitude of people who followed Jesus, often seeking healing or to hear His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>- Although not directly mentioned in this verse, she is the one who touched Jesus, seeking healing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>- While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, much of Jesus' ministry, including this event, took place around this area.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The woman's faith led her to reach out to Jesus despite the crowd.

Their words sound almost like a gentle rebuke: &#8220;Jesus, everyone is touching You!&#8221;<p>&#8226; The remark highlights how naturally we default to sight, sound, and logic instead of spiritual discernment (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God&#8217;s people startled when the Lord pauses for reasons they cannot yet grasp (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/john/4-27.htm">John 4:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You can see the crowd pressing in on You</b><p>The disciples point to the obvious: a throng so dense that physical contact is unavoidable (<a href="/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/luke/8-42.htm">Luke 8:42</a>b).<p>&#8226; From a human standpoint, distinguishing one touch among many seems impossible.<p>&#8226; Yet the very mention of the crowd underscores Jesus&#8217; willingness to move toward needy people instead of avoiding them (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; What feels chaotic to the disciples is completely under His control, just as when He &#8220;touched&#8221; the leper no one else would approach (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and yet You ask</b><p>They cannot reconcile omniscience with the question. Shouldn&#8217;t Jesus already know? (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord often asks questions&#8212;not for His benefit, but to draw faith into the open (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>; <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Here He slows the moment so the healed woman can step forward, receive public affirmation, and hear Him call her &#8220;daughter&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>).<p>&#8226; The pause also becomes a living parable for the crowd: salvation is personal, not lost in a sea of humanity (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Who touched Me?&#8217;</b><p>Jesus distinguishes between accidental jostling and deliberate faith. Power has gone out of Him (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a>), evidence that a real miracle just occurred.<p>&#8226; Unlike the impersonal crowd bumping into Him, one desperate woman reached out believing He could make her whole (<a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/luke/8-45.htm">Luke 8:45&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; The question spotlights the contrast between proximity and personal connection. Many brushed against Jesus, but only one encountered Him savingly&#8212;echoing later crowds who heard Him gladly yet still cried, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-13.htm">Mark 15:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that Jesus knows every sincere reach of faith, however hidden, and refuses to let it remain anonymous (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-31.htm">Mark 5:31</a> reveals more than a puzzled remark. It exposes the disciples&#8217; limited perspective, magnifies Jesus&#8217; sovereign awareness in a chaotic scene, and elevates personal faith above mere physical nearness. The Lord&#8217;s question draws the healed woman&#8212;and every reader&#8212;into a deeper realization: amid the press of the crowd, He still sees, knows, and responds to the individual who trusts Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - St. Luke (<a href="/luke/8-45.htm">Luke 8:45</a>) adds here, "When all denied, Peter said, and they that were with him, Master, the multitudes press thee and crush <span class="accented">thee.</span> But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me." This incident shows the mysterious connection between the spiritual and the physical. The miraculous virtue or power which went forth from the Saviour was spiritual in its source and in the conditions on which it was imparted, but it was physical in its operation; and that which brought the two together was faith. Multitudes thronged the Saviour, but only one of the crowd <span class="accented">touched</span> him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
