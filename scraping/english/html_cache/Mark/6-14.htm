Herod Antipas ruled during the time of Jesus' ministry and was known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist. The "this" refers to the works and miracles of Jesus, which had become widely known. Herod's hearing of Jesus' activities indicates the extent of Jesus' influence and the spread of His reputation throughout the region.<p><b>for Jesus&#8217; name had become well known</b><br>The fame of Jesus had spread due to His teachings, miracles, and the growing number of followers. This widespread recognition is significant in the context of first-century Judea, where news traveled primarily by word of mouth. Jesus' name becoming well known fulfills the prophetic anticipation of a Messiah who would draw attention and provoke both awe and controversy.<p><b>and people were saying, &#8220;John the Baptist has risen from the dead!</b><br>The belief that John the Baptist had risen from the dead reflects the people's understanding of resurrection and their recognition of John's prophetic role. John was a significant religious figure, and his execution by Herod had left a profound impact. The idea of resurrection was not foreign to Jewish thought, as seen in the Pharisees' beliefs and Old Testament accounts like Elijah and Elisha's miracles.<p><b>That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.&#8221;</b><br>The attribution of miraculous powers to a resurrected John the Baptist indicates the people's attempt to rationalize Jesus' extraordinary abilities. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' identity and the source of His power are frequently misunderstood or misattributed.

Herod Antipas had married the daughter of Arctas, King of Arabia, but deserted her for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. <span class="cmt_word">John the Baptist is risen from the dead</span>; that is, "is risen in the person of Jesus Christ." St. Luke. (<a href="/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>) says that at first Herod was "much perplexed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)" "about him. At length, however, as he heard more and more of the fame of Christ's miracles, he came to the conclusion that our Lord was none other than John the Baptist risen again. Such is the opinion of St. Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and others. At that time the views of Pythagoras respecting the transmigration of souls were generally current, and probably influenced the troubled mind of Herod. He had put to death an innocent and holy man; and it is a high testimony to the worth of the Baptist that, under the reproaches of a guilty conscience, Herod should have come to the conclusion that he had risen from the dead, thus probably giving the lie to his own opinions as a Sadducee; and terrified lest the Baptist should now avenge his own murder. "What a great thing," exclaims St. Chrysostom," is virtue! for Herod fears him, even though dead." It should not be forgotten that this is the same Herod who set Jesus at nought and mocked him, when Pilate sent him to him, in the hope of relieving himself of the terrible responsibility of condemning one whom he knew to be innocent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="grk">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(basileus)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king, ruler, but in some passages clearly to be translated: emperor.
