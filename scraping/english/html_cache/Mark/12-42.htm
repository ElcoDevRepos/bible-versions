The mention of a widow highlights her marginalized status, emphasizing her faith and devotion despite her poverty. Widows are frequently mentioned in the Bible as deserving of special care (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Her action contrasts with the religious leaders who exploit widows (<a href="/mark/12-40.htm">Mark 12:40</a>).<p><b>and put in two small copper coins</b><br>The two small copper coins, known as "lepta," were the smallest denomination of currency in circulation at the time. This act of giving all she had is a profound demonstration of faith and trust in God&#8217;s provision. The widow's offering is a stark contrast to the larger sums given by the wealthy, highlighting the value of sacrificial giving over the amount given. This act is reminiscent of the widow of Zarephath in <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>, who gave her last meal to Elijah.<p><b>which amounted to a small fraction of a denarius</b><br>A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer, making the widow's offering a minuscule amount in economic terms. This phrase underscores the widow's poverty and the sacrificial nature of her gift. The denarius is often used in the New Testament to illustrate the value of money and labor (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). Her offering, though small, is significant in the eyes of God, illustrating the principle that God values the heart and intent behind the gift more than the monetary value.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who observes and teaches about the widow's offering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_widow.htm">The Poor Widow</a></b><br>A woman of humble means who gives all she has to the temple treasury, demonstrating profound faith and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_treasury.htm">The Temple Treasury</a></b><br>The place within the temple where offerings were collected, serving as the setting for this teaching moment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present and receive His teaching about the widow's offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_people.htm">The Rich People</a></b><br>Those who also contribute to the treasury, but from their abundance, contrasting with the widow's sacrificial giving.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_giving.htm">Sacrificial Giving</a></b><br>The widow's offering teaches us that true generosity is measured not by the amount given, but by the heart and sacrifice behind it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_trust_in_god.htm">Faith and Trust in God</a></b><br>Her willingness to give all she had demonstrates a profound trust in God's provision, challenging us to rely on Him fully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_perspective_on_wealth.htm">God's Perspective on Wealth</a></b><br>This passage reminds us that God values the heart's intention over material wealth, encouraging us to prioritize spiritual richness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_humility.htm">The Value of Humility</a></b><br>The widow's humble act is exalted by Jesus, teaching us that humility and sincerity in our actions are precious in God's sight.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_for_the_disadvantaged.htm">Encouragement for the Disadvantaged</a></b><br>The widow's account serves as a powerful reminder that everyone, regardless of their financial status, can contribute meaningfully to God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_12_42_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 12:42?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_12_42_Sacrificial_giving_today.htm">How does Mark 12:42 demonstrate sacrificial giving in our daily lives today?
