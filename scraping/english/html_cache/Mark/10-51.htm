It reflects the compassionate nature of Christ, who often asked questions to draw out faith and articulate desires (see also <a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30-34</a>). The question invites the blind man to express his faith and need directly, emphasizing the importance of personal faith in receiving healing. This interaction occurs in Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, known as the first city conquered by the Israelites in the Promised Land (Joshua 6). Jesus' question also mirrors the earlier interaction with James and John in <a href="/mark/10-36.htm">Mark 10:36</a>, where He asked them the same question, highlighting the contrast between their request for glory and the blind man's request for sight.<p><b>Jesus asked.</b><br>Jesus' direct engagement with the blind man demonstrates His accessibility and readiness to respond to those who call upon Him. This personal interaction is a hallmark of Jesus' ministry, where He often took time to address individuals amidst the crowds. It underscores the personal relationship He offers to believers, contrasting with the distant and impersonal nature of many religious leaders of the time. Jesus' approach fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>, which speaks of the Messiah opening the eyes of the blind, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>&#8220;Rabboni,&#8221; said the blind man,</b><br>The term "Rabboni" is an Aramaic word meaning "my teacher" or "my master," showing the blind man's respect and recognition of Jesus' authority. This title is used sparingly in the New Testament, notably by Mary Magdalene in <a href="/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>, indicating a deep personal reverence. The blind man's use of this term reflects his faith and acknowledgment of Jesus' power to heal. It also signifies a personal relationship with Jesus, as "Rabboni" conveys a sense of personal devotion and trust.<p><b>&#8220;let me see again.&#8221;</b><br>The blind man's request is straightforward and filled with faith, as he believes Jesus has the power to restore his sight. This plea for physical healing also symbolizes spiritual enlightenment, as blindness often represents spiritual ignorance or lack of understanding in biblical literature (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>). The request to "see again" suggests that the man may have had sight previously, indicating a desire to return to a state of wholeness. This healing act by Jesus not only fulfills messianic prophecies but also serves as a type of spiritual restoration available through Christ, who is the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.

His deliberate pause shows divine attentiveness (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal address contrasts with the disciples&#8217; earlier rebuke of Bartimaeus (<a href="/mark/10-48.htm">Mark 10:48</a>) and reminds us that the Savior never treats seekers as interruptions (<a href="/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s inquiry also puts responsibility on the listener: hearing the question, one must decide whether to respond in faith or remain silent (<a href="/hebrews/4-7.htm">Hebrews 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Rabboni,&#8221; said the blind man,</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Rabboni&#8221; expresses reverent submission&#8212;more intimate than &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; and used again by Mary Magdalene on resurrection morning (<a href="/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Though physically blind, Bartimaeus sees Jesus&#8217; true identity as Master, aligning with Peter&#8217;s earlier confession, &#8220;You are the Christ&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-29.htm">Mark 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; His address acknowledges that authority and power belong to Jesus alone (<a href="/psalms/146-8.htm">Psalm 146:8</a>; <a href="/luke/18-38.htm">Luke 18:38</a>), setting the stage for answered prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;let me see again.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The request is simple, direct, and faith-filled. He asks for restoration of sight, believing Christ is both willing and able (<a href="/mark/10-52.htm">Mark 10:52</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical healing in Scripture often mirrors spiritual illumination&#8212;&#8220;Then the eyes of the blind will be opened&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The man&#8217;s choice of words, &#8220;again,&#8221; hints at a lost condition regained, reminding believers that Jesus redeems what has been forfeited (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; His plea models how to pray: recognize Jesus&#8217; lordship, state the need plainly, and expect an answer consistent with God&#8217;s compassionate character (<a href="/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a> records a life-changing dialogue: Jesus invites a clear expression of need, listens with personal concern, receives a confession of His lordship, and responds to bold, specific faith. The verse teaches believers to approach Christ openly, trust His compassion, and ask expectantly, knowing He delights to restore both physical and spiritual sight.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(51) <span class= "bld">Lord.</span>--Better <span class= "ital">Rabboni,</span> the word being the same as in <a href="/john/20-16.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Mary.

The word was an augmentative form of Rabbi, and as such expressed greater reverence. It takes its place as another example of St. Mark's fondness for reproducing the very syllables that were spoken.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 51, 52.</span> - Our Lord well knew what he wanted; but it was necessary that he and those around him should hear from the lips of the blind man the confession of his need, and of his faith in the power that was present to heal him. <span class="cmt_word">And the blind man said</span> unto him, <span class="cmt_word">Rabboni, that I may receive my sight</span>. "Rabboni," or "Rabbuni," means literally, <span class="accented">my Master</span>. It was a more respectful mode of address than the more simple form "Rabbi." This expression shows that Bartimaeus had yet much to learn as to the Divine character of our Lord. But his faith is accepted; and he showed that it was genuine as far as it went, by forthwith following Jesus in the way. There were six occasions on which our Lord is recorded to have healed the blind: St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-27.htm">Matthew 9:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-14.htm">Matthew 21:14</a>); St. Mark (<a href="/mark/8-24.htm">Mark 8:24</a>; <a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>); St. John (<a href="/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>). St. Chrysostom says of Bartimaeus, that as before this gift of healing he showed perseverance, so after it he shewed gratitude. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
