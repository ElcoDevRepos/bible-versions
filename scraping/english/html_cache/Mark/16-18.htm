The act of handling snakes without harm is reminiscent of the Apostle Paul's experience in <a href="/acts/28-3.htm">Acts 28:3-5</a>, where he was bitten by a viper but suffered no ill effects. In the ancient Near East, snakes were often symbols of danger and evil, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The ability to handle snakes without harm signifies divine protection and authority over evil. This phrase should not be taken as a directive for testing faith but rather as an assurance of God's protection in the fulfillment of His mission.<p><b>and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them</b><br>This statement emphasizes divine protection over believers. In the historical context, poisoning was a known method of assassination, and the assurance here is that God will protect His followers from such dangers. This promise is not a call to test God by deliberately ingesting poison but rather an assurance of His safeguarding presence. Theologically, it reflects the broader biblical theme of God's protection over His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, where the faithful are promised safety from harm.<p><b>they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well.</b><br>The laying on of hands is a biblical practice associated with healing and the impartation of blessings or authority. In the New Testament, Jesus often healed the sick through touch, as seen in passages like <a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a> and <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>. The early church continued this practice, as seen in <a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17-18</a> with Ananias and Paul, and in <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a>, where the elders are instructed to pray over the sick. This phrase underscores the continuation of Jesus' healing ministry through His followers, empowered by the Holy Spirit. It highlights the compassionate nature of God and His desire for the wholeness of His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this promise, Jesus is addressing His disciples after His resurrection, commissioning them for the work ahead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' words, representing all believers who would follow in their footsteps.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/snakes_and_poison.htm">Snakes and Poison</a></b><br>Symbolic elements representing danger and harm, which believers are promised protection from.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sick.htm">The Sick</a></b><br>Individuals who are afflicted with illness, whom believers are empowered to heal through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_commission.htm">The Great Commission</a></b><br>The broader context of Jesus' instructions to His disciples to spread the Gospel and perform signs in His name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>Believers are assured of God's protection in their mission, symbolized by the handling of snakes and drinking poison without harm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_miracles.htm">Faith and Miracles</a></b><br>The passage encourages believers to have faith in God's power to perform miracles, such as healing the sick.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_snakes_and_poison.htm">Symbolism of Snakes and Poison</a></b><br>These elements represent spiritual and physical dangers that believers may encounter, but they are not to be feared.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_believers.htm">Role of Believers</a></b><br>Christians are called to be active participants in God's work, using the gifts and authority given to them to impact the world positively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>This verse is a reminder to trust in the promises of God, knowing that He equips and protects those who serve Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_16_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 16:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_believers_apply_pick_up_snakes.htm">How can believers today apply "they will pick up snakes" in their spiritual walk?

The sign is protective, not prescriptive; believers are not instructed to seek out snakes, but to trust God if danger arises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them</b><p>Just as with the snake promise, this speaks of divine safeguarding when hostile forces attempt to silence gospel witness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38-41</a> recounts Elisha neutralizing poisonous stew so the prophets remain unharmed, illustrating God&#8217;s power over toxins.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a> portrays wormwood-tainted waters killing many&#8212;reminding us poison is normally lethal, which magnifies the miracle when it is not.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a> depicts Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego emerging from the furnace unsinged; different threat, same protective principle.<p>In hostile territory, believers may face attempts on their lives. Christ assures that nothing can terminate their ministry until He says so (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>; <a href="/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will lay their hands on the sick, and they will be made well</b><p>The final sign shifts from personal protection to compassionate outreach.<p>&#8226; During His earthly ministry, Jesus often touched the sick (<a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>; 5:41), setting the model.<p>&#8226; The apostles continue this pattern: &#8220;They drove out many demons and anointed the sick with oil, and they were healed&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a> Peter lifts a lame man; <a href="/acts/9-17.htm">Acts 9:17-18</a> Ananias lays hands on Saul; <a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8-9</a> Paul heals Publius&#8217;s father, then many others.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a> instructs the church: elders pray and lay hands; &#8220;the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick.&#8221;<p>Healing validates the message and expresses the kingdom&#8217;s mercy, pointing forward to the day when sickness is gone forever (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> assures believers that, while advancing the gospel, God can grant visible signs of His kingdom&#8212;protection from otherwise fatal threats and power to heal the afflicted.
