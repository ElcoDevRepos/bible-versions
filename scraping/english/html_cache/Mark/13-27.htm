Angels are often depicted as messengers and servants of God throughout Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Their role in gathering the elect underscores their function in executing God's will. This action is part of the eschatological events described in the Olivet Discourse, where Jesus speaks of the end times.<p><b>to gather His elect</b><br>The term "elect" refers to those chosen by God, a concept rooted in the Old Testament with Israel as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, the elect are those who have faith in Christ, encompassing both Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). This gathering signifies the final redemption and salvation of believers, aligning with prophecies of a remnant being saved (<a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>).<p><b>from the four winds</b><br>The "four winds" symbolize the four cardinal directions, indicating universality and completeness. This imagery is used in prophetic literature to describe God's sovereign reach over the entire earth (<a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). It emphasizes that no part of the world is beyond God's reach and that His elect are scattered globally.<p><b>from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive scope of the gathering. "Ends of the earth" suggests the farthest geographical locations, while "ends of heaven" may imply the spiritual realm or the sky. This duality underscores the totality of God's gathering power, resonating with the promise of a new creation where heaven and earth are united (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). It reflects the fulfillment of God's covenant promises to gather His people from all nations (<a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is foretelling events related to His second coming and the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings who serve God and are sent by Jesus to gather the elect.
