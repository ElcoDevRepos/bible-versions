In biblical context, the sea often symbolizes chaos and disorder, and Jesus' ability to command it reflects His power to bring order. The act of rebuking the wind and sea parallels God's control over creation as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. This event occurs on the Sea of Galilee, known for sudden and violent storms due to its geographical location. Jesus' rebuke is reminiscent of God's rebuke of the sea in <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>, demonstrating His sovereignty.<p><b>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; He commanded. &#8220;Be still!&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' command is direct and authoritative, reflecting His power over the natural world. The words "Silence!" and "Be still!" are imperative, showing that creation responds to His voice. This echoes the authority of God's word in creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks and it comes to be. The command also foreshadows the peace Jesus brings to the spiritual chaos in human lives, as seen in His ministry of healing and deliverance. The calming of the storm can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over chaos and evil.<p><b>And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm.</b><br>The immediate response of the wind and sea to Jesus' command underscores His divine nature. The phrase "perfectly calm" indicates a complete and miraculous transformation, emphasizing the totality of Jesus' power. This calmness can be seen as a metaphor for the peace that Jesus offers to believers, as referenced in <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>, where the peace of God surpasses all understanding. The calming of the storm also serves as a sign to the disciples of Jesus' true identity, reinforcing their faith and understanding of Him as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were with Him in the boat, experiencing fear and awe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The body of water where this event took place, known for sudden and violent storms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wind_and_the_sea.htm">The Wind and the Sea</a></b><br>Natural elements that Jesus commands, showcasing His power over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>Jesus' command over the wind and sea illustrates His divine authority, reminding us of His sovereignty over all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>The disciples' fear contrasts with Jesus' calm, teaching us to trust in His power during life's storms.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peace_in_christ.htm">Peace in Christ</a></b><br>Just as Jesus brought peace to the stormy sea, He offers peace in our hearts amidst life's challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_of_creation.htm">Obedience of Creation</a></b><br>The immediate response of the wind and sea to Jesus' command highlights the obedience of creation to its Creator.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/presence_of_jesus.htm">Presence of Jesus</a></b><br>The presence of Jesus in the boat with the disciples assures us of His presence with us in our trials.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_4_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 4:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_4_39_Jesus_authority_today.htm">How does Mark 4:39 demonstrate Jesus' authority over nature in our lives today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_calming_the_storm.htm">What can we learn from Jesus' response to the storm in Mark 4:39?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_4_39_Genesis_1_1-3_God_s_power.htm">How does Mark 4:39 connect to God's sovereignty in Genesis 1:1-3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Peace_be_still_daily.htm">How can we apply Jesus' command "Peace, be still" in daily challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Mark_4_39_boost_faith_in_trials.htm">In what ways can Mark 4:39 strengthen our faith during life's storms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_4_39_show_Jesus_power.htm">How does Mark 4:39 demonstrate Jesus' authority over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_4_39_Jesus_divine_identity.htm">What does Mark 4:39 reveal about Jesus' divine identity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_4_39_boost_faith_in_trials.htm">How can Mark 4:39 strengthen faith during personal storms?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_jesus_calm_the_storm.htm">How does Jesus calm the storm in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_sea_of_galilee_story's_meaning.htm">What is the significance of the Sea of Galilee story?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_perform_miracles.htm">What was the purpose of Jesus' miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_you_help_me,_god.htm">Can you help me, God?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Mark 4:39 Mean</div><b>Then Jesus got up</b><p>&#8226;

The Greek perfect implies that before the word was uttered, the thing was done by the simple fiat of his will preceding the word. The combined descriptions of the synoptists show that the storm was very violent, such as no human power could have composed or stilled. So that these words indicate the supreme authority of Christ as God, ruling the sea with his mighty power. Thus Christ shows himself to be God. In like manner, Christ is able to overrule and control the persecutions of the Church and the temptations of the soul. St. Augustine says that "when we allow temptations to overcome us, Christ sleeps in us. We forget Christ at such times. Let us, then, remember him. Let us awake him. He will speak. He will rebuke the tempest in the soul, and there will be a great calm." <span class="cmt_word">There was a great calm</span>. For all creation perceives its Creator. He never speaks in vain. It is observable that, as in his miracles of healing, the subjects of them usually passed at once to perfect soundness, so here, there was no gradual subsiding of the storm, as in the ordinary operations of nature, but almost before the word had escaped his lips there was a perfect calm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] got up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#961;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(diegertheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1326.htm">Strong's 1326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wake out of sleep, arouse in general, stir up.
