For a beggar like Bartimaeus, it might have been one of his few possessions, possibly used to collect alms. The act of throwing it off signifies a decisive break from his past life and a readiness to embrace change. This action can be seen as a demonstration of faith, similar to the call of the disciples who left their nets to follow Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>). It symbolizes casting aside old ways and hindrances to follow Christ.<p><b>Bartimaeus jumped up</b><br>Bartimaeus's immediate response to Jesus' call is one of eagerness and urgency. His physical action of jumping up reflects his inner excitement and hope. This mirrors the enthusiasm seen in other biblical figures who respond to God's call with immediacy, such as Zacchaeus who hurried down from the tree to meet Jesus (<a href="/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>). It highlights the transformative power of Jesus' presence and the hope He brings to those who seek Him.<p><b>and came to Jesus</b><br>Bartimaeus's movement towards Jesus is significant, as it represents a step of faith and trust. Despite his blindness, he moves towards the source of his healing. This act of coming to Jesus is a central theme in the Gospels, where individuals are invited to approach Christ for healing, forgiveness, and salvation. It echoes the invitation Jesus extends in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, "Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." Bartimaeus's approach to Jesus is a physical manifestation of his faith and desire for transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bartimaeus.htm">Bartimaeus</a></b><br>A blind beggar sitting by the roadside in Jericho.

Laying it aside shows a literal, physical abandonment of security and identity&#8212;an act of faith that echoes <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, &#8220;let us throw off every encumbrance,&#8221; and <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>, &#8220;to put off your former way of life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His response contrasts sharply with the rich young ruler just verses earlier (<a href="/mark/10-21.htm">Mark 10:21-22</a>) who clung to possessions. Bartimaeus instantly surrenders what little he has.<p>&#8226; Like the disciples who &#8220;left everything and followed Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-28.htm">Luke 18:28</a>), Bartimaeus demonstrates that coming to Christ requires letting go, whether much or little.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bartimaeus jumped up</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Bartimaeus jumped up&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-50.htm">Mark 10:50</a>)<p>&#8226; The vigor of his leap shows eager faith. There is no delay or calculation&#8212;only immediate action, reminiscent of the fishermen who &#8220;immediately left their nets&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; His leap anticipates the wholeness Jesus will grant. <a href="/acts/3-8.htm">Acts 3:8</a> records another healed man who &#8220;leaped up and began to walk,&#8221; fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>, &#8220;then the lame will leap like a deer.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Saved people often display this same joyful urgency&#8212;Zacchaeus &#8220;hurried down and welcomed Him gladly&#8221; (<a href="/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>).

Bartimaeus closes the gap himself; no one carries him.<p>&#8226; The flow of <a href="/bsb/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a> sets this moment against earlier scenes: children were brought so they could &#8220;come&#8221; (vv. 13-16), the rich young man refused to &#8220;come&#8221; after being invited (v. 21), yet a blind beggar succeeds where the privileged failed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-50.htm">Mark 10:50</a> pictures a decisive break with the past, enthusiastic obedience, and a direct approach to the Savior. Bartimaeus&#8217; simple actions&#8212;casting aside his cloak, springing to his feet, and moving toward Jesus&#8212;model the outward evidence of inward faith. He lets nothing hinder him, proves his belief with immediate action, and finds life where he expects it: in Jesus alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he, casting away his garment, rose</span> - the word in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. literally, <span class="accented">sprang to his feet - <span class="cmt_word"></span>and came to Jesus</span>.
