The context is Jesus speaking to those in Nazareth, His hometown, after being rejected by them. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Gospels where Jesus often addresses disbelief and misunderstanding directly.<p><b>&#8220;Only in his hometown</b><br>Nazareth, where Jesus grew up, is the specific location referred to here. It was a small, insignificant village in Galilee, which is significant because it highlights the humility of Jesus' earthly origins. This phrase underscores the irony that those who knew Jesus best in His human life were the least likely to recognize His divine mission.<p><b>among his relatives</b><br>This highlights the familial context of Jesus' ministry. His relatives, who had known Him since childhood, struggled to accept His divine authority and mission. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where familiarity breeds contempt, and those closest to Jesus often failed to understand His true identity.<p><b>and in his own household</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intimate setting of Jesus' rejection. It suggests that even His immediate family, including His brothers, did not initially believe in Him (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). This rejection fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant who is despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>is a prophet without honor.&#8221;</b><br>This statement connects Jesus to the Old Testament tradition of prophets who were often rejected by their own people (e.g., Jeremiah, Elijah). It underscores the theme of prophetic rejection and foreshadows the ultimate rejection Jesus would face in His crucifixion. This phrase also serves as a type of Christ, illustrating His role as the ultimate prophet who speaks God's truth but is not honored by His own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching in His hometown.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>A messenger chosen by God to deliver His word, often facing rejection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hometown.htm">Hometown</a></b><br>Refers to Nazareth, where Jesus grew up and where He is currently teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/relatives.htm">Relatives</a></b><br>Jesus' family members, who are part of the community in Nazareth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a></b><br>The immediate family and close community of Jesus, who are familiar with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_rejection.htm">Understanding Rejection</a></b><br>Jesus' experience teaches us that rejection is a common experience for those who follow God's calling.

Perseverance and consistent love can open hearts over time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a prophet without honor.</b><p>&#8226; By calling Himself a prophet, Jesus aligns with the line of spokesmen sent by God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Without honor&#8221; means lacking respect, credibility, and acceptance&#8212;echoing <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>: &#8220;He was despised and rejected by men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The pattern runs through Scripture: Jeremiah was beaten and imprisoned (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>); Amos was told to leave Israel (<a href="/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Nevertheless, divine authority is undiminished.

Familiarity clouded Nazareth&#8217;s vision, yet their unbelief could not lessen His identity as the promised Prophet. The verse invites modern readers to guard against casual familiarity with Christ, to honor Him wholeheartedly at home as well as abroad, and to remain steadfast when rejection comes from the circles closest to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country</span>, etc. One reason for this is that it is almost natural for persons to hold of less account than <span class="accented">they</span> ought, those with whom they have been brought up and have lived on familiar terms. Prophets are commonly least regarded, and often most envied, in their own country. However unworthy may be the feeling, the inhabitants of a district, or members of a community, do not like to see one of themselves put above them, more especially a junior over a senior, or a man of humble origin over a man well born. But it should be remembered that God abhors the envious, and will withhold the wonders of his grace from those who grudge his gifts to others. The men of Nazareth, when they saw Christ eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and working at his trade, like others, despised him when he claimed respect and reverence as a Prophet, and especially because his relations according to the flesh were of humble condition; and Joseph more particularly, whom they supposed to be his real father, for they could not imagine or believe that he was born of a virgin, and had God alone for his Father. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
