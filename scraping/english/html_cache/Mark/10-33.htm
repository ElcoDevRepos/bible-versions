Jerusalem is significant as the place where many key events in Jesus' life and ministry occur, including His crucifixion and resurrection. The phrase "going up" reflects the geographical reality that Jerusalem is situated on a hill, but it also carries spiritual significance, as going to Jerusalem often meant going to a place of divine encounter and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes.</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term that Jesus frequently uses for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. Being "delivered over" suggests betrayal and the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. The chief priests and scribes were the religious leaders responsible for maintaining Jewish law and tradition, highlighting the irony that those who should recognize the Messiah are the ones who reject Him.<p><b>They will condemn Him to death</b><br>This phrase foreshadows the legal and religious trial that Jesus will face. The condemnation by the Jewish leaders fulfills prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant being "cut off from the land of the living." The act of condemning Jesus to death underscores the rejection of His messianic claims and the fulfillment of His role as the sacrificial Lamb.<p><b>and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles.</b><br>The involvement of the Gentiles, specifically the Romans, in Jesus' death is significant. It fulfills Jesus' earlier predictions and prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which describes the suffering of the righteous one at the hands of non-Jews. This transfer of Jesus to the Gentiles also symbolizes the broader scope of His mission, which includes salvation for all nations, not just Israel.
