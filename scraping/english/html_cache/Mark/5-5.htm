It suggests a state of perpetual suffering, without relief or respite. In biblical terms, the concept of "night and day" often signifies completeness or totality, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous meditate on the law "day and night."<p><b>in the tombs and in the mountains</b><br>The tombs were often located outside of towns and were considered unclean places according to Jewish law (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). The mountains, or hills, in this context, represent isolation and desolation. The man's dwelling in these places highlights his separation from society and the spiritual desolation he experienced. This setting also foreshadows the resurrection, as Jesus Himself would later be laid in a tomb and rise again, conquering death and uncleanness.<p><b>he kept crying out</b><br>The continuous crying out indicates deep anguish and torment. This behavior is consistent with the presence of demonic influence, as seen in other biblical accounts where demons cause physical and emotional distress (<a href="/luke/9-39.htm">Luke 9:39</a>). The man's cries can be seen as a distorted echo of the cries for deliverance found throughout the Psalms, reflecting a deep, albeit misdirected, longing for salvation.<p><b>and cutting himself with stones</b><br>Self-harm in this context is a manifestation of the demonic oppression the man was under. It reflects the destructive nature of sin and evil, which seeks to mar the image of God in humanity. The act of cutting with stones may also symbolize the futility of trying to find relief through self-destructive means. In contrast, Jesus, the "stone the builders rejected" (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>), offers true healing and restoration. This behavior also parallels the practices of the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>, who cut themselves in a frenzy, highlighting the contrast between the false gods and the true God who brings peace and healing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demoniac.htm">The Demoniac</a></b><br>A man possessed by an unclean

class="vheading2">What Does Mark 5:5 Mean</div><b>Night and day</b><p>- Constant, uninterrupted torment is in view. <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a> notes that Satan &#8220;accuses them day and night,&#8221; and <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> warns that the devil is always prowling. The man&#8217;s misery never paused until Jesus arrived (cf. <a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>, where God hears those who cry to Him &#8220;day and night&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the tombs</b><p>- Tombs represent death and ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). <a href="/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a> portrays rebels who &#8220;sit among the graves,&#8221; echoing this man&#8217;s condition. His dwelling among corpses pictures the spiritual state of everyone apart from Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in the mountains</b><p>- The mountains highlight isolation. <a href="/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a> adds that the demon drove him into &#8220;solitary places.&#8221; Separation from community is a classic tactic of evil (cf. <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a>). Yet Jesus often meets people in lonely heights (<a href="/mark/6-46.htm">Mark 6:46</a>), proving no terrain is beyond His reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He kept crying out</b><p>- The screams were ongoing, showing relentless anguish. <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> says, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears,&#8221; but here the cries go unheard until Jesus steps in. Similar demonic outbursts appear in <a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>. <a href="/psalms/107-6.htm">Psalm 107:6</a> reminds us that true deliverance begins when distress is directed to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And cutting himself with stones</b><p>- Self-harm reveals the destructive aim of the enemy. <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>: &#8220;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.&#8221; <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> forbids self-mutilation, so the man&#8217;s wounds add ritual defilement to his pain. The prophets of Baal did likewise (<a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>), linking self-injury to demonic influence. Only Christ rescues from such bondage (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-5.htm">Mark 5:5</a> sketches total captivity: ceaseless agony, life among the dead, isolation, desperate cries, and self-destruction. The verse underscores both the cruelty of demonic oppression and humanity&#8217;s utter helplessness without Jesus. It sets the stage for the Savior who crosses a storm, confronts a legion, and restores a shattered man&#8212;showing that no darkness is too deep and no bondage too strong for the liberating power of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Cutting himself with stones.</span>--This feature, again, is given only by St. Mark.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Night</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#965;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(nyktos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3571.htm">Strong's 3571: </a> </span><span class="str2">The night, night-time.
