In a cultural context where women often had limited roles, their presence is significant. These women, unlike many of the male disciples who fled, remained near Jesus during His crucifixion, demonstrating their devotion. Watching from a distance may indicate both their desire to be near Jesus and the restrictions placed on them by the Roman authorities or the crowd. This scene fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>, where the psalmist speaks of friends and companions standing aloof during times of distress.<p><b>Among them were Mary Magdalene,</b><br>Mary Magdalene is a prominent figure in the Gospels, known for her deliverance from seven demons by Jesus (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>). Her presence at the crucifixion, burial, and resurrection underscores her significant role in Jesus' ministry. Her loyalty and dedication are evident as she is one of the first to witness the resurrected Christ (<a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>). Her inclusion here highlights the transformative power of Jesus' ministry and the important role women played in the early church.<p><b>Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses,</b><br>This Mary is often identified as Mary, the wife of Clopas (<a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>), and possibly the sister-in-law of Mary, the mother of Jesus. James the younger, also known as James the Less, was one of the twelve apostles (<a href="/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>). The mention of her sons connects her to the early Christian community and highlights the familial ties within the group of Jesus' followers. Her presence at the crucifixion indicates her steadfast faith and support for Jesus' ministry.<p><b>and Salome.</b><br>Salome is traditionally understood to be the mother of the sons of Zebedee, James and John (<a href="/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>). Her presence at the crucifixion, along with her sons' close association with Jesus, suggests her active involvement in His ministry. Salome's request for her sons to sit at Jesus' right and left in His kingdom (<a href="/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35-37</a>) shows her belief in Jesus' messianic role, despite her misunderstanding of His mission. Her presence here reflects her continued support and faithfulness to Jesus, even in His suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, from whom He cast out seven demons.

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-55.htm">Matthew 27:55</a>) says that there were many.

The mother of our Lord had been there until the time when, having with St. John crept as near the cross of Jesus as she might venture, she was consigned by our Lord to St. John's care, and taken away by him. St. Mark mentions this to show the faith and love of these holy women, because in the very presence of the enemies of Christ they dared to stand by his cross, and shrank not from testifying their piety and devotion. St. John says that they stood near. He must have known; for at one time at least he was standing near. St. Matthew and St. Mark speak of them as at a distance. They were at a distance, no doubt, for the most part, as compared with the soldiers, whose duty it was to be in close attendance and to keep the people off. But these devoted women came as near as they could, so as to see and hear their Lord. Perhaps they were sometimes further off and sometimes nearer, as they saw opportunity, or as the humor of the officials suffered them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there were</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7982;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
