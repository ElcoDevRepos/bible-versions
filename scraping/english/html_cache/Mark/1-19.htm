The Sea of Galilee was a hub of fishing activity, and Jesus' choice to call His disciples from this area highlights His connection to everyday life and work. This movement also signifies the progression of His ministry as He gathers His followers.<p><b>He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John</b><br>James and John, often referred to as the "Sons of Thunder" (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm">Mark 3:17</a>), were part of Jesus' inner circle, along with Peter. Their father, Zebedee, was likely a man of some means, as indicated by the presence of hired men (<a href="/mark/1-20.htm">Mark 1:20</a>). The calling of these brothers emphasizes the theme of family and community in the early Christian movement. Their inclusion in Jesus' closest disciples underscores their importance in the early Church, with John traditionally credited as the author of the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation.<p><b>They were in a boat</b><br>The boat is a symbol of their profession as fishermen, a common occupation around the Sea of Galilee. This setting underscores the humble beginnings of Jesus' disciples, who were ordinary men called to an extraordinary mission. The boat also serves as a metaphor for the Church, a vessel carrying the message of the Gospel.<p><b>mending their nets</b><br>Mending nets was a routine task for fishermen, necessary for maintaining their livelihood. This detail highlights the disciples' diligence and readiness to respond to Jesus' call. The act of mending can also symbolize restoration and preparation, themes central to Jesus' ministry. The imagery of nets is later used by Jesus when He tells His disciples they will become "fishers of men" (<a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a>), indicating their future role in gathering people into the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is calling His disciples to follow Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_son_of_zebedee.htm">James son of Zebedee</a></b><br>- One of the first disciples called by Jesus, later known as one of the "Sons of Thunder" due to his zealous nature.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>- Brother of James, also called by Jesus, who becomes the beloved disciple and author of the Gospel of John, three epistles, and Revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebedee.htm">Zebedee</a></b><br>- The father of James and John, a fisherman by trade, indicating a family business.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>- Represents the setting of their daily work and livelihood, which they are called to leave behind to follow Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_follow_jesus.htm">The Call to Follow Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus calls ordinary people in their everyday lives to follow Him.

St. Mark here mentions <span class="cmt_word">that they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This mention of the "hired servants" is peculiar to St. Mark. He often follows the narrative of St. Matthew; but he adds little details such as this, here and there, which show that he knew St. Matthew's narrative to be true, and also that he was an independent witness. This circumstance here incidentally mentioned shows that there was a difference in position in life between Zebedee's family and that of Simon and Andrew. It appears that all Jews had free right of fishing in the sea of Galilee, which abounded in fish. Zebedee, therefore, whose home seems to have been at Jerusalem, had a fishing establishment in Galilee, probably managed by his partners, Andrew and Simon, during his absence. But he would naturally visit the establishment from time to time With his sons, and especially before the great festivals, when a larger supply of fish than usual would be required for the visitors crowding to Jerusalem at that time.
