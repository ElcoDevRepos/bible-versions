This scene takes place in Jerusalem during the Passover festival, a time when the city was filled with Jewish pilgrims. The crowd's behavior is reminiscent of the mob mentality seen in other biblical events, such as the rebellion against Moses in the wilderness (Numbers 16).<p><b>and began asking Pilate</b><br>Pilate, the Roman governor, held the authority to release a prisoner during the festival, a custom meant to appease the Jewish populace. The crowd's approach to Pilate highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish expectations. Pilate's role is crucial, as he is depicted as a reluctant participant in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, echoing the prophecy of a suffering servant who would be rejected by His own people (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>to keep his custom</b><br>The custom of releasing a prisoner during Passover is not documented outside the Gospels, but it aligns with Roman practices of placating subjugated peoples. This act of clemency was likely intended to maintain peace and order. The crowd's insistence on this custom underscores their desire for a political savior, contrasting with Jesus' mission as a spiritual redeemer. This moment foreshadows the ultimate rejection of Jesus as the Messiah, fulfilling prophecies of His suffering and death (Psalm 22, <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people present at the trial of Jesus, likely consisting of various individuals from Jerusalem and surrounding areas.

Pilate has just offered to release a prisoner as part of a Passover tradition (<a href="/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6-7</a>). By using &#8220;So,&#8221; Mark signals a cause-and-effect flow: because Pilate spoke of the custom, something stirred in the crowd.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a> sets the same scene, &#8220;But it is your custom that I release to you one at the Passover&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The narrative pivots here&#8212;from Pilate&#8217;s proposal to the people&#8217;s response&#8212;showing human responsibility alongside God&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the crowd went up</b><p>Crowds have been a recurring feature in Mark, often fickle and easily swayed (<a href="/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9-10</a>; 14:43). Here they move toward Pilate&#8217;s judgment seat inside the governor&#8217;s headquarters.<p>&#8226; Their motion &#8220;went up&#8221; pictures eagerness; they do not passively wait.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the same masses welcomed Jesus with &#8220;Hosanna!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/11-9.htm">Mark 11:9</a>). Now they gather with a very different intention&#8212;underscoring how quickly public sentiment can shift when truth confronts human expectations (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and began asking Pilate</b><p>Their request is polite on the surface yet charged with manipulation underneath.<p>&#8226; Pilate, the Roman prefect, holds power of life and death, but he finds himself pressured by popular opinion (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18</a> records, &#8220;But they all cried out together, &#8216;Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!&#8217;&#8221;. Mark highlights the start of that demand.<p>&#8226; The moment exposes human nature: people prefer a political deliverer of their own choosing to the true Deliverer God has sent (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to keep his custom</b><p>The &#8220;custom&#8221; was the annual release of one prisoner during Passover (<a href="/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a>). The crowd is not asking for justice but for tradition&#8212;whatever serves their immediate desire.<p>&#8226; Ironically, the feast commemorates Israel&#8217;s liberation from bondage (<a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>), yet the people choose Barabbas and reject the only One who can free them from sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Pilate&#8217;s custom, though secular, becomes the stage on which God&#8217;s redemptive plan unfolds, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>.<p>&#8226; Even the enemy&#8217;s schemes serve God&#8217;s purpose: Christ, &#8220;handed over by God&#8217;s deliberate plan and foreknowledge,&#8221; is crucified by lawless men (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/15-8.htm">Mark 15:8</a> shows a crowd propelled by tradition and peer pressure, stepping forward to prod Pilate into releasing a prisoner. Their action reveals the volatile nature of human allegiance and sets in motion the formal rejection of Jesus. Yet, amid their plea for the governor&#8217;s customary release, God is orchestrating the ultimate Passover substitution: the innocent Lamb taking the place of the guilty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">As he had ever done unto them.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">as he ever used to do unto them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the multitude went up and Began to ask him to do</span> <span class="cmt_word">as he was wont to do unto them.</span> <span class="accented">Went up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>).
