John the Baptist's disciples likely fasted as part of their commitment to his message of repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. The Pharisees, a religious sect known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions, also practiced fasting regularly, often twice a week, as a demonstration of piety. This practice is rooted in the Old Testament, where fasting is seen during times of national crisis or personal penitence (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29-31</a>, <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>). The mention of both groups highlights the religious diversity and expectations of the time.<p><b>So people came to Jesus and asked,</b><br>The people approaching Jesus indicates His growing reputation as a teacher and leader. This question reflects the curiosity and sometimes skepticism of the crowds regarding Jesus' teachings and practices. It also shows the communal nature of religious life in first-century Judea, where public actions and religious observances were often scrutinized and discussed. This interaction takes place in Galilee, a region known for its diverse population and varied religious practices.<p><b>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t Your disciples fast like John&#8217;s disciples and those of the Pharisees?&#8221;</b><br>The question underscores a perceived inconsistency in religious observance. Fasting was a visible sign of devotion, and the absence of this practice among Jesus' disciples could be seen as a lack of piety or seriousness about spiritual matters. This inquiry sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the newness of His ministry and the coming of the Kingdom of God, which often challenged existing religious norms. The question also reflects a broader theme in the Gospels: the tension between Jesus' teachings and the established religious practices of the time. This moment foreshadows Jesus' role as the Bridegroom, a type of Christ, who brings a new covenant, as seen in subsequent verses and other Gospel accounts (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14-17</a>, <a href="/luke/5-33.htm">Luke 5:33-39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john's_disciples.htm">John's Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of John the Baptist, who practiced fasting as a sign of repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>A Jewish religious group known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions, including regular fasting as a religious duty.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, whose actions and teachings often challenged traditional Jewish practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fasting.htm">Fasting</a></b><br>A religious practice involving abstaining from food, often associated with mourning, repentance, or seeking God's favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_questioners.htm">The Questioners</a></b><br>Unspecified people who approached Jesus, reflecting the curiosity and confusion about His different approach to religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_fasting_in_context.htm">Understanding Fasting in Context</a></b><br>Fasting was a common religious practice in Judaism, often associated with mourning or repentance.

The verse exposes two kinds of fasting&#8212;one rooted in genuine repentance, another in self-display&#8212;while introducing Jesus as the defining factor for true devotion. Because He is present, the normal rhythms of religious life are reordered. His arrival means joy now, fasting later (<a href="/mark/2-19.htm">Mark 2:19&#8211;20</a>). The passage invites believers to practice spiritual disciplines from a heart that recognizes Christ&#8217;s authority and celebrates His nearness, not to impress others but to walk faithfully with the Bridegroom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18-22) <span class= "bld">And the disciples of John. . . . used to fast.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">were fasting.</span> See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14-17</a>. The only difference in detail between the two accounts is that in St. Matthew the disciples of John are more definitely specified as being the questioners.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The first sentence of this verse should be rendered thus: <span class="cmt_word">And the disciples</span> <span class="cmt_word">of John and the Pharisees were fasting</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x1ffd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). In all the synoptic Gospels we find this incident following closely upon what goes before. It is not improbable that the Pharisees and the disciples of John were fasting at the very time when Matthew gave his feast. This was not one of the fasts prescribed by the Law; had it been so, it would have been observed by our Lord. There were, however, fasts observed by the Pharisees which were not required by the Law; there were two in particular of a voluntary nature, mentioned by the Pharisee (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>), where he says, "I fast twice in the week." It was a custom, observed by the stricter Pharisees, but not of legal obligation. It was not correct to say, but thy disciples fast not. They fasted, no doubt, but in a different spirit; they did not fast to be seen of men - they followed the higher teaching of their Master. It is remarkable to find the disciples of John here associated with the Pharisees. John was now in prison in the fort of Machaerus. It is possible that jealousy of the increasing influence of Christ may have led John's disciples to associate themselves with the Pharisees. The point of this particular attack upon Christ was this: It is as though they said, "You claim to be a new teacher sent from God, a teacher of a more perfect religion. How is it, then, that we are fasting, while your disciples are eating and drinking?" The disciples of John more especially may have urged this out of zeal for their master.
