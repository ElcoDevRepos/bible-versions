The instruction to "go" signifies immediate action, emphasizing the resurrection's pivotal role in Christian faith. The mention of "His disciples and Peter" is significant. Peter, having denied Jesus three times, is specifically named, indicating a message of forgiveness and restoration. This reflects the grace and mercy central to the Gospel. The inclusion of Peter also underscores his leadership role among the apostles, which is later evident in the Acts of the Apostles.<p><b>&#8216;He is going ahead of you into Galilee.</b><br>Galilee is a region of great significance in Jesus' ministry, often referred to as "Galilee of the Gentiles" (<a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). It is where Jesus performed many miracles and teachings, and it symbolizes the outreach of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries. The phrase "going ahead of you" suggests Jesus' role as a shepherd leading His flock, a theme consistent with His teachings (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). This also fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction of His resurrection and meeting with the disciples in Galilee (<a href="/mark/14-28.htm">Mark 14:28</a>), demonstrating His foreknowledge and divine plan.<p><b>There you will see Him,</b><br>This promise of seeing Jesus in Galilee is a reassurance of His physical resurrection, countering any claims that His appearances were merely spiritual or visionary. The physicality of the resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, affirming Jesus' victory over death and His divine nature. This encounter in Galilee would serve to strengthen the disciples' faith and prepare them for their mission to spread the Gospel.<p><b>just as He told you.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the reliability and truth of Jesus' words. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus predicts His death and resurrection (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:34), and this fulfillment reinforces His prophetic authority. It serves as a reminder of the trustworthiness of Scripture and God's faithfulness to His promises. This assurance would have been crucial for the disciples as they faced persecution and spread the message of Christ's resurrection to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who delivers the news of Jesus' resurrection to the women at the tomb.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who came to anoint His body and were the first to hear of His resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are instructed to go to Galilee to see the risen Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>Specifically mentioned among the disciples, highlighting his restoration after denying Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus began His ministry and where He will appear to His disciples post-resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_galilee.htm">The Importance of Galilee</a></b><br>Galilee is not just a geographical location but a symbol of new beginnings and fulfillment of prophecy.

The angel redirects fearful followers to active faith, singles out Peter for restoration, affirms Jesus&#8217; leadership, guarantees a bodily reunion in Galilee, and grounds everything in the proven truthfulness of His word.

Therefore he is specially named, lest he should despair on account of his denial." It was evidently intended as a special message of comfort to Peter. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>) records the personal appearance of our Lord first to Peter. Here St. Mark, with characteristic modesty, keeps Peter in the background. In <a href="/mark/14-28.htm">Mark 14:28</a> our Lord is recorded to have said, "After I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee." He would go before them as their Shepherd, and lead them to that part of the Holy Land which, as he had honored it before his resurrection, so he would honor it again now. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/16-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
