However, the act of bringing children to Jesus indicates the recognition of His authority and compassion. This reflects the Jewish tradition of seeking blessings from a rabbi or holy man. The act of bringing children to Jesus also symbolizes the faith and trust of the parents or guardians in His power and goodness.<p><b>for Him to place His hands on them</b><br>The laying on of hands was a common practice in Jewish culture for blessing, healing, and imparting authority. In the Old Testament, this gesture is seen in the blessing of Jacob's sons by Isaac (Genesis 27) and the commissioning of Joshua by Moses (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). Here, it signifies Jesus' willingness to bless and accept those who are often marginalized or overlooked, emphasizing His role as a compassionate and approachable Savior.<p><b>and the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</b><br>The disciples' rebuke reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and the value He places on all individuals, regardless of age or status. This action may have been influenced by cultural norms that did not prioritize children. However, it contrasts with Jesus' teachings on humility and the kingdom of God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3-4</a>, where He emphasizes the importance of becoming like little children to enter the kingdom. This moment serves as a teaching opportunity for Jesus to correct His disciples and highlight the inclusivity of His message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, known for His teachings and miracles.

The imposition of hands implies a formal benediction; the invoking of Divine grace upon them, that they might grow up into wise and holy men and women. Why did the disciples rebuke them? Perhaps because they thought it unworthy of so great a Prophet, whose business was rather that of instructing those of full age, to be spending his time upon little children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[People] were bringing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#941;&#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(prosepheron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4374.htm">Strong's 4374: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and phero; to bear towards, i.e. Lead to, tender, treat.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] little children</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(paidia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3813.htm">Strong's 3813: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter diminutive of pais; a childling, i.e., an infant, or a half-grown boy or girl; figuratively, an immature Christian.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to [Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
