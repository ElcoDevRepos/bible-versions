In the context of <a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees who questioned why He was eating with tax collectors and sinners. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry, which often involved challenging the religious leaders and their interpretations of the law. The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the law and often looked down on those who did not follow it as rigorously.<p><b>It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</b><br>Here, Jesus uses a metaphor to explain His mission. The "healthy" refers to those who perceive themselves as righteous, often the religious leaders, while the "sick" symbolizes sinners and those marginalized by society. This metaphor highlights Jesus' role as a healer, not just physically but spiritually. In the cultural context, doctors were sought by those in need of healing, and Jesus positions Himself as the spiritual physician for those who recognize their need for salvation.<p><b>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.</b><br>This statement underscores the purpose of Jesus' ministry: to reach out to those who are aware of their sinfulness and need for repentance. The "righteous" here can be seen as those who are self-righteous, believing they have no need for Jesus' message. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes God's grace and mercy towards the humble and repentant. It also connects to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah coming to save the lost, such as in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of bringing good news to the afflicted.

So that it is as though Christ said, "I who am sent from heaven by the Father, that I might be the Physician of the souls of sinners, am not defiled by their sins and spiritual diseases when I converse with them; but rather I cure and heal them, which is alike for my glory and for their good, and so much the more, the greater their sins.
