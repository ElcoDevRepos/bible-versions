Herod's sorrow indicates a deep internal conflict, as he was troubled by the request made by Herodias's daughter. This sorrow highlights Herod's awareness of the moral implications of his actions, as he respected John the Baptist and recognized him as a righteous and holy man (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>). The sorrow also reflects the tension between Herod's personal convictions and the political and social pressures he faced.<p><b>but because of his oaths</b><br>Herod had made a rash promise to Herodias's daughter after she pleased him with her dance, offering her anything she wished, up to half his kingdom (<a href="/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>). In the cultural context of the time, oaths were considered binding and sacred, and breaking them could lead to a loss of honor and credibility. Herod's adherence to his oath, despite his sorrow, underscores the weight that such promises held in ancient Jewish and Greco-Roman societies.<p><b>and his guests</b><br>The presence of guests at Herod's banquet added to the pressure he felt to fulfill his oath. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, maintaining one's honor and reputation in front of others was paramount. The guests likely included high-ranking officials and influential figures, making Herod's decision a public matter. This social dynamic illustrates the theme of peer pressure and the fear of losing face, which can lead individuals to act against their better judgment.<p><b>he did not want to refuse her</b><br>Herod's reluctance to refuse Herodias's daughter demonstrates his internal struggle between doing what he knew was right and maintaining his public image. This phrase highlights the moral weakness and lack of true authority in Herod's character, as he prioritizes his reputation over justice. The decision to grant her request ultimately leads to the beheading of John the Baptist, a pivotal moment that foreshadows the rejection and suffering of Jesus Christ. This event also serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the potential consequences of standing for truth in a world that often values power and prestige over righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, known for his role in the execution of John the Baptist.

We cannot suppose that this was a pretended grief. The true reason is doubtless to be found in the relentless animosity of Herodias. Herod must have known well that he could not be bound by his oath in reference to a petition so unreasonable and so iniquitous. Nevertheless he thought that "the words of a king were law." St. Augustine says, "The girl dances; the mother rages. A rash oath is made amidst the excitement and the voluptuous indulgence of the feast; and the savage desires of Herodias are fulfilled." <span class="cmt_word">For the sake of his oaths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); the plural shows that he repeated the rash promise once and again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
