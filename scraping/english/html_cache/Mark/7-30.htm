Her faith is demonstrated by her action of returning home, trusting in Jesus' word without needing physical evidence. This reflects the biblical principle of faith in action, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<p><b>and found her child lying on the bed</b><br>The detail of the child lying on the bed suggests a state of rest and peace, contrasting with the turmoil caused by demonic possession. In biblical times, a bed was a place of rest and recovery, symbolizing the restoration of the child's well-being. This imagery aligns with <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where God leads His people to rest, indicating divine care and restoration.<p><b>and the demon was gone</b><br>This phrase confirms the complete and authoritative power of Jesus over demonic forces.
