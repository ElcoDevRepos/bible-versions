It served as a central hub for Jesus' ministry in Galilee. Archaeological excavations have uncovered a synagogue and other structures from the time of Jesus, confirming its historical importance. Capernaum is often referred to as Jesus' "own city" (<a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>) and was the home of several of His disciples, including Peter, Andrew, James, and John. This move to Capernaum marks a strategic shift in Jesus' ministry, as it was a populous area with a mix of Jews and Gentiles, providing a broad audience for His teachings.<p><b>and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath</b><br>The synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life, serving as a place for prayer, reading of the Scriptures, and teaching. The Sabbath, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, was a day of rest and worship, making it an ideal time for Jesus to reach a gathered audience. Jesus' immediate entry into the synagogue demonstrates His commitment to teaching and His respect for Jewish customs. This action also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who would proclaim good news to the poor and freedom for the captives, often beginning His ministry in synagogues.<p><b>and began to teach</b><br>Jesus' teaching in the synagogue was characterized by authority and wisdom, often contrasting with the teachings of the scribes and Pharisees. His teachings were rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures, yet He brought new insights and interpretations that challenged traditional understandings. This moment marks the beginning of His public ministry, where He would reveal the nature of God's Kingdom and His role as the Messiah. His teaching often included parables, direct instruction, and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, establishing Him as the ultimate Teacher and Prophet like Moses, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who enters the synagogue to teach.

St. Mark is fond of the historical "present "tense, which often adds life and energy to his narrative. Who go into Capernaum? Our Lord and these four disciples, the elementary Church of God, the nucleus of that spiritual influence which is to spread wider and wider unto the perfect day. It does not follow that this going into Capernaum took place on the same day. They would not have been fishing on the sabbath day. The synagogue here spoken of was the gift of the good centurion of whom we read in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5</a>) and St. Luke (<a href="/luke/7-2.htm">Luke 7:2</a>). Thus the first synagogue in which our Lord preached was the gift of a generous Gentile officer. It was an emblem of the union of Jews and Gentiles in one fold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus and His companions] went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(eisporeuontai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1531.htm">Strong's 1531: </a> </span><span class="str2">To journey in(to), I go in(to), enter, intervene.
