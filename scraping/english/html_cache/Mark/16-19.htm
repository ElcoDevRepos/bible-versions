The Gospels record several instances where Jesus appeared to His followers after His resurrection, providing them with final instructions and affirming His identity as the risen Lord. This period was crucial for preparing the disciples for their mission to spread the Gospel. The emphasis on Jesus speaking to them highlights the importance of His teachings and the authority with which He imparted His final words.<p><b>He was taken up into heaven</b><br>The ascension of Jesus is a pivotal event in Christian theology, marking the end of His earthly ministry and His return to the Father. This event fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and is also referenced in <a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>, where it is described in more detail. The ascension signifies Jesus' exaltation and the completion of His redemptive work. It also sets the stage for the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, as Jesus promised in <a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>. The ascension underscores the divine nature of Christ and His authority over heaven and earth.<p><b>and sat down at the right hand of God</b><br>Sitting at the right hand of God is a position of honor and authority, signifying Jesus' role as the sovereign ruler and intercessor for humanity. This imagery is rooted in Jewish tradition, where the right hand symbolizes power and privilege. The phrase echoes <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> and is affirmed in other New Testament passages such as <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a> and <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>. It indicates that Jesus' work of atonement is complete, and He now reigns as King and High Priest, interceding on behalf of believers. This position also anticipates His future return to judge the living and the dead, as promised in <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who, after His resurrection, ascends to heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who witnessed His ascension and received His final instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The spiritual realm where God resides, and to which Jesus ascended.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_right_hand_of_god.htm">The Right Hand of God</a></b><br>A position of honor and authority, signifying Jesus' divine status and His role as intercessor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_christ.htm">The Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' ascension and position at the right hand of God affirm His authority over all creation.

Here is another interval. The evangelist has gathered up some few of the most important words and sayings of Christ; and now he takes his reader to Bethany, the scene of our Lord's ascension. It has been well observed (see Bishop Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that the fact of the Ascension is gradually revealed in the Gospels. St. Matthew does not mention it at all. St. Mark refers to it in this brief and very simple manner. But St. Luke describes it with great fullness, both in his Gospel and in the Acts of the Apostles, throughout which book he leads his readers to contemplate Christ as ascended into heaven, and as sitting at God's right hand, and as ruling the Church and the world from the throne of his glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/16-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
