This follows a question from the Pharisees intended to test Him (<a href="/mark/10-2.htm">Mark 10:2</a>). Jesus often used such moments to clarify God's intentions and laws, emphasizing the importance of understanding the heart of the law rather than just its letter.<p><b>Whoever divorces his wife</b><br>Divorce was a common practice in Jewish society, regulated by Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>). However, the interpretation and application of these laws varied, with some schools of thought, like that of Rabbi Hillel, allowing divorce for trivial reasons. Jesus challenges these interpretations by pointing back to God's original design for marriage as a lifelong covenant (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><b>and marries another woman</b><br>Remarriage after divorce was also a debated topic. In Jewish culture, a man could remarry after divorcing his wife, but Jesus introduces a radical teaching that challenges the permissibility of remarriage under these circumstances. This reflects the seriousness with which Jesus views the marriage covenant, aligning with the prophetic imagery of God&#8217;s unending faithfulness to Israel despite their unfaithfulness (<a href="/hosea/3.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>).<p><b>commits adultery against her</b><br>Jesus elevates the status of women by acknowledging that a man can commit adultery against his wife, a concept not commonly recognized in the patriarchal society of the time. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical narrative that upholds the sanctity and exclusivity of the marriage relationship (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). It also reflects the prophetic imagery of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, where idolatry is often depicted as spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing teaching on the sanctity of marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are present and receiving this teaching.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The institution being discussed, highlighting its sacred and binding nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The act being addressed by Jesus, emphasizing its moral and spiritual implications.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery.htm">Adultery</a></b><br>The sin that Jesus associates with divorcing and remarrying, underscoring the seriousness of the act.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, intended to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_divorce.htm">The Seriousness of Divorce</a></b><br>Divorce is not to be taken lightly, as it disrupts the divine intention for marriage and can lead to sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adultery_and_its_consequences.htm">Adultery and Its Consequences</a></b><br>Remarrying after divorce, except in cases of marital unfaithfulness, is considered adultery, highlighting the moral gravity of such actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_and_faithfulness.htm">Commitment and Faithfulness</a></b><br>Believers are called to uphold their marriage vows with commitment and faithfulness, reflecting God's covenantal love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_reconciliation.htm">Seeking Reconciliation</a></b><br>In cases of marital discord, efforts should be made towards reconciliation and healing, in line with biblical principles.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_10_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 10:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_11_on_divorce_remarriage_seriousness.htm">How does Mark 10:11 define the seriousness of divorce and remarriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Implication_of_adultery_in_Mark_10_11.htm">What does "commits adultery" in Mark 10:11 imply about marital faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_11_s_role_in_honoring_marriage_vows.htm">How can Mark 10:11 guide Christians in honoring their marriage vows today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Contrast_Mark_10_11_with_Matthew_5_32.htm">Compare Mark 10:11 with Matthew 5:32.

The man&#8217;s new union does not erase his obligation; it multiplies his guilt.<p>&#8211; The verb &#8220;commits&#8221; is present tense: ongoing sin until repentance.

To divorce a faithful spouse and enter a new union is to violate that covenant and sin against both God and the abandoned partner. The verse calls believers to honor marriage with lifelong fidelity, reflecting Christ&#8217;s unwavering commitment to His bride, the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Committeth adultery against</span> <span class="cmt_word">her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>).
