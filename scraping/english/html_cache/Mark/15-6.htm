This custom is not documented outside the Gospels, but it aligns with Roman practices of clemency and political pragmatism. The feast refers to Passover, a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' liberation from Egyptian slavery, which draws large crowds to Jerusalem.<p><b>to release to the people</b><br>The act of releasing a prisoner to the people underscores the political dynamics at play. Pilate, the Roman governor, sought to appease the Jewish populace and prevent unrest. This gesture of releasing a prisoner was a way to placate the masses and maintain order. The people&#8217;s involvement in choosing the prisoner highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish autonomy.<p><b>a prisoner of their choosing</b><br>The choice given to the people introduces a dramatic element to the narrative, emphasizing the theme of choice and responsibility. This moment foreshadows the decision between Jesus and Barabbas, symbolizing the broader spiritual choice between the path of Christ and the path of rebellion. The concept of substitution is central here, as Jesus, the innocent, is offered in place of Barabbas, the guilty, reflecting the theological theme of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb who takes the place of sinners.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, known for his role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.

This was Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee; and Pilate, apparently convinced of our Lord's innocence, hoped to escape the responsibility of condemning an innocent man, by handing him over to Herod; for Pilate had heard that our Lord was a Galilean. Moreover, he hoped to accomplish another good result, namely, to recover the favor of Herod, which was desirable on political grounds. The first intention failed; for Herod sent our Lord back to Pilate in mockery, "arraying him in gorgeous apparel" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>).
