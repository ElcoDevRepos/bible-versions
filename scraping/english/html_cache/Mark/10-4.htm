The context is a discussion about the legality and morality of divorce, a topic of significant debate among Jewish religious leaders of the time. The Pharisees, who are responding here, often engaged in such debates to test Jesus and challenge His teachings.<p><b>&#8220;Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce</b><br>This refers to <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, where Moses provided regulations concerning divorce. The certificate of divorce was a legal document that allowed a woman to remarry, offering her some protection in a patriarchal society. The Pharisees' reference to Moses highlights the authority of the Mosaic Law in Jewish life and underscores the tension between the letter of the law and its spirit. This regulation was given due to the hardness of human hearts, as Jesus later explains, indicating a concession rather than an ideal.<p><b>and send her away.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "send her away" reflects the cultural practice of the time, where men held the primary authority in marital relationships. Divorce was relatively easy for men to initiate, often leaving women vulnerable. This practice is contrasted with Jesus' teachings on the sanctity and permanence of marriage, as He emphasizes God's original design for marriage in Genesis. The cultural context of first-century Judea, where women had limited rights, is crucial to understanding the radical nature of Jesus' subsequent teachings on marriage and divorce.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is teaching about the sanctity of marriage in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

Jesus will soon reveal that this was never God&#8217;s heart; it was a temporary allowance made because of human sinfulness. The verse highlights human tendency to look for loopholes, God&#8217;s protective concern for the vulnerable, and the solemn responsibility placed on husbands. Its ultimate purpose in the passage is to set up Jesus&#8217; reaffirmation that marriage is designed by God to be a lifelong, unbreakable covenant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
