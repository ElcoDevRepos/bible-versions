The act of heaping abuse reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, which prophesies the Messiah being scorned and despised. The public ridicule underscores the shame and humiliation Jesus endured, aligning with the cultural practice of mocking those considered criminals or blasphemers.<p><b>shaking their heads</b><br>Shaking the head was a gesture of derision and scorn in ancient Jewish culture, as seen in <a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a> and <a href="/psalms/109-25.htm">Psalm 109:25</a>. This physical expression of contempt further fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a>, where it is foretold that the suffering servant would be mocked in such a manner. It signifies the disbelief and rejection of Jesus' claims by the onlookers.<p><b>and saying, &#8220;Aha!</b><br>The exclamation "Aha!" is an expression of triumph and mockery, indicating that the onlookers believed they were witnessing the failure of Jesus' mission. This taunt reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' teachings and mission, as they perceived His crucifixion as a defeat rather than the fulfillment of His redemptive work.<p><b>You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,</b><br>This phrase refers to Jesus' statement in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>, where He spoke metaphorically of His body as the temple. The onlookers misinterpreted His words as a literal threat against the physical temple in Jerusalem. This misunderstanding highlights the spiritual blindness of the people and their inability to grasp the deeper meaning of Jesus' prophecy, which pointed to His death and resurrection. The reference to the temple also connects to the theme of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice, replacing the temple's sacrificial system with His own body.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/passersby.htm">Passersby</a></b><br>These were individuals who were present at the crucifixion of Jesus.
