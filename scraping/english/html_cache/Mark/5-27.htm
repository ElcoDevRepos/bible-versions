Her condition would have isolated her socially and religiously, as she was unable to participate in communal worship. Hearing about Jesus, she would have been aware of His reputation as a healer and miracle worker, which had spread throughout the region (<a href="/mark/1-28.htm">Mark 1:28</a>). This reflects the growing recognition of Jesus' ministry and the hope He brought to those marginalized by society.<p><b>she came up through the crowd</b><br>The act of moving through the crowd demonstrates the woman's desperation and determination. Crowds often surrounded Jesus, making it difficult for individuals to reach Him (<a href="/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9-10</a>). Her willingness to push through the throng indicates her faith and the urgency of her need. This also highlights the social dynamics of the time, where a woman, especially one considered unclean, would typically avoid such public interactions.<p><b>behind Him</b><br>Approaching Jesus from behind suggests humility and perhaps a sense of unworthiness. In the cultural context, it was not customary for women to approach men directly, especially in public. Her approach from behind may also indicate her desire to remain unnoticed due to her unclean status, as touching others would have made them ceremonially unclean as well.<p><b>and touched His cloak</b><br>Touching the cloak of Jesus is significant both culturally and theologically. In Jewish tradition, the cloak, or outer garment, often had tassels (tzitzit) as a reminder of God's commandments (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>). By touching His cloak, the woman was expressing faith in Jesus' power to heal, believing that even contact with His garment could bring about her healing. This act of faith is reminiscent of other instances where faith in Jesus' power led to miraculous healings (<a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in Jesus as the source of divine power and healing, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah who would bring restoration (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A central figure in this passage, she had been suffering from a bleeding condition for twelve years.

(<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment news of Jesus reached her ears, the seed of faith sprouted.<p>&#8226; She had lived twelve years in isolation (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-26</a>); yet a single report about the Savior cut through despair.<p>&#8226; Like the leper who said, &#8220;Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>), she believed Jesus&#8217; power was real and present.<p>Hearing did not merely inform her; it compelled her to act, showing that true faith always moves beyond mental assent (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She came up through the crowd</b><p>The press of people was no small obstacle (<a href="/mark/5-24.htm">Mark 5:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Her condition made her ceremonially unclean (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>), risking public shame.<p>&#8226; Yet she pushed forward, much as friends removed a roof to bring a paralytic to Jesus (<a href="/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly illustrates that determined seekers find an open door with the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>Her forward motion testifies that faith refuses to be stalled by fear or by the opinions of the crowd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behind Him</b><p>She did not seek center stage.<p>&#8226; Like the sinful woman who stood &#8220;behind Him at His feet&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>), she approached humbly.<p>&#8226; Her posture conveys reverence; she saw herself as unworthy to face Him directly, yet fully confident in His mercy.<p>&#8226; Jesus later turns and speaks to her (<a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30-34</a>), proving that no humble approach escapes His notice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And touched His cloak</b><p>&#8220;Everyone who touched Him was healed&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-56.htm">Mark 6:56</a>).<p>&#8226; She aimed for the fringe, echoing Israel&#8217;s practice of tassels reminding God&#8217;s people of His commands (<a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-40</a>).<p>&#8226; The act was simple, but it expressed deep conviction that even the smallest contact with Christ carries life-changing power (<a href="/matthew/14-36.htm">Matthew 14:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Her touch did not make Jesus unclean; rather, His holiness made her whole, illustrating that our infirmity never contaminates Him (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27</a> showcases faith in motion: hearing sparks belief, belief drives determined pursuit, humility shapes the approach, and a single touch receives the Savior&#8217;s life-giving power. The verse invites every reader to move from hearing about Jesus to reaching out for Him, confident that He responds with grace and healing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This woman, having heard of Jesus</span> - literally (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), <span class="accented">the things concerning Jesus - <span class="cmt_word"></span>came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment</span>.

St. Matthew tells us that "she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole." From this it appears that, though she had faith, it was an imperfect faith. She seems to have imagined that a certain magical influence was within Christ and around him. And the touching of the border of his garment (the blue fringe which the Jews were required to wear, to remind them that they were God's people) was supposed by her to convey a special virtue. Yet her faith, though imperfect, was true in its essence, and therefore was not disappointed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When [the woman] heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(akousasa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
