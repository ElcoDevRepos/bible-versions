It was a place where Jesus often stayed during His visits to Jerusalem, indicating its significance as a place of rest and refuge. Bethany was also the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead (John 11). This setting highlights the close relationships Jesus had with His followers and the hospitality He received.<p><b>reclining at the table</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, reclining at the table was a common practice during meals, especially at banquets or special occasions. This posture allowed for relaxation and conversation, indicating a setting of fellowship and intimacy. It reflects the customs of the Greco-Roman world, where meals were significant social events.<p><b>in the home of Simon the Leper</b><br>Simon the Leper is likely a man whom Jesus had healed, as lepers were typically isolated from society due to their condition. His inclusion in the narrative underscores Jesus' ministry to the marginalized and His power to heal. The fact that Jesus was welcomed into Simon's home suggests a transformation in Simon's life and status, as well as the acceptance of Jesus' ministry by those who had been healed.<p><b>a woman came with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, made of pure nard</b><br>The woman is identified in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> as Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Alabaster jars were often used to store precious ointments and perfumes, indicating the value of the contents. Nard, or spikenard, was a costly perfume imported from India, highlighting the sacrificial nature of the woman's act. This act of devotion is a profound expression of love and worship, reflecting the woman's recognition of Jesus' worth.<p><b>She broke open the jar and poured it on Jesus&#8217; head</b><br>Breaking the jar signifies the totality of the woman's gift, as the act was irreversible and complete. Pouring the perfume on Jesus' head is an anointing, a practice often associated with consecration and blessing in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, where Samuel anoints David). This act foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial, as He Himself interprets it in <a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>. It also serves as a type of Christ's anointing as King and Messiah, acknowledging His divine authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, the Son of God, who is in Bethany at this time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A village near Jerusalem, known as a place where Jesus often visited.

In Bethany&#8212;near enough to Jerusalem for the coming cross, yet intimate enough for true fellowship&#8212;Christ receives an anointing that confirms His role as Priest, King, and the spotless Lamb soon to be buried. Her wholehearted love challenges every believer to honor Him with equal surrender, trusting that nothing poured out for the Savior is ever wasted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3-9) <span class= "bld">And being in Bethany.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6-13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Ointment of spikenard.</span>--The Greek word so translated is, as the various renderings in the margin show, of doubtful import.

The Greek word implies not so much the breaking of the neck of the costly jar or flask, but the crushing it in its entirety with both her hands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And while he was in Bethany, in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">an alabaster</span>; as we say, "a glass," of a vessel made of glass - <span class="cmt_word">of ointment of spikenard very costly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head</span>. This anointing of our Lord appears to have taken place on the Saturday before Palm Sunday (see <a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). The anointing mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36</a>) evidently has reference to some previous occasion. The narrative here and in St. Matthew and St. John would lead us to the conclusion that this was a feast given by Simon - perhaps in grateful acknowledgment of the miracle which had been wrought upon Lazarus. He is called "Simon the leper," probably because he had been a leper, and had been healed by Christ, although he still retained the name of "leper," to distinguish him from others named Simon, or Simeon, a common name amongst the Jews. <span class="accented">There came a woman.</span> This woman, we learn from St. John (<a href="/john/12-2.htm">John 12:2, 3</a>), was Mary, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. The vessel, or cruse, which she had with her was made of alabaster, a kind of soft, smooth marble, which could easily be scooped out so as to form a receptacle for ointment, which, according to Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 13:3), was best preserved in vessels made of alabaster. The vessel would probably be formed with a long narrow neck, which could easily be broken, or crushed (the word in the original is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> so as to allow of a free escape for the unguent. The ointment was made of spikenard <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">nardi spicati.</span> If this is the true interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean that this ointment was made from a bearded plant mentioned by Pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:12), who says that the ointment made from this plant was most precious. The plant was called by Galen "nardi spica." Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> it would mean "genuine" ointment - ointment made from the flowers of the choicest kind of plant, pliny ('Nat. Hist.,' 12:26) says that there was an inferior article in circulation, which he calls "pseudo-nard." The Syriac Peshito Version uses an expression which means the principal, or best kind of ointment. The anointing of the head would be the more usual mark of honor. It would seem most probable that Mary first wiped the feet of Jesus, wetting them with her tears, and then wiping off the dust, and then anointing them; and that she then proceeded to break the neck of the cruse, and to pour its whole contents on his head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
