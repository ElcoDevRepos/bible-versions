Jerusalem is the center of Jewish religious life and the location where Jesus will fulfill His mission. The phrase "going up" is geographically accurate, as Jerusalem is situated on a hill, requiring travelers to ascend. This journey is also spiritually significant, as it symbolizes Jesus' ascent to His ultimate sacrifice.<p><b>Jesus was walking ahead of them</b><br>Jesus leading the way demonstrates His determination and willingness to face what lies ahead. It reflects His role as the Good Shepherd, guiding His followers. This leadership is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>, where the Servant of the Lord sets His face like flint, indicating resolute determination.<p><b>The disciples were amazed</b><br>The disciples' amazement may stem from Jesus' courage and resolve, knowing the dangers that await in Jerusalem. Their amazement could also reflect their growing understanding of Jesus' identity and mission, which often left them in awe. This reaction is consistent with other instances where Jesus' actions and teachings left the disciples astonished.<p><b>but those who followed were afraid</b><br>The fear of the followers highlights the tension and danger surrounding Jesus' journey to Jerusalem. The growing opposition from religious leaders and the potential for conflict would naturally cause fear. This fear contrasts with Jesus' calm and determined demeanor, emphasizing His divine purpose and the human apprehension of His followers.<p><b>Again Jesus took the Twelve aside</b><br>Jesus often took His disciples aside to teach them privately, indicating the importance of the message He was about to share. This private instruction underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and the Twelve, as well as their role as the foundation of the early Church. It also reflects the pattern of Jesus preparing His disciples for future challenges.<p><b>and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him</b><br>Jesus' foretelling of His suffering, death, and resurrection is a central theme in the Gospels. This prediction is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant. By revealing these events, Jesus prepares His disciples for the coming trials and assures them of His sovereignty over the unfolding plan of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, leading the way to Jerusalem, demonstrating His resolve and purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve chosen followers of Jesus, who are astonished by His determination and the unfolding events.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers.htm">Followers</a></b><br>A broader group accompanying Jesus and the disciples, experiencing fear due to the gravity of the situation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The destination of their journey, significant as the city where Jesus will face His crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road.htm">The Road</a></b><br>Symbolic of the journey and mission of Jesus, both physically and spiritually, towards fulfilling His purpose.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_leadership_and_resolve.htm">Jesus' Leadership and Resolve</a></b><br>Jesus leads by example, walking ahead of His disciples.

His determined pace amazes the Twelve and unnerves the broader followers, yet He pauses to confide in His closest disciples, unveiling the cross before it happens. The verse captures the mix of courage, wonder, and fear that surrounds the Savior&#8217;s final ascent and reassures us that every step toward Calvary was taken with full knowledge, perfect authority, and unwavering love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32-34) <span class= "bld">And they were in the way.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/20-17.htm" title="And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,">Matthew 20:17-19</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Jesus went before them.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">was leading the way.</span> The word is the same as that used in <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-31.htm" title="Whether of them two did the will of his father?

The graphic picture of the order in which the Master and the disciples were at this time travelling is eminently characteristic of St. Mark. The special mention of "the Twelve" implies that there were other disciples, possibly the Seventy of <a href="/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>, and the "devout women" of <a href="/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - They were now going up from Jericho to Jerusalem, going up with Christ to his cross and his death. He went before them, eagerly leading the way for his timid disciples, who were now beginning to realize what was about to happen, and that he would be condemned and crucified. Therefore the evangelist adds, <span class="cmt_word">they were amazed</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); the same word which is used at ver. 24. The words in the original, according to the best reading, make a distinction between the utter amazement of the disciples and the fear of the others who followed (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). St. Mark draws a distinction between the disciples, who would be following him, though at a little distance, and the mixed company, who were also following him, though at a greater distance. The whole scene is before us. Our blessed Lord, with an awful majesty on his countenance, and eager resolution in his manner, is pressing forwards to his cross. "How am I straitened until it be accomplished!" His disciples follow him, amazed and bewildered; and even the miscellaneous crowd, who no doubt gazed upon him with keen interest as the great "Prophet that should come into the world," felt that something was going to happen, though they knew not what - some-thing very dreadful; and they too were afraid. In the case of the disciples, Bede says that the chief cause of their amazement was their own imminent fear of death. They were amazed that their Master should hasten forward with such alacrity to his cross, and they feared lest they too should have to suffer with him. <span class="cmt_word">He took</span> <span class="cmt_word">again</span> <span class="cmt_word">the twelve</span>; and once more impressed upon them the dread realities which were awaiting him. They were still slow of apprehension; they required to be told again and again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[As]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they were</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7982;&#963;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;san)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
