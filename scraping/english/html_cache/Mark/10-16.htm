In the cultural context of the time, children were often seen as insignificant, yet Jesus elevates their status by embracing them. This act symbolizes the kingdom of God being open to those who come with childlike faith. The imagery of Jesus taking children in His arms can be seen as a type of His role as the Good Shepherd, who cares for and protects His flock.<p><b>placed His hands on them</b><br>The laying on of hands is a significant biblical gesture, often associated with blessing, healing, and the impartation of authority or the Holy Spirit. In the Old Testament, patriarchs laid hands on their children to confer blessings (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>). Here, Jesus' action signifies His personal attention and the bestowal of divine favor upon the children. This act also prefigures the practice of the early church in laying hands for healing and commissioning (<a href="/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6, 13</a>:3).<p><b>and blessed them</b><br>Blessing in the biblical sense involves invoking God's favor and protection. Jesus' blessing of the children underscores His role as the divine mediator who imparts God's grace. This act fulfills the prophetic expectation of the Messiah bringing blessings to all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). It also connects to the Beatitudes, where Jesus pronounces blessings on those who embody kingdom values (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3-12</a>). The blessing of children here serves as a reminder of the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, welcoming all who come with faith and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His love and care for children.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Representing innocence and humility, they are the recipients of Jesus' blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present in the context and initially rebuked people for bringing children to Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, as Jesus is traveling towards Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_children_in_god's_kingdom.htm">The Value of Children in God's Kingdom</a></b><br>Jesus' actions demonstrate that children hold a special place in God's heart and kingdom.

This is no mere figure of speech; the Lord literally draws them against His chest. The scene echoes <a href="/mark/9-36.htm">Mark 9:36-37</a>, where He &#8220;took a little child and had him stand among them, taking him in His arms.&#8221; It also reflects <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>&#8212;&#8220;He gathers the lambs in His arms and carries them close to His heart.&#8221; By cradling these children, Jesus:<p>&#8226; Demonstrates that the kingdom welcomes the powerless (<a href="/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Shows that God&#8217;s &#8220;everlasting arms&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a>) are not abstract but tangible in Christ.<p>&#8226; Gives parents&#8212;and the watching disciples&#8212;a living picture of divine tenderness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>placed His hands on them</b><p>The deliberate laying on of hands conveys personal attention and impartation. From patriarchs like Jacob crossing his hands over Ephraim and Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>) to Jesus healing the sick by touch (<a href="/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a>; <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>), Scripture treats the hand-to-head gesture as a channel of grace. Here it signals:<p>&#8226; Identification&#8212;Jesus is not detached; He links Himself with each child.<p>&#8226; Transmission&#8212;God&#8217;s favor is intentionally directed, just as <a href="/matthew/19-15.htm">Matthew 19:15</a> parallels this event: &#8220;After He had placed His hands on them, He went on from there.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Protection&#8212;the very hands that still storms and feed multitudes now rest gently on small heads.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and blessed them</b><p>Having embraced and touched them, Jesus speaks or conveys a blessing. The verb recalls Aaron&#8217;s benediction in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a> and God&#8217;s promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>. In blessing the children, Jesus:<p>&#8226; Affirms their value&#8212;&#8220;Children are indeed a heritage from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Invites them into covenant favor&#8212;&#8220;Blessed be&#8230;Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Underscores the lesson He just taught: &#8220;Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-15.htm">Mark 10:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Foreshadows the risen Lord lifting His hands to bless the disciples in <a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>, proving His desire to bless did not end with childhood encounters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a> paints a threefold portrait of Jesus&#8217; heart: He gathers (arms), He connects (hands), and He imparts (blessing). The verse assures believers of the Lord&#8217;s warm welcome, personal involvement, and spoken favor. What He did for those first-century children, He stands ready to do for all who come to Him with childlike trust today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And he took them up in his arms.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">folded them in His arms,</span> leaving the question whether they were lifted from the ground open.
