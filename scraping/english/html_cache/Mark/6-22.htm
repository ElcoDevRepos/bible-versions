Herodias was married to Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. This event took place in the context of a birthday celebration for Herod, a common occasion for feasting and entertainment in the Roman world. The dance was significant enough to captivate Herod and his guests, indicating it was more than a simple performance. This reflects the moral and cultural decadence of Herod's court, contrasting with the values of the Kingdom of God preached by Jesus.<p><b>she pleased Herod and his guests</b><br>The pleasure derived from the dance suggests a lack of moral restraint and highlights the hedonistic atmosphere of Herod's court. Herod's reaction indicates a susceptibility to sensuality and impulsive decisions, a theme consistent with his character in the Gospels. The guests, likely composed of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, were also complicit in this indulgence, reflecting the broader societal norms of the time. This moment foreshadows the tragic outcome of John the Baptist's imprisonment and eventual execution, as Herod's rash promise leads to dire consequences.<p><b>and the king said to the girl</b><br>Herod Antipas is referred to as "king," though technically a tetrarch, indicating his desire for greater recognition and authority. This title reflects his ambition and the political dynamics of the region under Roman rule. By addressing Salome directly, Herod demonstrates a lapse in judgment, influenced by the intoxicating environment of the banquet. This interaction sets the stage for the fulfillment of Herodias's vengeful scheme against John the Baptist, illustrating the interplay of personal vendettas and political power.<p><b>&#8220;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&#8221;</b><br>Herod's promise is extravagant and impulsive, reminiscent of similar vows in ancient Near Eastern and biblical traditions, such as King Ahasuerus's offer to Esther. This hyperbolic offer underscores Herod's lack of foresight and the potential for manipulation by those around him. The promise reflects the dangerous combination of power, pride, and lack of moral grounding, leading to the eventual martyrdom of John the Baptist. This narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of unchecked authority and the moral corruption inherent in Herod's rule.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The ruler of Galilee and Perea, known for his moral weaknesses and political maneuvering.

Peer approval often fuels sin (cf. <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). What entertains the crowd deadens Herod&#8217;s conscience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the king said to the girl, &#8220;Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Herod&#8217;s boastful promise echoes King Xerxes&#8217; offer to Esther&#8212;&#8220;Even up to half the kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/esther/5-3.htm">Esther 5:3</a>). Xerxes could keep such an offer safely within royal protocol; Herod turns it into a reckless oath amid drunken revelry (<a href="/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes several dangers:<p>&#8211; Rash vows (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-35</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>).<p>&#8211; Prideful displays before others (<a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>).<p>&#8211; The peril of being led by impulse rather than God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; By surrendering his authority to a girl influenced by her mother, Herod abdicates moral responsibility&#8212;foreshadowing Pilate&#8217;s later hand-washing (<a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-22.htm">Mark 6:22</a> records a literal, pivotal moment where lust, pride, and peer pressure converge. Herod&#8217;s step-daughter&#8217;s dance delights a morally compromised ruler, leading him to a rash vow that will cost John the Baptist his life. The verse warns believers to guard their hearts, resist the crowd&#8217;s applause, and submit every impulse to the unchanging authority of God&#8217;s Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The words should run thus<span class="cmt_word">: And when the daughter of Herodias herself came in</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f29;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The intention of the evangelist is to point out that it was Herodias's own daughter who danced, and not a mere professional dancing-girl. Josephus mentions that dancing-women were admitted to feasts by the Jews; and Xenophon testifies to the same custom amongst the Greeks. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
