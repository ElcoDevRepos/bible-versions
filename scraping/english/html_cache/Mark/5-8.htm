It shows Jesus' authority over demonic forces, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels. The use of "already" suggests a command that was given prior to the current narrative moment, emphasizing the immediacy and power of Jesus' words. This aligns with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus speaks with authority, such as calming the storm (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and healing the sick (<a href="/mark/2-11.htm">Mark 2:11</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Come out of this man,</b><br>The command "Come out" is direct and authoritative, reflecting Jesus' power over the spiritual realm. The phrase "this man" personalizes the encounter, highlighting Jesus' compassion and concern for individuals. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's care for each person, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, which speaks of God's intimate knowledge of each individual. The setting in the region of the Gerasenes (<a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5:1</a>) suggests a Gentile area, indicating Jesus' ministry extends beyond Jewish boundaries.<p><b>you unclean spirit!&#8221;</b><br>The term "unclean spirit" refers to a demon, emphasizing the spiritual impurity and opposition to God's holiness. In Jewish culture, uncleanness was associated with separation from God and community, as seen in Levitical laws (Leviticus 11-15). Jesus' command to the unclean spirit demonstrates His role as the one who purifies and restores. This act prefigures the ultimate victory over evil through His death and resurrection, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who commands the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

His word initiates the entire encounter, underscoring His sovereign authority over every realm (see <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16</a>).<p>- &#8220;Declared&#8221; points to more than casual speech; it is a royal edict. When Christ speaks, the result is certain (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>- Already&#8212;before the demon&#8217;s outburst, before the legion&#8217;s plea&#8212;Jesus had settled the matter. His prior command proves that spiritual conflict is never a clash of equals; it is the Creator effortlessly overruling the created (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Come out of this man</b><p>- The command is direct, only two words in English, yet bursting with compassion:<p>&#8226; It addresses the demon but centers God&#8217;s attention on the suffering man (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p>&#8226; It breaks bondage instantly; liberation does not require rituals or negotiations (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<p>- Cross references highlight the consistency of Jesus&#8217; liberating word: &#8220;Be silent and come out of him!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25</a>); &#8220;Come out of him now!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>); Paul mirrors this authority in <a href="/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>.<p>- The phrase reminds us that deliverance is personal. Jesus is not merely expelling evil; He is reclaiming a person created in God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), restoring him to wholeness (<a href="/mark/5-15.htm">Mark 5:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you unclean spirit!</b><p>- Jesus identifies the intruder. Evil is exposed, named, and commanded to depart (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11-13</a>).<p>- &#8220;Unclean&#8221; contrasts sharply with the holiness of Christ and foreshadows how His blood would make believers clean forever (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p>- By singling out the spirit, Jesus shows there is no ambiguity: the oppression is demonic, not psychological misunderstanding. Scripture consistently distinguishes between ordinary illness and demonic influence (<a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40-41</a>).<p>- The exclamation mark faithfully reflects the urgency and authority in His voice (<a href="/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>; <a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a> sets forth the supremacy of Jesus&#8217; spoken word: He initiates deliverance, commands immediate freedom, and exposes evil for what it is. The verse assures believers that Christ&#8217;s authority is absolute, His compassion personal, and His victory certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">For he said unto him.</span>--The Greek verb is in the imperfect tense, <span class= "ital">he was saying,</span> as though the demoniac had interrupted our Lord even while the words were in the act of being uttered.<p><span class= "bld">Thou unclean spirit.</span>--It is noticeable that our Lord first speaks as if the men were oppressed by a single demon only, and that it is in the answer of the man himself that we learn that their name was Legion. (On the man's use of the word "Legion," see Note on <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm" title="And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?">Matthew 8:29</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he said unto him, Come forth, thou unclean spirit, out of the man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for he was saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>). The unclean spirit endeavored to arrest, before it was spoken, that word of power which he knew he must obey. So in what follows, <span class="cmt_word">He was asking him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">What is thy name?</span> Why does our Lord ask this question? Clearly to elicit from him an answer that would reveal the multitude of the evil spirits, and so make his own power over them to be fully known. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto him, My name is Legion; for we are many</span>. The Roman legion consisted of six thousand soldiers. But the word is here used indefinitely for a large number. St. Luke so explains it where he says (<a href="/luke/8-30.htm">Luke 8:30</a>), "And he said, Legion: for many devils were entered into him." This revelation is doubtless designed to teach us how great is the number as well as the malignity of the evil spirits. If one human being can be possessed by so many, how vast must be the host of those who are permitted to have access to the souls of men, and if possible lead them to destruction! Satan here imitates him who is "The Lord of hosts." He too marshals his hosts, that he may fight against God and his people. But "for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
