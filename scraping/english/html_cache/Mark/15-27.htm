The crucifixion of Jesus with criminals fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, which states that the Messiah would be "numbered with the transgressors." This highlights the humility and suffering of Jesus, who, though innocent, was treated as a criminal.<p><b>they crucified</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, such as slaves, rebels, and those guilty of heinous crimes. It was designed to be a public, humiliating, and painful death. The act of crucifixion itself is significant in Christian theology, as it represents the atoning sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of humanity.<p><b>two robbers</b><br>The term "robbers" suggests that these individuals were more than just petty thieves; they were likely insurrectionists or bandits, possibly associated with Barabbas, who was released instead of Jesus (<a href="/mark/15-7.htm">Mark 15:7</a>). This further emphasizes the injustice of Jesus' crucifixion, as He was executed alongside those guilty of serious crimes.<p><b>one on His right and one on His left</b><br>The positioning of the robbers, one on each side of Jesus, symbolizes the separation of humanity in response to Christ. This scene is reminiscent of the parable of the sheep and the goats in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, where the righteous and the unrighteous are separated to the right and left of the Son of Man. It also fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction in <a href="/mark/10-37.htm">Mark 10:37-40</a>, where He speaks of those who will be on His right and left in His glory, though here it is in the context of His suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being crucified for the sins of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_robbers.htm">Two Robbers</a></b><br>Criminals crucified alongside Jesus, representing humanity's sinfulness and the fulfillment of prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of the crucifixion, also known as "The Place of the Skull," located outside Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The executors of the crucifixion, representing the authority of the Roman Empire.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cross.htm">The Cross</a></b><br>The instrument of execution, symbolizing both suffering and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' crucifixion between two robbers fulfills Old Testament prophecies, affirming the divine plan and sovereignty of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identification_with_sinners.htm">Identification with Sinners</a></b><br>Jesus' position between the robbers symbolizes His identification with sinners, offering redemption to all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_sin_and_redemption.htm">The Reality of Sin and Redemption</a></b><br>The presence of the robbers highlights the reality of sin and the need for redemption, which is available through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_choice_of_response.htm">The Choice of Response</a></b><br>The differing responses of the two robbers to Jesus illustrate the choice each person has in responding to Christ's offer of salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>The repentant robber's interaction with Jesus demonstrates the power of repentance and faith, even in the final moments of life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_15_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 15:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_27_OT_prophecy_fulfilled.htm">How does Mark 15:27 illustrate the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_two_rebels_in_Jesus_crucifixion.htm">What significance do the two "rebels" have in understanding Jesus' crucifixion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_27_Jesus_innocence_insight.htm">How does Mark 15:27 deepen our understanding of Jesus' innocence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_relate_to_rebels_daily.htm">In what ways can we identify with the "rebels" in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_27_Inspire_salvation_sharing.htm">How can Mark 15:27 inspire us to share the message of salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_crucify_two_with_Jesus_in_Mark_15_27.htm">Why were two criminals crucified alongside Jesus in Mark 15:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_two_criminals_in_Mark_15_27.htm">What significance do the two criminals hold in Mark 15:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_15_27_fulfill_prophecy.htm">How does Mark 15:27 fulfill Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_the_thief_beside_jesus.htm">Who was the thief on the cross beside Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_isaiah_53_9's_grave_claim.htm">Isaiah 53:9 claims the servant is assigned a grave with the wicked but ends up with the rich&#8212;where is the historical or archeological evidence to support this detail? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_mark_15_align_with_other_gospels.htm">How do the events described in Mark 15 align with differing crucifixion accounts in the other Gospels? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_language_did_jesus_speak_on_the_cross.htm">When Jesus said My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken Me ? in what language did he speak?

We know from St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-40.htm">Luke 23:40</a>) that one of these malefactors was saved; while it would appear that the other died in his sins. And thus Christ upon his cross, between these two men, and with the title of King over his head, presented a striking and awful picture of the final judgment. Such is the view of St. Ambrose on St. <a href="/luke/22.htm">Luke 22</a>, and of St. Augustine, who says," This cross, if you mark it well, was a judgment-seat. For the Judge being placed in the midst, the one who believed was set free; the other who reviled him was condemned; and thus he signified what he will do with the quick and the dead. Some he will place on his right hand, and some on his left" (Augustine, Tract. 31 in S.
