However, the event Jesus refers to actually occurred during the time of Ahimelech, Abiathar's father. This discrepancy may be due to Abiathar's more prominent role later in David's reign. Abiathar's priesthood represents a time of transition and turmoil in Israel's history, reflecting the challenges faced by David and his followers.<p><b>he entered the house of God</b><br>The "house of God" refers to the tabernacle at Nob, where the priests served and where the sacred bread was kept. This location was central to Israelite worship before the construction of Solomon's Temple. The tabernacle was a place of divine presence and worship, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>and ate the consecrated bread</b><br>The consecrated bread, also known as the "bread of the Presence," was placed on a table in the tabernacle as an offering to God. According to Levitical law, this bread was to be eaten only by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). David's act of eating the bread highlights the tension between legalistic adherence to the law and the necessity of mercy and human need.<p><b>which was lawful only for the priests</b><br>This phrase underscores the strict regulations surrounding the consecrated bread, emphasizing the holiness and separation of priestly duties. The law was clear that only priests could consume this bread, reflecting the sacred nature of their service and the importance of maintaining ritual purity.<p><b>And he gave some to his companions as well.</b><br>David's sharing of the bread with his companions illustrates the principle of mercy over sacrifice, a theme Jesus emphasizes in His ministry. This act prefigures the communal aspect of Jesus' mission, where He provides for His followers and breaks down barriers of ritual exclusivity. It also foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus shares bread with His disciples, symbolizing the new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abiathar.htm">Abiathar</a></b><br>Although the text mentions Abiathar, the event actually occurred during the high priesthood of Ahimelech, Abiathar's father.

Abiathar is later noted as the sole survivor of Saul&#8217;s slaughter of the priests (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20-23</a>). Mentioning him places the story in the era when David was on the run yet already anointed king. By pointing to that moment, Jesus reminds His listeners that God&#8217;s purposes for His anointed override ceremonial tradition when human need is pressing (compare <a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he entered the house of God</b><p>David&#8217;s approach to the sanctuary shows reverence for God even while fleeing. The &#8220;house of God&#8221; was the tabernacle at Nob, served by priests descended from Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>). Jesus uses this to underscore that God&#8217;s dwelling is a place of mercy for those who seek Him, not merely a museum of regulations (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4-5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ate the consecrated bread, which was lawful only for the priests</b><p>The Bread of the Presence was set before the LORD continually (<a href="/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>) and, by statute, reserved for Aaron&#8217;s sons (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). Yet Ahimelech (the priest serving before Abiathar took office) gave the bread to David because David&#8217;s hunger was immediate and genuine. Jesus highlights this to show that the law was never meant to negate compassion (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law is perfect, but it is applied within God&#8217;s larger purposes.<p>&#8226; Ceremonial commands yield to the preservation of life, illustrating the heart behind the law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he gave some to his companions as well</b><p>David&#8217;s companions, like David, were fugitives and hungry (<a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>). Sharing the bread demonstrates the communal nature of God&#8217;s provision and the leader&#8217;s responsibility to care for his people (<a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>). Jesus points out that David did not hoard God&#8217;s mercy; he distributed it. By analogy, the Son of Man, Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>), gives life-sustaining grace to all who follow Him (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a> affirms that God&#8217;s law, while unchanging, is always administered with mercy. David&#8217;s reception of the sacred bread shows that human need can legitimately supersede ceremonial restriction, foreshadowing Jesus&#8217; authority to interpret and fulfill the law. The passage reassures believers that God&#8217;s house welcomes the hungry, that His ordinances protect life rather than burden it, and that Christ, greater than David, supplies sustaining grace to every companion who walks with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">In the days of Abiathar the high priest.</span>--St. Mark's is the only record that gives the name of the high priest, and in so doing it creates an historical difficulty. In <a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said to him, Why are you alone, and no man with you?">1Samuel 21:1</a>, Ahimelech is named as exercising the high priest's office in the Tabernacle at Nob. He is slain by Doeg, at the command of Saul, and his son Abiathar joins David at the cave of Adullam (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm" title="And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.">1Samuel 22:20</a>), and continues to act as high priest till his deposition by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm" title="And to Abiathar the priest said the king, Get you to Anathoth, to your own fields; for you are worthy of death: but I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.">1Kings 2:26</a>). Two conjectural explanations suggest themselves as probable: (1) that St. Mark, or that our Lord, may have given the name of the more famous priest of the two, who, though not then high-priest, was at the Tabernacle at the time referred to; (2) that he might have acted then as a coadjutor to his father, as Eli's sons seem to have done to him (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm" title="So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwells between the cherubim: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.">1Samuel 4:4</a>), and being, as his flight showed, of David's party, was the chief agent in allowing him to take the shew-bread.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">During</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(epi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1909.htm">Strong's 1909: </a> </span><span class="str2">On, to, against, on the basis of, at. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the high priesthood</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#953;&#949;&#961;&#941;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(archiere&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_749.htm">Strong's 749: </a> </span><span class="str2">High priest, chief priest.
