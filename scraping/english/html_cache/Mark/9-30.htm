It was a diverse area with a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations, which reflects the inclusive nature of Jesus' message.

This passage through Galilee marks a shift from public ministry to more private instruction with His disciples.<p><b>But Jesus did not want anyone to know</b><br>This indicates Jesus' desire for privacy and focus on teaching His disciples. It reflects the "Messianic Secret," a theme in the Gospels where Jesus often instructs others not to reveal His identity or miracles. This secrecy allowed Him to control the timing and nature of His revelation as the Messiah.
