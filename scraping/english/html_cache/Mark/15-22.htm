Golgotha, also known as Calvary in Latin, is traditionally identified as a hill outside the walls of Jerusalem. The act of bringing Jesus here fulfills the Roman practice of executing criminals outside the city limits, as prescribed in Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>). The location is significant as it aligns with the typology of the scapegoat in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, which was sent outside the camp, symbolizing the removal of sin. The journey to Golgotha also reflects the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:33-34).<p><b>which means The Place of the Skull</b><br>The name "Golgotha" is Aramaic, and its translation as "The Place of the Skull" has led to various interpretations. Some suggest the site resembled a skull in shape, while others propose it was a place of execution where skulls were found. Theologically, the skull can symbolize death, and thus Golgotha becomes the place where Jesus conquers death through His crucifixion. This location is also significant in the context of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the prophecy of the Messiah crushing the serpent's head is seen as being fulfilled through Jesus' victory over sin and death at Golgotha.

It seems as though, when they had reached the gate of the city, they saw symptoms that our Lord was fainting under his burden; and so they pressed Simon into the service, that he might be ready to assist. At first our Lord carried his own cross. Tradition says (Cornelius a Lapide) that the cross was fifteen feet long, the transverse limb being eight feet; and that he so carried it that the upper portion rested on his shoulder, while the foot of the cross trailed on the ground. When they saw that he was breaking down under the weight of the cross, they laid it on Simon, that they might the more quickly reach the place of crucifixion<span class="cmt_word">. The place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</span> "Golgotha" is a Hebrew, or rather Chaldaic, word, applied to the skull on account of its roundness, that being the idea which lies in the root of the word. The Greek equivalent to the word is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; and this is rendered in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Calvaria</span>, a skull, from <span class="accented">calva</span>, bald. St. Luke is the only evangelist in whose Gospel (<a href="/luke/23-33.htm">Luke 23:33</a>) this word is rendered "Calvary." In the Revised Version it is rendered "the skull" The place was so called, either from its having been the spot where executions ordinarily took place (though in this case we might have expected to find it called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); or, more probably, it was derived from the configuration of the place itself, perhaps a round-like mound, or knoll, sufficiently elevated to be seen at a little distance and by a large number. As to the actual site of Golgotha, recent researches seem to have done much to confirm the ancient tradition. The Bordeaux pilgrim, A.D. 333, says, "On the left side of the original Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the hillock (<span class="accented">monticulus</span>) Golgotha, where the Lord was crucified. Hence, about a stone's throw distant, is the crypt where his body was deposited." St. Cyril of Jerusalem alludes to the spot frequently, and there was no doubt about it in the time of Eusebius, A.D. 315. Professor Willis says that the rock of Calvary still stands up, some fifteen feet above the pavement. "It appears likely," he says, "that in its original state this rock was part of a little swell of the ground that jutted out from the slope of Sepulchre Street, and probably always formed a somewhat abrupt view on the west and south sides" (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on St. Matthew). Captain Conder (<span class="accented">Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, <span class="accented">Quarterly Statement</span> July, 1882) thinks that he shall be able to show that the traditional Golgotha is the site of the original temple of Ashtoreth, and that this temple was the Jebusite sanctuary before David took Jerusalem, and round which the sepulchres of the kings were hewn after the worship of Jehovah had consecrated the temple hill. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They brought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(pherousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5342.htm">Strong's 5342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To carry, bear, bring; I conduct, lead; perhaps: I make publicly known.
