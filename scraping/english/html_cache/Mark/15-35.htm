The scene is set at Golgotha, a site outside Jerusalem's walls, where Roman executions were carried out. The crowd likely included Roman soldiers, Jewish leaders, and passersby. The presence of various groups highlights the public nature of crucifixions, intended as a deterrent. The bystanders' reaction is significant, as it reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' words, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" (My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), which He cried out in Aramaic. This misunderstanding underscores the spiritual blindness and confusion surrounding Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>they said, &#8220;Behold, He is calling Elijah.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of Elijah is rooted in Jewish eschatological expectations. Elijah, a prophet who did not die but was taken to heaven (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), was believed to return before the coming of the Messiah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>). The bystanders' statement reflects a common belief that Elijah would come to rescue the righteous in times of distress. This misunderstanding of Jesus' cry is ironic, as it points to the people's hope for deliverance while they fail to recognize Jesus as the true Messiah.
