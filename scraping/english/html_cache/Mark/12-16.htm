The denarius was a Roman coin commonly used during the time of Jesus, typically made of silver. It was the standard daily wage for a laborer. The act of bringing the coin highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish autonomy, as the coin itself was a symbol of Roman occupation and control over Judea.<p><b>and He asked them</b><br>Jesus often used questions to teach and reveal deeper truths. By asking questions, He engaged His listeners, prompting them to think critically about their beliefs and actions. This method was a common rabbinical technique used to provoke thought and discussion.<p><b>Whose image is this?</b><br>The image on the coin was that of the Roman Emperor, which in this context would have been Tiberius Caesar. The use of the word "image" is significant, as it echoes the concept of humans being made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). This sets up a contrast between earthly authority and divine authority, inviting reflection on where ultimate allegiance should lie.<p><b>And whose inscription?</b><br>The inscription on the denarius would have declared the divinity and authority of Caesar, often including titles such as "son of the divine Augustus." This highlights the blasphemous claims of the Roman emperors, who were often deified and worshipped. The question of inscription further emphasizes the tension between the worship of God and the idolatrous claims of earthly rulers.<p><b>Caesar&#8217;s, they answered</b><br>The response acknowledges the political reality of Roman rule over Judea. By admitting that the coin belongs to Caesar, the Pharisees and Herodians inadvertently affirm the legitimacy of Roman authority in civil matters. This sets the stage for Jesus' teaching on the relationship between civic duty and spiritual devotion, as He later instructs to "render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's" (<a href="/mark/12-17.htm">Mark 12:17</a>).
