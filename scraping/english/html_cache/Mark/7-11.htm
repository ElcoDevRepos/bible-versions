Jesus often challenged the religious leaders for prioritizing human traditions over God's commandments. This sets the stage for a critique of their practices.<p><b>that if a man says to his father or mother</b><br>The reference to "father or mother" highlights the commandment to honor one's parents, which is deeply rooted in Jewish law (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This commandment was not only a moral obligation but also a social one, ensuring the care of parents in their old age.<p><b>&#8216;Whatever you would have received from me is Corban&#8217;</b><br>The term "Corban" refers to something dedicated to God, making it unavailable for any other use. This practice allowed individuals to declare their possessions as devoted to God, thus exempting them from using those resources to support their parents. This reflects a misuse of religious vows to evade familial responsibilities.<p><b>(that is, a gift devoted to God)</b><br>This parenthetical explanation clarifies the meaning of "Corban" for readers unfamiliar with Jewish customs. The practice of dedicating gifts to God was legitimate, but in this context, it was being manipulated to circumvent the commandment to honor one's parents. This critique aligns with Jesus' broader message against hypocrisy and legalism, as seen in other passages like <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is teaching and addressing the Pharisees and scribes in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders who are often depicted as opposing Jesus and His teachings.

It had come to be applied specifically (as in the Greek of <a href="/matthew/27-6.htm" title="And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.">Matthew 27:6</a>; Jos. <span class= "ital">Wars,</span> ii. 9, ? 4) to the sacred treasure of the Temple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God</span> - these words, "that is to say, Given to God," are St. Mark's explanation of "corban" <span class="cmt_word">- ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered</span>. Now, this the scribes and Pharisees did for their own covetous ends. For most of them were priests, who received offerings made to God as his ministers, and then converted them to their own uses. In this they greatly erred; because the obligation of piety by which children are bound to support their parents when they need it, is a part of the law of nature, to which every vow, every oblation, ought to yield. Thus, if any one had devoted his goods to God, and his father or his mother became needy, those goods ought to be given to his parents and not to the temple. The word "corban" is a Hebrew word, meaning "that which is brought near," "a gift or offering to God." Hence, figuratively, the place where these offerings were deposited was called the "corbanas," or, "sacred treasury" (see <a href="/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>). Hence to say of anything, "It is Corban," was to say that it had a prior and more sacred destination. And when it was something that a parent might need, to say, "It is Corban," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is already appropriated to another purpose, was simply to refuse his request and to deny him assistance, and so to break one of the first of the Divine commandments. Thus the son, by crying "Corban" to his needy parents, shut their mouths, by opposing to them a scruple of conscience, and suggesting to them a superstitious fear. It was as much as to say, "That which you ask of me is a sacred thing which I have devoted to God. Beware, therefore, lest you, by asking this of me, commit sacrilege by converting it to your own uses." Thus the parents would be silenced and alarmed, choosing rather to perish of hunger than to rob God. To such extremities did these covetous scribes and Pharisees drive their victims, compelling a son to abstain from any kind offices for his father or his mother. St. Ambrose says, "God does not seek a gift wrung out of the necessities of parents." <span class="accented">Making void</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">depriving it of its authority</span>, <span class="accented">annulling.</span> In <a href="/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> the same word is rendered "disannul." <span class="accented">By your traditions</span>; the traditions, that is, by which they taught children to say "Corban" to their parents.
