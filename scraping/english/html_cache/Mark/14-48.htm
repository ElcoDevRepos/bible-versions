This crowd likely includes Roman soldiers, temple guards, and possibly some of the chief priests and elders. The fact that Jesus speaks to them highlights His calm and authoritative presence even in the face of betrayal and arrest. This interaction fulfills His role as the Good Shepherd, who willingly lays down His life for His sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>Have you come out with swords and clubs</b><br>The mention of "swords and clubs" indicates the crowd's expectation of resistance or violence. This reflects the misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, as He consistently taught peace and non-violence (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>). The use of such weapons underscores the tension and fear surrounding Jesus' influence and the threat perceived by the religious leaders. It also contrasts with Jesus' earlier teachings about turning the other cheek (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>).<p><b>to arrest Me</b><br>The act of arresting Jesus marks the beginning of the fulfillment of His prediction about His suffering and death (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>). This arrest is a pivotal moment in the Passion narrative, leading to His crucifixion and resurrection. It also fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah being rejected and suffering (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-7</a>).<p><b>as you would an outlaw?</b><br>By comparing Himself to an outlaw, Jesus highlights the irony and injustice of the situation. He had been teaching openly in the temple courts, yet they come to arrest Him under the cover of night, as if He were a dangerous criminal. This reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Messiah is "numbered with the transgressors." Jesus' rhetorical question exposes the hypocrisy and fear of the religious leaders, who are acting out of self-preservation rather than justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being arrested.

Then follows that remarkable incident mentioned only by St. John (<a href="/john/18-4.htm">John 18:4-6</a>), "Jesus... went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, was standing with them. When therefore he said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground." The presence of Christ in his serene majesty overpowered them. There was something in his looks and manner, as he repeated these words," I am he," words often used before by him, that caused them to retreat backwards, and to prostrate themselves. It was no external force that produced this result. The Divine majesty flashed from his countenance and overawed them, at least for the moment. At all events, it was an emphatic evidence, both to his own disciples and to this crowd, that it was by his own will that he yielded himself up to them. Perhaps this incident fired the courage of St. Peter; and so, as they approached to take our Lord, he drew his sword and struck off the ear of Malchus. Then our Lord healed him. And then he turned to the multitude and said, "Are ye come out as against a robber, with swords and staves, to seize me?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
