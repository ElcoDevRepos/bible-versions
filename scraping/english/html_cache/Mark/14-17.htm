This timing is significant as it sets the stage for the Passover meal, which is traditionally eaten after sundown. The evening also symbolizes the approaching darkness of Jesus' impending betrayal and crucifixion. The setting of evening can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is led like a lamb to the slaughter, indicating the beginning of Jesus' passion.<p><b>Jesus arrived</b><br>Jesus' arrival signifies His deliberate and purposeful actions in fulfilling His mission. Despite knowing the events that would soon unfold, He willingly enters into this pivotal moment. This reflects His obedience to the Father&#8217;s will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, where Jesus humbles Himself and becomes obedient to death. His arrival also fulfills the role of the Passover Lamb, as He positions Himself to be the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins.<p><b>with the Twelve</b><br>The Twelve refers to Jesus' closest disciples, symbolizing the new Israel and the foundation of the Church. Their presence highlights the intimate relationship Jesus has with His followers and the importance of community in the Christian faith. This gathering fulfills the typology of the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating a new covenant community. The Twelve are also witnesses to the events of the Last Supper, which is a precursor to the establishment of the Eucharist, a central sacrament in Christian worship. Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, is present, foreshadowing his imminent betrayal, which fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is preparing for His impending crucifixion.

Scripture records that Jewish days began at sundown, so evening signaled the transition to the Passover meal itself (<a href="/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows God&#8217;s timetable unfolding precisely. Earlier, Jesus said, &#8220;My time is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-18.htm">Matthew 26:18</a>); now that time has arrived.<p>&#8226; Evening often marks decisive moments in the Gospels&#8212;&#8220;That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32</a>).

By showing up, He embraces the Father&#8217;s plan, demonstrating perfect obedience (<a href="/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;arrived&#8221; reminds us that Jesus is never late&#8212;He arrives to initiate the New Covenant meal that will interpret His coming sacrifice (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the Twelve</b><p>&#8226; Jesus is not alone; He is intentionally &#8220;with the Twelve,&#8221; the men He &#8220;appointed&#8230;to be with Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>).
