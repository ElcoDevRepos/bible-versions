The sending of another servant indicates God's persistent attempts to reach His people despite their previous rejections. This reflects God's patience and long-suffering nature, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where He repeatedly sent prophets to call Israel back to faithfulness (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>).<p><b>and they struck him over the head</b><br>The act of striking the servant over the head signifies a violent rejection and disrespect for the messenger. This mirrors the historical treatment of prophets in Israel, such as the persecution of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>) and the stoning of Zechariah (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>). The physical violence underscores the severity of Israel's rebellion against God's messengers.<p><b>and treated him shamefully</b><br>Treating the servant shamefully highlights the contempt and dishonor shown towards God's representatives. This behavior reflects the broader cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient Near East, where such treatment would be considered a grave insult. The shameful treatment of prophets is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus Himself is mocked and scorned (<a href="/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28-31</a>).

Peter later writes, &#8220;The Lord is patient toward you, not wanting anyone to perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), underscoring the landlord&#8217;s persistent initiatives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they struck him over the head</b><p>&#8226; Violence escalates. Where the first servant in verse 3 was merely beaten and sent away empty-handed, this second messenger suffers a blow &#8220;over the head.&#8221; Matthew&#8217;s parallel says, &#8220;they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-35.htm">Matthew 21:35</a>), showing a rising hostility.<p>&#8226; Such treatment fulfills Jesus&#8217; lament: &#8220;O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). From Elijah&#8217;s confrontation with Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>) to Zechariah slain in the temple courts (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20&#8211;22</a>), the pattern is tragically consistent.<p>&#8226; The physical blow hints at ignominy. Isaiah spoke of the Servant who would be &#8220;struck&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>), foreshadowing Christ Himself, the ultimate rejected Messenger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and treated him shamefully</b><p>&#8226; Beyond physical harm, there is humiliation&#8212;insults, contempt, disgrace. <a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36&#8211;37</a> recounts servants of God who &#8220;faced jeers and flogging&#8230;they were put to death by stoning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Shame is a heart-level rejection; it says, &#8220;We will not listen.&#8221; Stephen summarizes Israel&#8217;s response: &#8220;Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>).<p>&#8226; This dishonor anticipates the scorn heaped on Jesus: &#8220;They spat on Him, and took the staff and struck Him on the head&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>). By including shame in the parable, Jesus subtly predicts the mocking He Himself will endure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-4.htm">Mark 12:4</a> portrays God&#8217;s relentless covenant love&#8212;He keeps sending servants&#8212;set against humanity&#8217;s deep-seated rebellion that grows from dismissal to violence to open contempt.
