This veil was a significant barrier, symbolizing the separation between God and humanity due to sin.

The veil's existence underscored the holiness of God and the sinfulness of man.<p><b>was torn in two</b><br>The tearing of the veil signifies the removal of the barrier between God and humanity.

It emphasizes divine intervention, as no human could have torn the veil in this manner. This act demonstrates God's initiative in reconciling with humanity through the sacrifice of His Son.

The holy place would correspond to what we call the nave of the church, in which the priests were continually present; the holy of holies would correspond to our chancel choir - the holiest part of the building. This was always kept closed; nor might any one enter it but the high priest, and that only once in the year, on the day of expiation. The veil which was rent at our Lord's death was that which was placed before the holy of holies; it was called the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The outer veil was called <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It was the duty of the officiating priest, on the evening of the day of preparation, at the hour of evening prayer, which would correspond to the time of our Lord's death, to enter into the holy place, where he would of course be between the two curtains, or veils, the outer veil, or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the inner veil, or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> It would then be his business to roll back the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, or outer veil, thus exposing the holy place to the people, who would be in the. outer court. And then and there they would see, to their amazement, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the inner veil, rent asunder from the top to the bottom. These veils or curtains, according to Josephus, were each forty cubits in height and ten in breadth, of great substance, very massive, and richly embroidered with gold and purple. Now, this rending of the veil signified <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the whole of the Jewish dispensation, with its rites and ceremonies, was now unfolded by Christ; and that thenceforth the middle wall of partition was broken down, so that now, not the Jews only, but the Gentiles also might draw nigh by the blood of Christ. But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it further signified that the way to heaven was laid open by our Lord's death. "When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of death, thou didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers." The veil signified that heaven was closed to all, until Christ by his death rent this veil in twain, and laid open the way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
