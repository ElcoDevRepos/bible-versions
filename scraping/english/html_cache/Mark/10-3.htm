It reflects Jesus' method of engaging with the religious leaders by directing them back to the Scriptures, specifically the Mosaic Law. The reference to Moses is significant because Moses is a central figure in Jewish tradition, representing the Law given by God. This question challenges the Pharisees to consider the original intent and spirit of the Law rather than their interpretations or traditions. It also highlights the authority of Scripture in addressing moral and ethical issues.<p><b>He replied.</b><br>Jesus' response is direct and authoritative, emphasizing His role as a teacher and interpreter of the Law. By engaging the Pharisees in this manner, Jesus demonstrates His deep understanding of the Scriptures and His ability to reveal their true meaning. This interaction also sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the sanctity of marriage and God's original design for it, as He will later reference the creation account in Genesis. This approach underscores the importance of returning to the foundational truths of Scripture when addressing complex issues.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees' question about divorce.

How do you read it?&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The question calls for a precise answer, underscoring that divine revelation is clear and knowable (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;did&#8221; looks back to a definite historical act&#8212;God&#8217;s giving of the Law through Moses.<p>&#8226; It reminds the hearers that God&#8217;s commands are not evolving social opinions but fixed past realities (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; Jude 3).<p>&#8226; Jesus roots the discussion in what has already been authoritatively delivered (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses</b><p>&#8226; Naming Moses highlights the God-ordained mediator of the Law (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The Pharisees revered Moses; Jesus appeals to the very authority they claim to uphold (<a href="/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45&#8211;47</a>).<p>&#8226; This tactic exposes whether their allegiance is to Moses&#8217; writings or to man-made loopholes (<a href="/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Command</b><p>&#8226; The focus is a &#8220;command,&#8221; not a suggestion&#8212;God speaks with binding authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus shifts the debate from &#8220;What may we do?&#8221; to &#8220;What has God commanded?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrasing also anticipates His later statement, &#8220;Because of your hardness of heart he wrote this command for you&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-5.htm">Mark 10:5</a>), showing that divine commands may expose sin rather than endorse it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You?</b><p>&#8226; The pronoun makes the inquiry personal and accountable (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; It presses the Pharisees to own their interpretation: they cannot hide behind collective tradition.<p>&#8226; Scripture is always meant to confront the individual heart (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He replied</b><p>&#8226; Jesus answers their question with a question, modeling how Scripture itself is the decisive authority in any controversy (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>,7,10).<p>&#8226; By replying in this way, He demonstrates that true teaching guides people back to God&#8217;s Word rather than merely asserting human opinion (<a href="/isaiah/8-20.htm">Isaiah 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The exchange sets up His subsequent exposition of <a href="/bsb/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1&#8211;2</a>, affirming the original design for marriage (<a href="/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-3.htm">Mark 10:3</a> shows Jesus leading His challengers straight to Scripture. Each word of His question&#8212;What, Did, Moses, Command, You&#8212;underscores that God&#8217;s past, clear, authoritative commands confront every individual heart today. Christ&#8217;s reply models how believers should settle moral issues: by returning to the written Word, embracing its literal authority, and allowing it to expose both sin and the need for obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he answered and</span> said <span class="cmt_word">unto them, What did Moses command you?</span> They professed much reverence for Moses; he therefore appeals to their great lawgiver<span class="cmt_word">. And they said, Moses suffered to write</span> <span class="cmt_word">a bill of divorcement, and to put her away.</span> If we now turn to St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). He we shall find that our Lord then appeals to the original institution of marriage. "Have ye not read, that he which made them from the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the twain shall become one flesh? So that they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." He thus reminds them that marriage is a Divine institution; that as Adam and Eve were united by him in a union which was indissoluble, therefore he intended that the marriage bond should remain ever, so that the wife ought never to be separated from her husband, since she becomes by marriage a very part of her husband. To this purpose St. Augustine says ('City of God,' bk. 14:22). He "It was not of the spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme, and the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the mind and the sense of the body; but plainly of the matrimonial union, by which the sexes are mutually bound together, that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any cause to put away one's wife, answered as in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-4.htm">Matthew 21:4, 5</a>). It is certain, then, that from the first men were created as we see and know them to be now, of two sexes - male and female - and that they are called one, either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of the origin of the woman, who was created from out of the side of the man." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
