This amazement often signifies a recognition of divine power and authority, contrasting with the religious leaders' skepticism. The Greek word used here, "thambeo," indicates a profound astonishment, suggesting that the people were witnessing something unprecedented.<p><b>and began to ask one another, &#8220;What is this?</b><br>This question highlights the people's confusion and curiosity. It underscores the novelty of Jesus' actions and teachings compared to the traditional teachings of the scribes. The question also reflects a search for understanding and truth, a theme prevalent in the Gospels as people grapple with Jesus' identity and mission.<p><b>A new teaching with authority!</b><br>The term "new teaching" suggests a departure from the established religious instruction of the time. Unlike the scribes, who relied on tradition and the interpretations of previous rabbis, Jesus taught with inherent authority. This authority is rooted in His divine nature, as seen in other scriptures where Jesus claims unity with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>). His teaching fulfilled the prophecies of a coming prophet like Moses, who would speak God's words directly (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a>).<p><b>He commands even the unclean spirits,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Jesus' power over demonic forces, a significant aspect of His ministry. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, unclean spirits were associated with evil and impurity. Jesus' ability to command them demonstrates His authority over the spiritual realm, fulfilling prophecies of the Messiah's power to liberate captives (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p><b>and they obey Him!&#8221;</b><br>The obedience of the unclean spirits to Jesus' commands further confirms His divine authority. This obedience is immediate and complete, showcasing Jesus' superiority over all spiritual entities. It also prefigures the ultimate victory over evil that Jesus would achieve through His death and resurrection, as prophesied in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority through His teaching and command over unclean spirits.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The crowd present in the synagogue, witnessing Jesus' authority and expressing amazement at His power and teaching.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_spirits.htm">Unclean Spirits</a></b><br>Demonic entities that Jesus commands, showcasing His authority over the spiritual realm.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a place of Jewish worship and teaching where Jesus often taught and performed miracles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Jesus' authority is not just in His words but also in His actions.
