The offering of wine mixed with myrrh was a customary practice intended to act as a mild analgesic, dulling the pain of those being crucified. Myrrh, a resin used for anointing and embalming, was also a valuable commodity, symbolizing suffering and death. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink." The location, Golgotha, was outside the city walls of Jerusalem, a place of execution, emphasizing the shame and suffering Jesus endured. The offering of this mixture highlights the Roman practice of crucifixion, which was designed to be a prolonged and excruciating death.<p><b>but He did not take it</b><br>Jesus' refusal to drink the wine mixed with myrrh signifies His willingness to fully experience the suffering of the crucifixion without any numbing of the pain. This act demonstrates His obedience to the Father's will and His commitment to fully bear the sins of humanity. It reflects His conscious choice to endure the full extent of human suffering, aligning with His role as the Suffering Servant prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. By rejecting the drink, Jesus fulfills His mission with complete awareness and submission, highlighting His sacrificial love and the depth of His atonement for sin. This moment also connects to His earlier declaration in <a href="/mark/14-25.htm">Mark 14:25</a>, where He states He will not drink of the fruit of the vine until He drinks it anew in the kingdom of God, pointing to the future hope and redemption through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is being crucified in this passage.

The first occasion is that mentioned by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>), when they offered him wine mingled with gall. This was a kind of stupefying liquor, a strong narcotic, made of the sour wine of the country, mingled with bitter herbs, and mercifully administered to dull the sense of pain. This was offered before the actual crucifixion took place. It is to this first occasion that St. Mark here refers. The words in the original are (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "they were giving, they offered him." <span class="accented">But he received it not.</span> He would not seek alleviation of the agonies of the crucifixion by any drugged potion which might render him insensible. He would bear the full burden consciously. The second occasion on which drink was offered to him was after he had been some hours on his cross, and when the end was drawing near; and it was then given in answer to his exclamation, "I thirst." This drink does not appear to have been mingled with any stupefying drug; and we do not read that he refused it. St. Mark does not record this second occasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they offered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(edidoun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1325.htm">Strong's 1325: </a> </span><span class="str2">To offer, give; I put, place.
