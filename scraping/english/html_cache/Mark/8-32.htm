Here, He is direct about His impending suffering and death, a topic that was difficult for His disciples to understand. This frankness underscores the seriousness of His message and His desire for the disciples to grasp the reality of His mission. The Greek word used here implies boldness and clarity, indicating that Jesus wanted to ensure there was no misunderstanding about what was to come.<p><b>and Peter took Him aside</b><br>Peter's action of taking Jesus aside shows a level of intimacy and boldness in their relationship. It reflects Peter's impulsive nature and his role as a leader among the disciples. This private setting suggests Peter's concern and perhaps his desire to protect Jesus from the implications of His words. In the cultural context, it was not uncommon for a disciple to question a teacher, but Peter's action also indicates a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission. This moment highlights Peter's human tendency to resist difficult truths and his struggle to align with God's plan.<p><b>and began to rebuke Him</b><br>Peter's rebuke of Jesus is a significant moment, as it reveals his misunderstanding of the Messiah's role. In Jewish expectation, the Messiah was seen as a conquering king who would liberate Israel from Roman oppression, not one who would suffer and die. Peter's reaction is rooted in this expectation and his love for Jesus, as he cannot fathom the idea of Jesus' suffering. This rebuke also parallels Satan's temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where Jesus was tempted to avoid the path of suffering. Peter's rebuke, though well-intentioned, is a human attempt to divert Jesus from His divine mission. This moment foreshadows Peter's later denial of Jesus, highlighting the ongoing struggle between human understanding and divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is openly speaking about His impending suffering and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong devotion to Jesus.

Verse 32 notes He spoke this &#8220;quite frankly,&#8221; meaning no parable, no veiled language&#8212;just clear, literal prophecy.<p>- By speaking plainly, Jesus confirmed the certainty of Scripture&#8217;s promises (<a href="/bsb/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="/bsb/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>) and prepared the disciples to anchor their faith in those promises.<p>- Similar moments of open disclosure appear in <a href="/mark/9-31.htm">Mark 9:31</a> and <a href="/john/16-29.htm">John 16:29-30</a>, where the disciples acknowledge, &#8220;Now You are speaking plainly.&#8221;<p>- For us, His frankness underscores that the cross and resurrection are non-negotiable realities, not symbolic ideas (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peter took Him aside</b><p>- Peter&#8217;s action mirrors <a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>, where &#8220;Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, &#8216;Far be it from You, Lord!

So say St. Chrysostom and others. Peter would not have his own confession of Christ thus evacuated, as it were; nor does he think it possible that the Son of God could be slain. So he takes him apart, lest he should seem to reprove him in the presence of the other disciples; and then he says (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>), "Mercy on thee, Lord (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>): this shall never be unto thee." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He spoke</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#940;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(elalei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2980.htm">Strong's 2980: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of an otherwise obsolete verb; to talk, i.e. Utter words.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[this]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
