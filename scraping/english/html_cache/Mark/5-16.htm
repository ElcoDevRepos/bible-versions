In the context of <a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5</a>, these are likely the herdsmen who were tending the pigs. Eyewitness testimony is a critical element in the Gospels, providing credibility and authenticity to the accounts of Jesus' miracles. The presence of witnesses underscores the public nature of Jesus' ministry and the undeniable impact of His works.<p><b>described what had happened</b><br>The act of describing indicates a detailed recounting of events. This suggests that the witnesses were compelled to share the extraordinary nature of what they observed. In the cultural context of the time, oral tradition was a primary means of communication, and such testimonies would spread rapidly. This aligns with the biblical theme of bearing witness to God's power and glory, as seen in other scriptural accounts where witnesses play a crucial role in spreading the news of Jesus' works (e.g., <a href="/john/4-39.htm">John 4:39</a>).<p><b>to the demon-possessed man</b><br>The man in question was possessed by a legion of demons, indicating a severe spiritual affliction. This highlights Jesus' authority over the spiritual realm, a recurring theme in the Gospels. The deliverance of the man is a powerful demonstration of Jesus' compassion and power to restore individuals to wholeness. This event fulfills the messianic prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who will proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners.<p><b>and also to the pigs</b><br>The pigs, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned. This dramatic event serves as a visible sign of the demons' departure and the extent of their destructive power. The loss of the pigs also reflects the economic impact on the local community, which may have contributed to their fear and request for Jesus to leave the region. Theologically, this incident illustrates the cost of spiritual deliverance and the value of a human soul over material possessions, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a> about the worth of a soul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who performs the miracle of casting out demons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/demon-possessed_man.htm">Demon-Possessed Man</a></b><br>- A man tormented by a legion of demons, living among the tombs, and unable to be restrained by chains.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pigs.htm">The Pigs</a></b><br>- A herd of about two thousand pigs that the demons enter after being cast out of the man, subsequently rushing down a steep bank into the sea and drowning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gerasenes.htm">The Gerasenes</a></b><br>- The region where this event takes place, located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>- Those who observed the miracle and reported it to others, including the townspeople and those tending the pigs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His supreme authority over the spiritual realm, reminding us of His power to deliver us from any bondage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation.htm">Transformation</a></b><br>The radical change in the demon-possessed man illustrates the transformative power of Christ in a believer's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing.htm">Witnessing</a></b><br>The role of the witnesses in spreading the news of Jesus' miracle encourages us to share our testimonies of His work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_human_life.htm">Value of Human Life</a></b><br>The loss of the pigs highlights the value Jesus places on human life and spiritual well-being over material possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_faith.htm">Fear and Faith</a></b><br>The reaction of the townspeople, who were afraid and asked Jesus to leave, challenges us to respond to Jesus' power with faith rather than fear.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_5_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 5:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_5_16_Jesus_power_over_demons.htm">How does Mark 5:16 demonstrate the power of Jesus over evil spirits?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_Jesus_authority_in_Mark_5_16.htm">What can we learn about Jesus' authority from Mark 5:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_5_16_s_link_to_Gospel_miracles.htm">How does Mark 5:16 connect to other miracles in the Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_Jesus_power_4.htm">How should believers respond to witnessing Jesus' transformative power today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_5_16_inspire_testimony.htm">How can Mark 5:16 inspire us to share testimonies of Jesus' work?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_5_16_Jesus_authority_on_spirits.htm">How does Mark 5:16 challenge our understanding of Jesus' authority over evil spirits?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Mark_5_16_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Mark 5:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Mark_5_16_Jesus_miracle_power.htm">How does Mark 5:16 illustrate the power of Jesus' miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_did_jesus_let_demons_enter_pigs.htm">Why did Jesus permit demons to enter pigs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_are_demons_moved_to_pigs.htm">Mark 5:1-13: How can demons scientifically or historically be transferred from a possessed man into a herd of pigs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/were_women_told_about_jesus'_body.htm">Were the women informed about Jesus' body's fate?

It mirrors the visible fallout in <a href="/exodus/8-24.htm">Exodus 8:24</a> when judgment on Egypt&#8217;s idols affected their animals.<p>- The economic impact jolts the community, highlighting the cost of encountering Jesus, just as <a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a> records believers burning costly sorcery scrolls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Eyewitnesses faithfully relay a literal, stunning deliverance: Jesus liberates a tormented man and permits the expelled demons to destroy a herd of pigs. Their report spreads, confirming Christ&#8217;s lordship over evil spirits, demonstrating His power to restore the most broken, and confronting listeners with the inescapable reality that an encounter with the Son of God changes everything&#8212;sometimes at great earthly cost, always for eternal good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How it befell him that was pessessed with devils, and concerning the swine</span>. The loss of the swine. They could not get over that. They thought far more of the worldly loss than of the spiritual gain; <span class="cmt_word">and they began to beseech him to depart from their borders</span>. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/8-37.htm">Luke 8:37</a>) says that "they were taken (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) [literally, were <span class="accented">holden</span>] with great fear." This was the dominant feeling. They did not entreat him to depart out of humility, as though they felt themselves unworthy of his presence; but out of servile, slavish fear, lest his continued presence among them might bring upon them still greater losses. They saw that Jesus, a Jew according to the flesh, was holy, powerful, Divine. But they knew that they were Gentiles, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. Wherefore they feared lest he should punish them more grievously, both on account of their being Gentiles and on account of their past sins. It was not, therefore, so much on account of hatred, as out of a timorous fear, that they besought Jesus that he would depart out of their borders. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Those</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
