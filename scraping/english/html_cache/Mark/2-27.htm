In the context of <a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees, who were questioning His disciples' actions on the Sabbath. This declaration is part of a larger narrative where Jesus is redefining the understanding of the law and its purpose. Jesus often used such declarations to challenge prevailing interpretations and to reveal deeper spiritual truths.<p><b>The Sabbath was made for man</b><br>The Sabbath, instituted in <a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>, was a day of rest following God's creation work. It was given as a gift to humanity, a time for rest and spiritual renewal. In <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, the Sabbath is part of the Ten Commandments, underscoring its importance. The phrase highlights that the Sabbath was intended to benefit humanity, providing rest and a reminder of God's provision and care. It was not meant to be a burden but a blessing, reflecting God's compassion and understanding of human needs.<p><b>not man for the Sabbath</b><br>This part of the statement corrects the Pharisaic interpretation that had turned the Sabbath into a legalistic burden. By Jesus' time, numerous additional rules had been added to the Sabbath observance, making it a heavy yoke rather than a day of rest. Jesus is emphasizing that human needs and well-being are more important than strict adherence to man-made rules. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God desires mercy and compassion over sacrifice (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, <a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). Jesus, as Lord of the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>), has the authority to interpret its true purpose, pointing to His divine nature and mission to fulfill the law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the purpose of the Sabbath, emphasizing its role in serving humanity rather than being a burdensome obligation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often challenged Jesus, particularly regarding the observance of the Sabbath.

Jesus responds, and the word &#8220;declared&#8221; marks a public, authoritative pronouncement.<p>- This fits His pattern of speaking &#8220;as one who had authority&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>) and asserting lordship over the Sabbath moments later: &#8220;So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>).<p>- By beginning with a declaration, Jesus positions Himself&#8212;not tradition&#8212;as the reliable interpreter of God&#8217;s Law (cf. <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/luke/6-5.htm">Luke 6:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Sabbath was made for man</b><p>- &#8220;Was made&#8221; points back to creation week: &#8220;God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>). Before sin entered the world, rest was woven into human life.<p>- Sabbath is therefore a gracious gift.

Jesus&#8217; authoritative declaration rescues the day from legalistic distortion, reminding us that God&#8217;s commands promote life, rest, and freedom rather than bondage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - The sabbath was instituted for the benefit of man, that he might refresh and renew his body, fatigued and worn by six days' labour, with the restful calm of the seventh; and that he might have leisure to apply his mind to the things which concern his everlasting salvation; to consider and meditate upon the Law of God; and rouse himself, by the remembrance of the Divine greatness and goodness, to true repentance, to gratitude, and to love. The force of the argument is this: The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath. The sabbath, great and important as that institution is, is subordinate to man. If, then, the absolute rest of the sabbath becomes hurtful to man, a new departure must be taken, and some amount of labour must be undergone, that man may be benefited. Therefore was Christ justified in permitting to his disciples a little labour in plucking these ears of corn on the sabbath day, in order that they may appease their hunger. For it is better that the rest of the sabbath should be disturbed, though but a little, than that any one of those for whose sake the sabbath was instituted should perish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
