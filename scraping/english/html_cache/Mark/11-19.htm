In Jewish culture, the day begins at sunset, so evening marks the transition to a new day. This timing is significant as it reflects the rhythm of Jewish life and worship, where evening and morning are the markers of a day (<a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>). The evening also symbolizes a time of reflection and rest after the day's activities.<p><b>Jesus and His disciples</b><br>This highlights the close relationship between Jesus and His followers. The disciples are often depicted as learners and witnesses to Jesus' ministry. Their presence with Jesus during this time underscores their role in learning from His actions and teachings. The disciples' experiences with Jesus during these events would later be foundational for their own ministries and the spread of the Gospel.<p><b>went out of the city</b><br>The city referred to here is Jerusalem, a central location in Jewish religious life and the site of the temple. Jesus' departure from the city at evening could symbolize a temporary withdrawal from the center of religious and political tension. This action may also reflect a pattern in Jesus' ministry of retreating for rest and prayer, often in more secluded areas (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). Additionally, this movement out of the city can be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic actions, as Jesus often moved in and out of Jerusalem during the final week leading to His crucifixion, symbolizing His role as the suffering servant who would be rejected by the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles throughout His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem, a significant location in Jesus' ministry, especially during the events leading up to His crucifixion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time of day when Jesus and His disciples leave the city, indicating a transition in the account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_cleansing.htm">The Temple Cleansing (Contextual Event)</a></b><br>Earlier in <a href="/bsb/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>, Jesus cleanses the temple, which sets the stage for the tension between Him and the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest_and_retreat.htm">The Importance of Rest and Retreat</a></b><br>Jesus models the balance between active ministry and necessary rest.

So true it was that "he came unto his own, and his own received him not." No one in that city, which he loved so well, offered to receive him. The end was drawing near.
