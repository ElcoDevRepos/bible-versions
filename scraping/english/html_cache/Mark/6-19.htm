Herodias had previously been married to Herod's brother, Philip, which made her marriage to Herod both unlawful and scandalous according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16, 20</a>:21). John the Baptist openly condemned this union, which led to Herodias harboring deep resentment against him. This grudge reflects the broader theme of prophetic voices being opposed by those in power, as seen throughout the Old Testament with figures like Elijah and Jeremiah.<p><b>and wanted to kill him.</b><br>Herodias's desire to kill John the Baptist highlights the extreme measures she was willing to take to silence his prophetic voice. This mirrors the hostility faced by prophets who spoke against the moral and spiritual failings of their time. Herodias's actions can be seen as a fulfillment of the pattern of persecution against God's messengers, as Jesus later warned His disciples they would face similar opposition (<a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>).<p><b>But she had been unable,</b><br>Herodias's inability to kill John immediately was due to Herod's fear and respect for John, whom he recognized as a righteous and holy man (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>). This tension between Herodias's desire and Herod's reluctance underscores the conflict between political power and moral conviction. It also foreshadows the eventual martyrdom of John, paralleling the fate of Jesus, who was also executed despite the reluctance of the ruling authority, Pontius Pilate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herodias.htm">Herodias</a></b><br>The wife of Herod Antipas, who was previously married to his brother Philip.
