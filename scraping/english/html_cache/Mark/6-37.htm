This command highlights the disciples' role in Jesus' ministry, emphasizing their participation in His work. The phrase underscores the theme of faith and reliance on divine provision, as the disciples are faced with a seemingly impossible task. This moment foreshadows the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, illustrating Jesus as the provider, akin to God providing manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also points to Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), a type of spiritual sustenance.<p><b>They asked Him, &#8220;Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' question reflects their practical concerns and limited understanding of Jesus' power. A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer, so two hundred denarii represented a significant sum, highlighting the enormity of the task. This amount underscores the disciples' reliance on human resources rather than divine intervention. The question reveals their doubt and the challenge of faith when faced with logistical impossibilities. This moment connects to other instances where Jesus tests His followers' faith, such as when He calms the storm (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>) and when Peter walks on water (<a href="/matthew/14-28.htm">Matthew 14:28-31</a>).

The penny, or "denarius," was the chief Roman silver coin, worth about eight-pence halfpenny. Upon the breaking up of the Roman empire, the states which arose upon its ruins imitated the coinage of the old imperial mints, and in general called their principal silver coin the "denarius." Thus the denarius found its way into this country through the Anglo-Saxons, and it was for a long period the only coin. Hence the introduction of the word into the Authorized Version. Two hundred pennyworth would be of the value of nearly seven pounds.
