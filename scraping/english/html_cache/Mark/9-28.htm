Houses in first-century Palestine were often small and simple, providing a more intimate setting for discussion. This setting emphasizes the personal relationship between Jesus and His disciples, highlighting the importance of private instruction and reflection in spiritual growth.<p><b>His disciples asked Him privately</b><br>The disciples' approach to Jesus in private reflects their desire for understanding and growth. It shows their recognition of Jesus as a teacher and authority figure. This private inquiry suggests humility and a willingness to learn, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. It also underscores the disciples' struggle with faith and understanding, a common human experience.<p><b>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we drive it out?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals the disciples' confusion and frustration over their inability to cast out a demon, despite having been given authority to do so earlier (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>). It highlights the theme of faith and dependence on God, as well as the limitations of human ability without divine empowerment. This moment serves as a teaching opportunity for Jesus to address the necessity of prayer and faith, as seen in the subsequent verses. The question also connects to other scriptural instances where faith is tested and refined, such as in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a> and <a href="/luke/17-5.htm">Luke 17:5-6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who performed miracles and taught His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were learning from Him and were given authority to perform miracles in His name.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>A private setting where Jesus and His disciples could speak away from the crowds, indicating a place of intimacy and learning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirit.htm">The Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>The context of this verse involves a boy possessed by an unclean spirit, which the disciples were unable to cast out.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_private_inquiry.htm">The Private Inquiry</a></b><br>The disciples' question to Jesus in private shows their desire to understand and grow in their spiritual authority and effectiveness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faith.htm">The Importance of Faith</a></b><br>Faith is crucial in exercising spiritual authority.

Away from observers, they can examine motives and methods without posturing (<a href="/luke/8-9.htm">Luke 8:9</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene reminds believers that unanswered ministry moments should drive us toward Christ for clarification, not away from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we drive it out?&#8221;</b><p>&#8211; Their earlier success in casting out demons (<a href="/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>) may have led to self-reliance.

Moving indoors, they confront the gap between earlier victory and present failure. Their honest question sets the stage for Jesus to teach that effective ministry flows from continual, prayer-saturated dependence on Him. For every believer, the verse invites us to bring our &#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t we&#8230;?&#8221; moments to Christ, confident that He will supply both the answer and the power needed for faithful service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
