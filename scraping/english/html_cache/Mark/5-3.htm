Tombs were often caves or carved out of rock, located outside the city, symbolizing separation from the community and God. This reflects the spiritual and social isolation of the demon-possessed man. The presence of tombs also foreshadows the power of Jesus over death, as He later demonstrates through His resurrection.<p><b>and could no longer be restrained</b><br>The inability to restrain the man highlights the severity of his condition and the supernatural strength given by the demons. This detail underscores the power of evil and the desperate need for divine intervention. It also sets the stage for Jesus' authority over demonic forces, as seen in His ability to command them with a word (<a href="/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a>).<p><b>even with chains</b><br>Chains symbolize human attempts to control or manage evil through physical means, which are ultimately ineffective. This reflects the broader biblical theme that spiritual problems require spiritual solutions. The futility of chains points to the necessity of Christ's power to truly liberate and heal.
