The group likely included Jesus' disciples and possibly other followers or residents of Bethany. The setting is significant as Bethany was a place where Jesus often found refuge and support. The presence of "some" indicates that not all shared the same sentiment, highlighting a division in understanding and appreciation of the act that was about to be criticized.<p><b>however, expressed their indignation to one another</b><br>The indignation expressed here reflects a common human reaction to perceived wastefulness, especially in a culture where resources were scarce and poverty was prevalent. This reaction can be seen as a misunderstanding of the spiritual significance of the woman's act of anointing Jesus. The disciples, particularly Judas Iscariot as noted in other Gospel accounts, were concerned with practical matters, such as the financial implications of the act. This moment reveals a tension between earthly concerns and spiritual devotion.<p><b>&#8220;Why this waste of perfume?</b><br>The question posed underscores a lack of understanding of the symbolic act of anointing Jesus. The perfume, identified as costly nard, was a luxury item, often used for anointing the dead, which foreshadows Jesus' impending death and burial. The disciples' reaction contrasts with the woman's act of worship and devotion, which Jesus later commends. This moment invites reflection on the value of sacrificial giving and the recognition of Jesus' worth. The question also echoes themes of stewardship and the use of resources, which are addressed throughout Scripture, such as in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Messiah, and the Son of God, who is present at the event.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_alabaster_jar.htm">The Woman with the Alabaster Jar</a></b><br>- Although not named in this verse, she is identified in other Gospels as Mary of Bethany, who anoints Jesus with expensive perfume.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_others_present.htm">Disciples and Others Present</a></b><br>- Those who witnessed the anointing and expressed indignation at the perceived waste.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>- The village where this event takes place, located near Jerusalem, often a place of refuge for Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/alabaster_jar_of_perfume.htm">Alabaster Jar of Perfume</a></b><br>- A costly item used by the woman to anoint Jesus, symbolizing devotion and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_worship_and_sacrifice.htm">Value of Worship and Sacrifice</a></b><br>True worship often involves sacrifice and may not always be understood by others.
