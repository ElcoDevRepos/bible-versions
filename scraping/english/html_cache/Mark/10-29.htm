It is a common introductory formula in Jesus' teachings, underscoring His authority and the certainty of His words. This phrase is akin to the Hebrew "Amen," which means "so be it" or "truthfully."<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>This indicates a response to a preceding statement or question. In the context of <a href="/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a>, Jesus is responding to Peter, who has just remarked on the sacrifices the disciples have made to follow Him. This interaction highlights the personal and direct communication between Jesus and His disciples, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader.<p><b>&#8220;no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields</b><br>This list represents the significant sacrifices that followers of Jesus might make. In the first-century Jewish context, family and land were central to one's identity and security. Leaving these behind would be a profound act of devotion and trust in Jesus. The mention of "fields" also indicates economic sacrifice, as land was a primary source of livelihood.<p><b>for My sake and for the gospel</b><br>This phrase clarifies the motivation behind the sacrifices. It is not merely about leaving behind worldly attachments but doing so for the sake of Jesus and the proclamation of the gospel. This underscores the call to prioritize spiritual commitments over earthly ties. The gospel, meaning "good news," refers to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, a central theme in the New Testament. This call to sacrifice for the gospel echoes the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and the call to take up one's cross (<a href="/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples, teaching them about the cost and rewards of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are learning about the sacrifices required to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>Mentioned as those whom one might leave for the sake of following Jesus, representing personal and relational sacrifices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields.htm">Fields</a></b><br>Symbolic of material possessions and livelihood, indicating the potential economic sacrifices involved in discipleship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gospel.htm">The Gospel</a></b><br>The good news of Jesus Christ, for which believers are called to make sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may require significant personal and material sacrifices.

It may be that St. Matthew was guided to record it, inasmuch as his Gospel was written for Jews. Its omission by St. Mark and St. Luke may be explained by the fact that they were writing, the one to Romans, and the other to Gentiles generally. Omitting further notice here of this great promise recorded only by St. Matthew, St. Mark's words seem general, common to all faithful Christians. This leaving, of house, or <span class="cmt_word">brethren</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">sisters</span>, etc., might be rendered necessary from various causes.
