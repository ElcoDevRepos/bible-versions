This amazement is not one of admiration but of astonishment at their persistent unbelief despite the evidence of His teachings and miracles. The Greek word used here for "amazed" (&#952;&#945;&#965;&#956;&#940;&#950;&#969;) indicates a profound sense of wonder or surprise. This reaction highlights the human tendency to reject what is familiar, as Jesus Himself notes in <a href="/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own town." The unbelief of the Nazarenes serves as a stark contrast to the faith seen in other parts of the Gospel, such as the faith of the centurion in <a href="/matthew/8-10.htm">Matthew 8:10</a>, where Jesus is also amazed, but positively. This unbelief fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>And He went around from village to village, teaching the people.</b><br>Despite the rejection in Nazareth, Jesus continues His ministry undeterred, moving through the surrounding villages. This itinerant ministry is a hallmark of Jesus' approach, emphasizing the accessibility of His message to all, not just those in major cities or religious centers. The region of Galilee, where these villages are located, was a mix of Jewish and Gentile populations, reflecting the inclusive nature of Jesus' mission. His teaching often took place in synagogues, open fields, or homes, demonstrating the adaptability and reach of His message. This movement from village to village also prefigures the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to "go and make disciples of all nations." The act of teaching is central to Jesus' ministry, as seen throughout the Gospels, where He is often referred to as "Rabbi" or "Teacher," indicating His role in imparting divine wisdom and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God, who is both fully divine and fully human.
