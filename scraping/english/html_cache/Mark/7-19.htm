In this context, Jesus is emphasizing that external factors, such as food, do not defile a person spiritually. This teaching contrasts with the Pharisaic emphasis on ritual purity and external observance. The heart is the seat of moral and spiritual life, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding the heart above all else. Jesus is redirecting focus from external rituals to internal purity, aligning with the prophetic call for a heart-oriented faith found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>.<p><b>but it goes into the stomach</b><br>The stomach is part of the physical body, and Jesus is making a distinction between physical processes and spiritual realities. This statement underscores the temporary and physical nature of food consumption, which does not impact one's spiritual state. The emphasis here is on the natural digestive process, which is a common human experience, transcending cultural and religious boundaries. This teaching challenges the Jewish dietary laws that were a significant part of the Mosaic Covenant, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, by suggesting that they are not the ultimate measure of holiness.<p><b>and then is eliminated.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to the natural biological process of digestion and excretion, highlighting the transient nature of food. Jesus uses this imagery to illustrate that what enters the body physically does not affect one's spiritual condition. This teaching would have been radical to His Jewish audience, who adhered strictly to dietary laws. The process of elimination signifies the temporary impact of food, contrasting with the enduring nature of spiritual purity and defilement, which are matters of the heart and mind.<p><b>(Thus all foods are clean.)</b><br>This parenthetical statement is a theological conclusion drawn from Jesus' teaching, indicating a shift from the Old Covenant dietary restrictions to the New Covenant freedom. It prefigures the vision given to Peter in <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-16</a>, where God declares all foods clean, symbolizing the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith. This declaration aligns with the fulfillment of the Law through Christ, as He embodies the ultimate purity and holiness. The statement also reflects the early church's struggle with Jewish-Gentile relations and the move towards a unified body of believers, as seen in the Jerusalem Council's decision in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching about the nature of true defilement, emphasizing the importance of inner purity over external rituals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often challenged Jesus, particularly on matters of the law and tradition.

The "heart" is, after the common Hebrew idiom, the symbol of the mind as well as the affections. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/7-7.htm" title="And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-4.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-16.htm" title="Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,">Proverbs 9:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-13.htm" title="In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.">Proverbs 10:13</a>, in all of which "understanding" stands for the Hebrew of "heart.")<p><span class= "bld">Purging all meats.</span>--This also is peculiar to St. Mark, and presents some difficulties. In the commonly received text, the participle is in the neuter nominative, agreeing with the nominative to the verb "goeth out." But in this construction it is difficult to see in what sense that which goeth into the mouth--itself an article of food, with no special character--can be said to purge or cleanse all other forms of food. The better MSS., however, give the participle in the masculine. This has been explained by many as a grammatical anomaly, and the participle being treated as if it agreed (though in a different case) with the word "draught" or "cesspool," the latter is said to cleanse all meats, as removing the <span class= "ital">excreta,</span> or impure parts, from them, and leaving only that which nourishes the body. A far better construction, both as to grammar and meaning, is found by making the word "purging," or better, <span class= "ital">cleansing,</span> agree with the subject of the verb "He saith," in <a href="/mark/7-18.htm" title="And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also? Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without enters into the man, it cannot defile him;">Mark 7:18</a>--"He saith this . . . and in so saying, cleanseth all meats." So taken, the words anticipate, in almost the same terms, the truth of <a href="/acts/10-15.htm" title="And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not you common.">Acts 10:15</a>, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common." The construction is tenable grammatically, has the support of high authority both ancient and modern, and obviously gives a much better sense. It is a possible conjecture that the words "cleansing all meats" may have been, at first, a marginal note (like the addition in <a href="/mark/7-16.htm" title="If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.">Mark 7:16</a>), attached to "He saith," and have afterwards found their way into the text. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it does not enter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#973;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(eisporeuetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1531.htm">Strong's 1531: </a> </span><span class="str2">To journey in(to), I go in(to), enter, intervene.
