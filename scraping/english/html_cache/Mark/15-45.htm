His confirmation with the centurion, a Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers, underscores the Roman authority over the events. The centurion's role was significant as he was responsible for overseeing the execution and ensuring Jesus was dead. This confirmation was necessary to prevent any claims that Jesus had survived, which could have led to unrest. The centurion's testimony is consistent with Roman military discipline and the importance of verifying death in executions. This moment also fulfills the prophecy of Jesus' death, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which speaks of His grave being with the wicked and the rich in His death.<p><b>he granted the body to Joseph</b><br>Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Jewish council, boldly requested Jesus' body. This act required courage, as associating with a crucified man could lead to social and religious repercussions. Joseph's request fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, where it is foretold that the Messiah would be with a rich man in His death. Joseph's actions also highlight the fulfillment of the Jewish burial customs, which required prompt burial before the Sabbath. His involvement signifies the transition from Jesus' humiliation to His honor in burial, as Joseph provided a new tomb for Jesus, aligning with the customs of the time and showing reverence for the deceased.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.
