It is important to note that Jesus often used such direct statements to convey significant truths or prophecies. The context here is a continuation of His teachings and revelations to His closest followers, emphasizing the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>&#8220;Truly I tell you,</b><br>The use of "Truly" (often translated as "Verily" or "Amen") underscores the certainty and importance of what Jesus is about to say. It is a solemn affirmation, indicating that the statement is of great significance and should be received with full assurance of its truth.<p><b>there are some standing here</b><br>This phrase suggests that the prophecy or promise Jesus is about to make is directed to a specific group of His immediate audience. It implies that not all, but some of those present will experience what He is about to describe. This has led to various interpretations about who these individuals might be and what event they would witness.<p><b>who will not taste death</b><br>"Taste death" is a metaphorical expression for experiencing death. The phrase suggests that some of Jesus' listeners would remain alive to witness a significant event. This has been interpreted in various ways, including the Transfiguration, the resurrection, the ascension, or the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.<p><b>before they see the kingdom of God</b><br>The "kingdom of God" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His redemptive purposes. This phrase indicates that the event to be witnessed is a manifestation of God's kingdom. It connects to other scriptural references where Jesus speaks of the kingdom being near or present (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<p><b>arrive with power.&#8221;</b><br>The arrival "with power" suggests a visible and transformative event, demonstrating God's authority and might. This could refer to the Transfiguration (<a href="/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2-8</a>), where Jesus' divine glory is revealed, or to the events of Pentecost (Acts 2), where the Holy Spirit empowers the apostles.

The verse ought to come, as in St. Matthew and St. Luke, in immediate connection with the foregoing discourse. The present arrangement may have been made with a view of connecting it with the Transfiguration, as that which was the fulfilment of the promise; but if so, it was based on what is at least a doubtful interpretation. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>.) The form of the words in St. Mark agrees with St. Luke's report, "until they shall see the kingdom of God," rather than with St. Matthew's "the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."<p><span class= "bld">Come with power.</span>--The Greek verb implies that they should see it not "coming," but as having actually come in its completeness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Till they see the kingdom of God come with power. In St. <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a> the words run thus: "Till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom." In St. <a href="/luke/9-27.htm">Luke 9:27</a>, "Till they see the kingdom of God." All these evangelists connect their record of the Transfiguration with these predictive words - a circumstance which must not be lost sight of in their interpretation. The question, therefore, is whether or how far the Transfiguration is to be regarded as a fulfillment of these words. One thing seems plain, that the Transfiguration, if a fulfillment at all, was not an exhaustive fulfillment of the words. The solemnity of their introduction forbids us to limit them to an event which would happen within eight days of their utterance. But there was an event impending, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, involving the overthrow of the Jewish polity, which, coming as it did within forty or fifty years of the time when our Lord uttered these words, might reasonably have been expected to take place within the lifetime of some of those then standing there. And that great catastrophe was frequently alluded to by our Lord as a type and earnest of the great judgment at the end of the world. What relation, then, did the Transfiguration hold to these two events and to the prediction contained in this verse? It was surely a prelude and pledge of what should be hereafter, specially designed to brace and strengthen the apostles for the sight of the sufferings of their Master, and to animate them to endure the toil and the trials of the Christian life. So that the Transfiguration was an event, so to speak, parenthetic to this prediction - a preliminary manifestation, for the special advantage of those who witnessed it; though given also "for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come." Such were the views of St. Hilary, St. Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, and others. "When our Lord was transfigured," says St. Jerome, "he did not lose his form and aspect, but he appeared to his apostles as he will appear at the day of judgment." And elsewhere he says, "Go forth a little out of your prison, and place before your eyes the reward of your present labor, Which 'the eye hath not seen, nor the ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
