In the context of <a href="/mark/3.htm">Mark 3</a>, Jesus is responding to accusations from the scribes that He is casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul, another name for Satan. The idea of division within Satan's realm is used to illustrate the absurdity of their claim. Biblically, division is often seen as a sign of weakness and impending downfall, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/12-25.htm">Matthew 12:25</a> and <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a>, where Jesus speaks of a house divided against itself not being able to stand.<p><b>and rises against himself</b><br>The imagery of Satan rising against himself further emphasizes the self-destructive nature of division. Historically, the concept of a kingdom or entity rising against itself would be understood as a precursor to collapse. This phrase also highlights the impossibility of Satan working against his own interests, which would be contrary to his nature as the adversary. Theologically, it underscores the unity and singular purpose of evil, contrasting with the unity and purpose found in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>he cannot stand</b><br>This statement is a logical conclusion drawn from the previous phrases. If Satan's kingdom is divided, it cannot maintain its power or influence. The inability to stand is a metaphor for inevitable defeat. This reflects the biblical principle that unity is essential for strength and endurance, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>, where a cord of three strands is not easily broken. It also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of Satan, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>.<p><b>his end has come</b><br>The phrase "his end has come" signifies the ultimate downfall and destruction of Satan's power. In the broader biblical narrative, this points to the eschatological promise of Satan's defeat and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This is consistent with prophecies found in <a href="/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26-27</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where the end of evil is assured. Theologically, it reassures believers of the temporary nature of Satan's influence and the certainty of God's victory through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is addressing the accusations from the scribes that He is casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>Referred to in this verse as the adversary, representing the kingdom of darkness.

If even human governments collapse under internal conflict, how much more would Satan&#8217;s domain crumble should he begin to war with his own forces? This observation affirms Jesus&#8217; earlier claim that He casts out demons &#8220;by the Spirit of God&#8221; rather than by demonic power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rises against himself</b><p>The picture intensifies: not only is there division, but Satan is actively turning on his own agenda. Scripture elsewhere shows Satan as single-minded in opposition to God (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). A self-inflicted insurrection would contradict everything we know of his character and strategy. Jesus&#8217; logic exposes the absurdity of His critics&#8217; accusation that He performs miracles by Satan&#8217;s power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he cannot stand</b><p>A divided, self-opposing kingdom collapses. Paul uses similar imagery when describing spiritual warfare: believers are called to &#8220;stand firm&#8221; against the devil&#8217;s schemes (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). If steadfast unity is required to stand, the opposite&#8212;division&#8212;guarantees defeat. Satan&#8217;s defeat is not hypothetical; Christ&#8217;s ministry on earth already demonstrates authority over him (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his end has come</b><p>Because Jesus decisively casts out demons, He signals Satan&#8217;s impending doom. This aligns with <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where the devil is ultimately thrown into the lake of fire, and with <a href="/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>, which promises that &#8220;the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;has come&#8221; underscores the certainty of that future: Christ&#8217;s victory is present and ongoing, moving creation toward the final judgment when Satan&#8217;s power will be utterly extinguished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>By pointing out the impossibility of Satan fighting himself, Jesus refutes the charge that His deliverance ministry is demonic. A kingdom divided is doomed; therefore, Satan&#8217;s consistent hatred of God rules out any suggestion that Jesus works by demonic power. Instead, every exorcism proclaims Christ&#8217;s superiority and previews Satan&#8217;s inevitable, foretold end.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
