Baptism in Jewish tradition was a ritual of purification and repentance, but Jesus, being sinless, participated to fulfill all righteousness and to identify with humanity. The Jordan River holds significant historical and spiritual importance, being the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). This act symbolizes a new beginning and the inauguration of Jesus' public ministry.<p><b>He saw the heavens breaking open</b><br>The opening of the heavens signifies divine intervention and revelation. In Jewish apocalyptic literature, the heavens opening is often associated with God revealing His will or presence. This moment echoes the prophetic vision of <a href="/isaiah/64.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>, where the prophet longs for God to rend the heavens and come down. It indicates a direct connection between heaven and earth, marking the commencement of Jesus' mission with divine authority.<p><b>and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove</b><br>The descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove is rich with symbolism. The dove is a symbol of peace, purity, and the presence of the Holy Spirit. In <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, the Spirit of God hovered over the waters during creation, and here, the Spirit descends upon Jesus, signifying a new creation and the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah. The dove also recalls the story of Noah, where a dove signaled the end of the flood and the beginning of a new era (<a href="/genesis/8-8.htm">Genesis 8:8-12</a>). This event fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah, endowing Him with wisdom, understanding, and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being baptized by John the Baptist.

He saw. Elsewhere we are told (<a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32</a>) that St. John the Baptist saw this descent. The earliest heretics took advantage of this statement to represent this event as the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus for personal indwelling. Later critics have adopted this view. But it need hardly be said here that such an opinion is altogether inconsistent with all that we read elsewhere of the circumstances of the Incarnation, and of the intimate and indissoluble union of the Divine and human natures in the person of the one Christ, from the time of the "overshadowing of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Highest." The Spirit descending upon him at his baptism was not the descent of the eternal Christ upon the man Jesus. It was rather the conveyance to one who was already prepared for it as God and man, of office and authority as the great Prophet that should come into the world. St. Luke says particularly (<a href="/luke/3-21.htm">Luke 3:21</a>) that it was when Jesus had been baptized and was praying, that the Holy Spirit descended upon him; plainly showing us that it was not through the baptism of John, but through the meritorious obedience and the prayer of the Son of God, that the heavens were "rent asunder," and the Holy Spirit descended upon him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As soon [as Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
