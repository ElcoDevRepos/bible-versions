It connects to the prophetic fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where a voice cries out in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord. This was a time of great expectation among the Jewish people for the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee</b><br>Nazareth was a small, seemingly insignificant town in the region of Galilee. This fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). Galilee was a region often looked down upon by Judeans, yet it was here that Jesus spent much of His early life, emphasizing His humble beginnings and connection to the common people. This also highlights the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light coming from Galilee.<p><b>and was baptized by John</b><br>John the Baptist's role was to prepare the way for the Messiah, calling people to repentance. Jesus' baptism by John, despite being sinless, signifies His identification with humanity and His willingness to fulfill all righteousness (<a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>). It marks the beginning of His public ministry and serves as a model for Christian baptism, symbolizing repentance and the washing away of sins.<p><b>in the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River holds significant historical and spiritual importance in Israel's history. It was the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>) and where Elijah was taken up to heaven (<a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8-11</a>).
