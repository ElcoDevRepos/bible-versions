This led to the expectation that Elijah would return before the coming of the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>. The people&#8217;s speculation that Jesus might be Elijah reflects their anticipation of messianic fulfillment and their recognition of Jesus' powerful ministry. Elijah was known for his miracles and confrontation with idolatry, which parallels Jesus' miraculous works and His challenge to the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>and still others, &#8220;He is a prophet,</b><br>Prophets in Israel were seen as God&#8217;s messengers, delivering His word to the people. By calling Jesus a prophet, the people acknowledged His authoritative teaching and His role in revealing God&#8217;s will. This reflects a recognition of Jesus' divine authority, similar to the prophets of the Old Testament who called Israel back to faithfulness. Jesus&#8217; ministry included elements typical of prophetic activity, such as performing miracles, teaching with authority, and calling for repentance.<p><b>like one of the prophets of old.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates a comparison between Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, who were known for their powerful messages and often faced opposition. The people&#8217;s reference to &#8220;prophets of old&#8221; suggests a recognition of Jesus&#8217; continuity with the prophetic tradition, yet it also shows a limited understanding of His true identity as the Son of God. The comparison underscores the expectation of a prophetic voice in Israel, which Jesus fulfilled, but it stops short of acknowledging His unique role as the Messiah. This reflects the varied responses to Jesus&#8217; ministry and the struggle to comprehend His full identity and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful miracles and confrontation with the prophets of Baal.
