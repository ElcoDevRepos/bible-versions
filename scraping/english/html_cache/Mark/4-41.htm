In biblical context, fear often accompanies the realization of God's presence, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>. This fear is not just terror but a profound awe and reverence for the divine authority displayed by Jesus. The disciples' fear contrasts with the peace and authority of Jesus, highlighting their human limitations and lack of understanding.<p><b>they asked one another</b><br>This phrase indicates a moment of collective reflection and discussion among the disciples. It shows their struggle to comprehend the full identity and authority of Jesus. In the cultural context of the time, rabbis and teachers were respected, but the disciples are beginning to see that Jesus is far beyond a typical teacher. This questioning is a step in their journey of faith and understanding, as seen in other instances where they grapple with Jesus' identity (e.g., <a href="/mark/8-27.htm">Mark 8:27-30</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Who is this</b><br>The question reflects the disciples' growing realization that Jesus is more than a prophet or teacher. This moment is pivotal in the Gospel of Mark, as it challenges the reader to consider Jesus' true identity. The question echoes throughout the Gospel, inviting readers to explore the nature of Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God. It connects to other scriptural revelations of Jesus' identity, such as Peter's confession in <a href="/mark/8-29.htm">Mark 8:29</a>.<p><b>that even the wind and the sea obey Him?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights Jesus' authority over nature, a power attributed only to God in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>, <a href="/psalms/107-29.htm">Psalm 107:29</a>). The calming of the storm is a demonstration of Jesus' divine authority, fulfilling prophecies and typologies of God's control over creation. It also prefigures the ultimate peace and order Jesus will bring to the world. The obedience of the wind and sea serves as a testament to Jesus' divine nature, reinforcing His identity as the Creator and Sustainer of all things.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who calms the storm, demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are with Him in the boat.

This holy fear is the seedbed of true worship and obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked one another</b><p>- Instead of celebrating, they turn to conversation. The communal questioning shows how Jesus&#8217; works push people to think, talk, and decide.<p>- Similar ripple effects appear elsewhere:<p>&#8226; After an exorcism, &#8220;They were all so amazed that they asked one another, &#8216;What is this? A new teaching&#8212;with authority!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; On Pentecost, the crowd was &#8220;amazed and perplexed&#8230;&#8216;What does this mean?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-12.htm">Acts 2:12</a>).<p>- Faith often grows in shared reflection; the disciples process awe together, edging toward a clearer confession of Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who is this&#8221;</b><p>- This question sits at the heart of the Gospel: identity precedes application.<p>- Earlier miracles hinted at His uniqueness, but commanding nature raises the stakes.<p>- Jesus Himself later presses the same issue: &#8220;But who do you say I am?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-15.htm">Matthew 16:15</a>). Peter&#8217;s answer, &#8220;You are the Christ,&#8221; becomes the rock of the church.<p>- The crowds ask, &#8220;Who are You claiming to be?&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>). Every soul must face that question. The disciples&#8217; fear ushers them to it sooner.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that even the wind and the sea obey Him</b><p>- In Scripture, only God rules seas:<p>&#8226; &#8220;You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-29.htm">Psalm 107:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord asks Job, &#8220;Who shut up the sea behind doors&#8230;when I said, &#8216;This far you may come and no farther&#8217;?&#8221; (<a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>- By calming wind and water with a word, Jesus reveals Himself as Creator in the flesh, holding absolute sovereignty.<p>- Practical implications:<p>&#8226; No force of nature overrides His will.<p>&#8226; Circumstances that terrify us are still under His command.<p>&#8226; The proper response is trust, not panic, because He remains in the boat.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a> records the disciples moving from fear of danger to fear of the Divine. Their awestruck question, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; invites every reader to recognize Jesus as the Lord who commands creation.
