This reaction highlights their cultural context, where wealth was often seen as a sign of God's favor. The disciples' surprise indicates a challenge to their understanding of righteousness and divine blessing. This astonishment is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where Jesus' teachings often subvert societal norms and expectations.<p><b>and said to one another</b><br>This phrase suggests a communal reflection among the disciples, indicating their close-knit relationship and shared journey of understanding Jesus' teachings. It reflects the rabbinic tradition of discussing and debating teachings to gain deeper insight. The disciples' dialogue is a model for Christian community, emphasizing the importance of fellowship and collective discernment in faith.<p><b>&#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221;</b><br>This question underscores the disciples' realization of the impossibility of salvation through human means alone. It echoes the broader biblical theme of human insufficiency and the need for divine intervention. The question connects to other scriptural passages emphasizing salvation by grace, such as <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>. It also points to the central Christian doctrine that salvation is made possible through Jesus Christ, who fulfills the law and prophets, offering redemption to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the challenges of entering the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present during this teaching.

Now their surprise deepens.<p>&#8226; Similar reactions surface earlier: &#8220;They were all astonished at His teaching&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>), showing that every fresh revelation of Jesus exposes human expectations as too small.<p>&#8226; Their heightened amazement reminds us that God&#8217;s standards overturn common assumptions, whether about wealth, status, or personal effort (see <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to one another</b><p>&#8226; Instead of directing their confusion to Jesus, they first turn to each other&#8212;an honest snapshot of how believers often process challenging truth in community.<p>&#8226; After Jesus calmed the storm, &#8220;They were terrified and asked one another, &#8216;Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>). Here the pattern repeats: shared conversation reveals shared need.<p>&#8226; Luke shows the same dynamic on the Emmaus road: &#8220;They asked one another, &#8216;Were not our hearts burning within us&#8230;?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>). God invites discussion that leads to deeper understanding, yet the ultimate answer must still come from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who then can be saved?</b><p>&#8226; The question lays bare the deeper issue: if even the successful and outwardly blessed cannot enter on their own, what hope exists for anyone?<p>&#8226; Jesus answers immediately in the next verse: &#8220;With man this is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-27.htm">Mark 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently underscores this truth:<p>&#8211; &#8220;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;For it is by grace you have been saved through faith&#8230; not by works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; question therefore steers us to the core of the gospel: salvation is God&#8217;s work alone, granted to those who trust Him rather than themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/10-26.htm">Mark 10:26</a> captures the disciples&#8217; dawning realization that human ability, wealth, or merit cannot secure eternal life.
