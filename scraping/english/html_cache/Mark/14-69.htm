The servant girl is likely a doorkeeper, a position often held by women in ancient households. Her recognition of Peter suggests that she may have seen him with Jesus during His public ministry. This moment fulfills Jesus' earlier prediction that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed twice (<a href="/mark/14-30.htm">Mark 14:30</a>).<p><b>and again said to those standing nearby</b><br>This indicates that the servant girl had previously identified Peter, showing persistence in her accusation. The repetition emphasizes the pressure Peter faced and the growing tension in the courtyard. The crowd's presence adds to the intimidation, as they are likely supporters of the high priest and hostile to Jesus' followers. This scenario highlights the social dynamics and the fear of association with a condemned man.<p><b>&#8220;This man is one of them.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "one of them" refers to Jesus' disciples, marking Peter as a follower of Christ. This identification is significant because it places Peter in a position of potential danger, as Jesus is being tried for blasphemy and claiming to be the Messiah. The accusation is a test of Peter's loyalty and faith, contrasting with his earlier bold declarations of unwavering support for Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-29.htm">Mark 14:29-31</a>).
