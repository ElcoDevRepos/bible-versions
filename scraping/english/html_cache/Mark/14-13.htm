This practice not only provided companionship and mutual support but also adhered to the Jewish principle of two witnesses establishing a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). The sending of the disciples here demonstrates Jesus' authority and His role as a teacher and leader, preparing for the Passover, a significant Jewish festival.<p><b>Go into the city</b><br>The city referred to is Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple. Jerusalem holds deep historical and theological significance, being the city of David and the prophesied place of the Messiah's suffering and triumph (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>). This instruction highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' mission and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and a man carrying a jug of water will meet you</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, carrying water was typically a woman's task. Therefore, a man carrying a jug of water would stand out, making him easy to identify. This detail underscores Jesus' foreknowledge and divine orchestration of events. It also reflects the theme of divine provision and guidance, as seen in other biblical narratives where God provides specific instructions to His people (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2-4</a>).<p><b>Follow him</b><br>The instruction to follow the man carrying the water jug is an act of obedience and trust in Jesus' words. It mirrors the call to discipleship, where following Jesus requires faith and submission to His guidance. This act also sets the stage for the preparation of the Last Supper, a pivotal event in the New Testament that symbolizes the new covenant through Jesus' sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, Jesus is preparing for the Passover with His disciples.

This sending also echoes the Father&#8217;s mission for the Son (<a href="/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus directs every detail of His redemptive timetable.<p>&#8226; The disciples model ready obedience without debate, much like Abraham&#8217;s servant in <a href="/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12</a> &#8211; 15.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go into the city</b><p>Jerusalem is the appointed place for the Passover (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5</a> &#8211; 6), and Jesus&#8217; command positions the disciples right where prophecy unfolds.

The sign of the pitcher of water is common to both Gospels, but not to St. Matthew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he sendeth two of his disciples</span>. St. Luke (<a href="/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>) informs us that these two were Peter and John. It is characteristic of St. Mark's Gospel throughout that Peter is never mentioned oftener than is necessary. <span class="cmt_word">Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water</span>. The bearing of the pitcher of water was not without its meaning. It was a solemn religious act preparatory to the Passover. This man bearing a pitcher of water was not the master or owner of the house. The owner is distinguished afterwards by the name <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or "goodman of the house." The owner must, therefore, have been a man of some substance, and probably a friend if not a disciple of our Lord. Tradition says that this was the house of John whose surname was Mark; and that it was in this house that the disciples were assembled on the evening of our Lord's resurrection, and where, also, they received the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost. It was to this house that Peter betook himself when he was delivered by the angel out of prison. Hence it was known, as one of the earliest places of Christian worship, by the name of "Coenaculum Sion; "and here was built a church, called the Church of Sion. It was the oldest church in Jerusalem, and was called by St. Cyril, "the upper church of the apostles."
