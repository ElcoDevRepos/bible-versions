The "word of God" refers to the Scriptures, which were considered the ultimate authority. The religious leaders of Jesus' time often elevated their traditions to a level that overshadowed the Scriptures. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. The nullification implies a deliberate undermining of God's authority, which is a serious charge against the religious leaders.<p><b>by the tradition you have handed down.</b><br>The "tradition" refers to the oral laws and customs developed by the Pharisees and scribes, which were meant to interpret and apply the written Law of Moses. These traditions, known as the "Oral Torah," were eventually codified in the Mishnah. The phrase "handed down" suggests a generational transmission, indicating that these practices were deeply entrenched. This reflects a broader cultural context where oral tradition was a primary means of preserving and transmitting religious teachings. However, Jesus criticizes these traditions for overshadowing the true intent of God's commandments.<p><b>And you do so in many such matters.&#8221;</b><br>This indicates that the issue at hand was not isolated but part of a broader pattern of behavior. The religious leaders were consistently prioritizing their traditions over God's commands. This critique is not limited to the specific example of Corban (mentioned earlier in the chapter) but extends to various aspects of religious life. It underscores a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry: the call to return to the heart of God's law, which is love and justice, rather than mere ritual compliance. This critique aligns with other scriptural passages where Jesus challenges the Pharisees, such as <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, where He condemns their hypocrisy and legalism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and scribes, challenging their adherence to human traditions over God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who were known for their strict adherence to Jewish law and traditions.
