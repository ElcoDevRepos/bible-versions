This area is located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, a region known for its mixed population of Jews and Gentiles. The fact that he saw Jesus from a distance suggests the man's awareness of Jesus' presence, possibly indicating the spiritual recognition of Jesus' authority by the demons within him. This moment highlights the pervasive influence of Jesus' ministry, even in Gentile territories.<p><b>he ran</b><br>The act of running signifies urgency and desperation. In the cultural context, running was often seen as undignified, especially for a man. This action underscores the man's desperate need for deliverance and the compelling power of Jesus' presence. It also reflects the spiritual turmoil within him, as the demons recognize the authority of Jesus and are compelled to confront Him.<p><b>and fell on his knees before Him</b><br>Falling on one's knees is a posture of submission and worship. This act can be seen as an acknowledgment of Jesus' divine authority, even by the demonic forces. In biblical terms, kneeling is often associated with prayer and supplication, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, where every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus. This moment foreshadows the ultimate submission of all spiritual forces to Christ's authority. The man's physical posture contrasts with his spiritual bondage, highlighting the tension between the demonic influence and the recognition of Jesus' lordship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who demonstrates authority over nature, sickness, and spiritual forces.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demon-possessed_man.htm">The Demon-Possessed Man</a></b><br>A man tormented by an unclean spirit, living among the tombs, isolated from society due to his condition.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gadara.htm">Gadara (or Gerasenes)</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, located on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee, known for its Gentile population.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who witness His power and authority over demonic forces.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirits.htm">The Unclean Spirits</a></b><br>Demonic entities that recognize Jesus' divine authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_authority.htm">Recognition of Authority</a></b><br>The demon-possessed man's immediate reaction to Jesus demonstrates the recognition of divine authority.

The demoniac&#8217;s perception highlights the Lord&#8217;s authority that transcends space (cf. <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>).<p>&#8226; His sight of Jesus contrasts with the isolation he has endured among the tombs (<a href="/mark/5-3.htm">Mark 5:3-5</a>), showing that no distance or bondage is too great for Christ to bridge (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The man&#8217;s recognition is immediate and involuntary, underscoring that the spiritual realm recognizes Jesus&#8217; lordship before human hearts often do (<a href="/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he ran</b><p>&#8226; The verb paints urgency: the man does not stroll or hesitate; he bolts toward deliverance (<a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17</a>; <a href="/luke/19-6.htm">Luke 19:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Running signals desperation mixed with hope&#8212;he senses the only remedy for his torment is standing on that shoreline (<a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This movement also illustrates that genuine encounters with Jesus provoke motion, not passivity (<a href="/john/4-29.htm">John 4:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fell on his knees before Him</b><p>&#8226; Kneeling expresses submission; even the legion of demons cannot remain standing before the Son of God (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The posture prefigures worship: what begins as compelled acknowledgement soon becomes a public testimony of Jesus&#8217; saving power (<a href="/mark/5-18.htm">Mark 5:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; His kneeling contrasts sharply with his previous violence (<a href="/mark/5-4.htm">Mark 5:4</a>).

These words, "from afar," explain the fact of our Lord being immediately met by the man as soon as he left the boat. Vers. 3-5 inclusive must be regarded as parenthetical. They describe the ordinary condition of the demoniac, and his sad wild life from day to day. From the high ground which he frequented he had seen the boat, in which Jesus was, nearing the shore. He had seen the other boats. Perhaps he had seen the sudden rise of the storm and its equally sudden suppression; and he, like others who witnessed it, was affected by it. So he hastened to the shore; <span class="cmt_word">he ran and worshipped him</span>.
