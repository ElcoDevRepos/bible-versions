Arimathea is believed to be a town in Judea, though its exact location is uncertain. Joseph is described in all four Gospels, highlighting his importance. He is a wealthy man (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57</a>) and a secret disciple of Jesus (<a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a>), which fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a> that the Messiah would be with a rich man in His death.<p><b>a prominent Council member</b><br>Joseph is a member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. This detail is significant because the Sanhedrin played a role in condemning Jesus. Joseph's position indicates his influence and status within Jewish society. His involvement in Jesus' burial shows a divergence from the council's general stance, suggesting his personal conviction and courage.<p><b>who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God</b><br>This phrase indicates Joseph's spiritual anticipation and hope for the messianic kingdom, aligning him with other devout Jews who awaited God's promised deliverance. It connects to Simeon and Anna in <a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25-38</a>, who also awaited the kingdom. Joseph's faith in the coming kingdom suggests he recognized Jesus as the Messiah.<p><b>boldly went to Pilate</b><br>Approaching Pilate required courage, especially given the political and social tensions surrounding Jesus' crucifixion. Joseph's boldness contrasts with the fear of the disciples, who had fled. This act of courage demonstrates his commitment to Jesus, despite potential repercussions from both Roman authorities and his peers in the Sanhedrin.<p><b>to ask for the body of Jesus</b><br>Requesting Jesus' body was a significant act of devotion and respect. Roman custom often left crucified bodies unburied, but Joseph's request ensured Jesus received a proper burial. This act fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a> and demonstrated Joseph's reverence for Jesus. It also highlights the importance of burial practices in Jewish culture, emphasizing the dignity and honor Joseph sought to provide for Jesus in death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph_of_arimathea.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a></b><br>A respected member of the Jewish council (Sanhedrin) who was secretly a disciple of Jesus.

Though <a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38</a> admits he had been a secret disciple &#8220;for fear of the Jews,&#8221; Mark now shows Joseph moving from quiet sympathy to open allegiance. His name reminds us that God always has faithful witnesses in every sphere, even among the influential (cf. <a href="/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A prominent Council member</b><p>Mark emphasizes Joseph&#8217;s status as &#8220;a prominent Council member,&#8221; that is, a respected member of the Sanhedrin.

This expectancy set him apart from leaders who preferred earthly power (<a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>). By attending to prophecy and promise, Joseph recognized that God&#8217;s kingdom would prevail even in the darkness of Golgotha.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Boldly went to Pilate</b><p>Mark notes he &#8220;boldly went to Pilate.&#8221; The Greek verb implies courage; the rightly captures the daring move.

His bold request satisfies Jewish law, fulfills prophecy, and sets the stage for the empty tomb. The verse teaches that genuine expectation of God&#8217;s kingdom compels believers to act with integrity and bravery, no matter the cost, trusting that every step of obedience fits perfectly into God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">Joseph of Arimathsea.</span>--The account given of him is fuller than in St. Matthew.

St. Jerome says that this city was called Ramathaim-Zophim (the lofty place), where dwelt Elkanah and Hannah of old, and where Samuel was born. Joseph was most probably a native of Arimathaea; but he was now a citizen and counsellor of Jerusalem. He was an honorable counsellor (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">a councillor of honorable estate</span> (Revised Version).

St. Chrysostom says, "The courage of Joseph is greatly to be admired, in that, for the love of Christ, he exposed himself to the danger of death." The fact that he was "looking for the kingdom of God" explains his conduct. It shows that he believed in Christ, and through his grace hoped for everlasting salvation; and in this hope he thought little of shelving his reverence for Christ, and so" boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Joseph</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#963;&#8052;&#966;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;s&#275;ph)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2501.htm">Strong's 2501: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph, a proper name.
