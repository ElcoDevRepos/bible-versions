They played a crucial role in interpreting the Torah and were respected for their knowledge. The context here is a series of debates between Jesus and various Jewish leaders in the Temple courts in Jerusalem. This setting is significant as it was a central place for teaching and religious discourse. The scribe's approach indicates his interest in the theological discussions taking place, highlighting the public nature of Jesus' ministry and the scrutiny He faced from religious authorities.<p><b>Noticing how well Jesus had answered them,</b><br>Jesus had been engaged in a series of questions from the Sadducees and Pharisees, who were attempting to trap Him with theological and legal dilemmas. His ability to answer wisely and authoritatively impressed many, including this scribe. This reflects Jesus' profound understanding of the Scriptures and His divine wisdom, which often left His opponents unable to refute Him. It also fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah as one who would teach with authority (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>).<p><b>he asked Him, &#8220;Which commandment is the most important of all?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed by the scribe is significant in Jewish tradition, where the Law consists of 613 commandments. Debates about which commandment was the greatest were common among Jewish scholars. This question tests Jesus' understanding of the Law and His ability to prioritize its principles. Jesus' response, which follows in the subsequent verses, emphasizes love for God and neighbor, summarizing the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/22-40.htm">Matthew 22:40</a>).

One expert in the Law steps forward, signaling three things:<p>&#8226; Individual responsibility&#8212;though many scribes opposed Jesus as a block (<a href="/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>), this one approaches personally, echoing Nicodemus&#8217;s solitary visit in <a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1&#8211;2</a>.<p>&#8226; Respect for Scripture&#8212;scribes copied, taught, and defended the Law (<a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1&#8211;8</a>), so his presence underscores the seriousness of the moment.<p>&#8226; Divine appointment&#8212;God often positions a truth-seeker right after public confrontation, as He did with the Ethiopian official following Peter&#8217;s ministry in Samaria (<a href="/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and heard their debate</b><p>The scribe does not rely on hearsay; he listens to Jesus handle difficult challenges about taxes (<a href="/mark/12-17.htm">Mark 12:17</a>) and resurrection (<a href="/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24&#8211;27</a>).

Ancient rabbis counted 613 commands and debated their relative weight. This scribe seeks a definitive, authoritative answer. Jesus will soon respond by uniting <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;5</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>, showing that:<p>&#8226; Love for God is the greatest command, encompassing spirit, soul, mind, and strength (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Love for neighbor flows naturally from wholehearted devotion to God (<a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; All other commandments hinge on these two (<a href="/matthew/22-40.htm">Matthew 22:40</a>), demonstrating that obedience is relational, not merely ritual (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-28.htm">Mark 12:28</a> captures a pivotal moment: a learned scribe personally witnesses Jesus&#8217; perfect wisdom, recognizes its superiority, and poses the ultimate question about the Law&#8217;s core. His approach reveals that sincere inquiry meets divine clarity. Jesus will declare that supreme love for God&#8212;and the love for others it spawns&#8212;stands above every other command. The verse invites every reader to acknowledge Christ&#8217;s authority and align life with the greatest commandment confirmed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28-34) <span class= "bld">And one of the scribes came.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34-40</a>. St. Mark's description is somewhat less precise than St. Matthew's "one of them (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Pharisees), a lawyer." The form of the question differs by the substitution of "first of all" for "great" commandment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-34.htm">Matthew 22:34</a>) says here that the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together, and that then one of them, who was a lawyer (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), that is, "a scribe," asked him this question, <span class="cmt_word">What commandment is the first of all?</span> It appears here from St. Mark that this scribe had been present at the discussion with the Sadducees, and he had probably informed the others of what had taken place, and of the wisdom and power of our Lord's answer; so he was naturally put forward to try our Lord with another crucial question. It does not necessarily appear that he had an evil intention in putting this question. He may, in his own mind (seeing the wisdom and skill of our Lord), have desired to hear what Christ had to say to a very difficult question on a matter deeply interesting to all true Hebrews. The question was one much mooted amongst the Jews in the time of our Lord. "For many," says Beds, "thought that the first commandment in the Law related to offerings and sacrifices, with regard to which so much is said in Leviticus, and that the right worship of God consisted in the due offering of these." On this account the Pharisees encouraged children to say "Corban" to their parents; and hence this candid and truth-loving scribe, when he heard our Lord's answer about the love of God and of our neighbor, said that such obedience was worth "more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." With regard to the love of God, St. Bernard says, "The measure of our love to God is to love him without measure; for the immense goodness of God deserves all the love that we can possibly give to him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7991;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(heis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
