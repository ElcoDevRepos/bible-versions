In the context of <a href="/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>, Jesus had just sent out the twelve apostles two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits. This act of sending mirrors the Great Commission found in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to go and make disciples of all nations. The act of setting out also reflects the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry, which was common in the first-century Jewish context, where rabbis and their disciples would travel to teach.<p><b>and preached</b><br>Preaching here refers to the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom of God. The Greek word used for "preached" is "kerysso," which means to herald or proclaim publicly. This was a central aspect of Jesus' ministry and is seen throughout the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-14.htm">Mark 1:14-15</a>). The act of preaching was not just about delivering a message but was a call to action and transformation. The disciples were continuing the work of Jesus, spreading His teachings and the good news of salvation.<p><b>that the people should repent</b><br>Repentance is a key theme in the teachings of Jesus and the early church. The Greek word for repent, "metanoeo," means to change one's mind or to turn around. This call to repentance is consistent with the message of John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>) and Jesus Himself (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). Repentance involves a recognition of sin, a turning away from it, and a turning towards God. It is a foundational aspect of the Christian faith, emphasizing the need for a personal transformation and a restored relationship with God. This message of repentance is also echoed in the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament, where prophets called Israel to return to God (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve apostles whom Jesus sent out to preach and perform miracles.
