The scribe's answer reflects a deep understanding of the law, emphasizing love for God and neighbor. This wisdom aligns with the teachings of the Old Testament, particularly <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>. The scribe's insight shows a heart attuned to the core of God's commandments, which Jesus acknowledges.<p><b>He said, &#8220;You are not far from the kingdom of God.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' statement indicates that the scribe is close to understanding the true nature of God's kingdom, which is not merely about legalistic adherence to the law but about a heart transformed by love. The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. The scribe's proximity to the kingdom suggests that intellectual understanding must be coupled with faith and repentance to fully enter.<p><b>And no one dared to question Him any further.</b><br>This phrase highlights the authority and wisdom of Jesus. Throughout the Gospels, religious leaders often challenge Jesus, attempting to trap Him with difficult questions. However, His profound answers consistently reveal His divine insight and authority, leaving His challengers unable to refute Him. This moment underscores Jesus' role as the ultimate teacher and the embodiment of truth, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-4</a>, which speak of the Messiah's wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who acknowledges the scribe's wise answer and provides a profound insight into the proximity to the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scribe.htm">The Scribe</a></b><br>A Jewish legal expert who engages Jesus in a discussion about the greatest commandment.

Now, as when He spoke the Sermon on the Mount, the righteousness which fulfils the law is the condition of the entrance into the kingdom of God (<a href="/context/matthew/5-19.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:19-20</a>). Even the recognition of that righteousness as consisting in the fulfilment of the two commandments that were exceeding broad, brought a man as to the very threshold of the Kingdom. It is instructive to compare our Lord's different method of dealing, in <a href="/context/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25-37</a>, with one who had the same theoretical knowledge, but who obviously, consciously or unconsciously, minimised the force of the commandments by his narrowing definitions.<p><span class= "bld">And no man after that durst ask him.</span>--St. Mark states the fact before, St. Matthew after, the narrative that now follows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God</span>. It would appear from this answer that our Lord regarded him as one who approached him with the sincere desire to know the truth, and so he encouraged him. This shows how powerful an influence our Lord's teaching had already exercised amongst all classes of the Jews. This scribe, notwithstanding the prejudices of his class, had reached the border-land of the kingdom. He had learnt that the true way to the kingdom was by the love of God and of our neighbor. He was not far from the kingdom - not far from "the Church militant here on earth," by which is the way to the Church triumphant in heaven. He was not far from the kingdom, but still he wanted that which in the true pathway to the kingdom - faith in Christ as the Savior of the world. <span class="cmt_word">And no man after that durst ask him any question</span>. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-46.htm">Matthew 22:46</a>) places these words after the next occurrence. But there is no inconsistency in the two narratives, because in this next incident our Lord puts the question to them; and this silenced both their questioning and their answering.
