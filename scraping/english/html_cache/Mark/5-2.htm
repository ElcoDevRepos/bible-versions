The Sea of Galilee, where Jesus disembarked, was a central location for His ministry, often serving as a boundary between Jewish and Gentile territories. This setting underscores the crossing of cultural and spiritual boundaries, as Jesus brings His ministry to a predominantly Gentile area, the region of the Gerasenes.<p><b>He was met by a man with an unclean spirit</b><br>The term "unclean spirit" refers to demonic possession, a condition recognized in Jewish tradition as a severe spiritual affliction. This encounter highlights Jesus' authority over spiritual realms, a theme prevalent throughout the Gospels. The presence of demonic forces in the world is acknowledged in various scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare. This man's condition also reflects the broader human struggle with sin and evil, which Jesus came to overcome.<p><b>who was coming from the tombs</b><br>Tombs were often located outside city limits and were considered ritually unclean according to Jewish law (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). The man's dwelling among the tombs symbolizes his separation from society and spiritual death. This setting also foreshadows the resurrection power of Christ, who brings life to places of death. The imagery of tombs connects to other biblical instances where God brings life from death, such as Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones (Ezekiel 37).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who demonstrates His authority over spiritual realms in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_an_unclean_spirit.htm">The Man with an Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>A man possessed by demons, living among the tombs, representing the spiritual bondage and isolation caused by sin and demonic influence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tombs.htm">The Tombs</a></b><br>These were burial places outside the city, often associated with death and impurity, symbolizing the spiritual death and separation from God experienced by the possessed man.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_spirit.htm">The Unclean Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the demonic presence within the man, highlighting the reality of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shore.htm">The Shore</a></b><br>The place where Jesus arrives, signifying the transition from one mission to another, and the beginning of a powerful demonstration of His authority over evil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus.htm">Authority of Jesus</a></b><br>Recognize and trust in the supreme authority of Jesus over all spiritual forces.

St. Mark and St. Luke, it will be noticed, speak of one only; St. Matthew of two.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit</span>. St. Matthew says that there were two. St. Luke, like St. Mark, mentions only one, and him "possessed with devils," The one mentioned by St. Mark was no doubt the more prominent and fierce of the two. This does not mean merely a person with a disordered intellect. No doubt, in this case, as in that of insanity, physical causes may have helped to lay the victim open to such an incursion; and this may account for cases of possession being enumerated with various sicknesses, though distinguished from them. But our Lord evidently deals with these persons, not as persons suffering from insanity, but as the subjects of an alien spiritual power, external to themselves. He addresses the unclean spirit through the man that was possessed, and says," Come forth thou unclean spirit" (Ver. 8). <span class="accented">There met him out of the tombs.</span> The Jews did not have their burial-places in their cities, lest they should be defiled; therefore they buried their dead without the gates in the fields or mountains. Their sepulchres were frequently hewn out of the rock in the sides of the limestone hills, and they were lofty and capacious; so that the living could enter them, as into a vault. So this demoniac dwelt in the tombs, because the unclean spirit drove him thither, where the associations of the place would accord with his malady and aggravate its symptoms. St. Matthew, speaking of the two, says that they were "exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass that way." The demoniac particularly mentioned by St. Mark is described as having been possessed of that extraordinary muscular strength which maniacs so often put forth; so that all efforts to bind and restrain him had proved ineffectual. No man could any more bind him, no, not with a chain (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7b;</span>). Chains and fetters had often been tried, but in vain. Frequently too, in the paroxysms of his malady, he would turn his violence against himself, crying out, and cutting himself with stones<span class="cmt_word">.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
