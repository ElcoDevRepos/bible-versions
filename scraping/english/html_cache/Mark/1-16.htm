It is significant in the New Testament as the site of many of Jesus' teachings and miracles. The area around the Sea of Galilee was a bustling hub of activity, with fishing being a primary industry. This setting underscores Jesus' ministry among ordinary people in everyday settings. The Sea of Galilee is also a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light coming to the region of Galilee.<p><b>He saw Simon and his brother Andrew</b><br>Simon, later called Peter, and Andrew were among the first disciples called by Jesus. They were brothers from Bethsaida, a town near the Sea of Galilee. Their calling marks the beginning of Jesus' gathering of His disciples, who would become the foundation of the early Church. The choice of these men, who were not religious leaders or scholars, highlights the theme of God using ordinary people for His purposes. This moment is also a fulfillment of Jesus' mission to seek and save the lost, as He initiates the call to follow Him.<p><b>They were casting a net into the sea</b><br>Fishing was a common occupation in Galilee, and casting nets was a typical method used by fishermen. This detail emphasizes the everyday life and work of the people Jesus called to follow Him. The act of casting a net can be seen as symbolic of the evangelistic mission that Jesus would later entrust to His disciples, as they would become "fishers of men" (<a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a>). This imagery is consistent with the prophetic language found in <a href="/jeremiah/16-16.htm">Jeremiah 16:16</a>, where God speaks of sending fishermen to gather His people.<p><b>for they were fishermen</b><br>The profession of fishing required hard work, patience, and perseverance, qualities that would be essential for the disciples in their future ministry. The fact that Jesus chose fishermen as His first disciples underscores the idea that His kingdom is accessible to all, regardless of social status or occupation. This choice also reflects the humility and servanthood that Jesus exemplified throughout His ministry. The calling of fishermen is a reminder of the transformative power of Jesus' call, as these men would leave their nets to follow Him and become leaders in the early Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who begins His public ministry by calling His first disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon.htm">Simon (Peter)</a></b><br>One of the first disciples called by Jesus, who would later become a leading figure in the early church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/andrew.htm">Andrew</a></b><br>Simon Peter's brother, also called by Jesus to be a disciple.

He then passed along by the seashore towards Capernaum; and on his way found the four disciples whom he had previously nominated, but who were now engaged in their calling of fishermen. St. Mark then relates the circumstances of their call in the exact words of St. Matthew, which were in all probability those of apostolical tradition ('Speaker's Commentary'). It will be seen that St. Mark's account, in this introductory portion of his Gospel, is very concise, and that there are many things to be supplied from the first chapter of St. John; as, for example, that after our Lord's baptism by John, and afar his fasting and temptation in the desert, the Jews sent messengers to the Baptist, to inquire of him whether he were the Christ. John at once confessed that he was not the Christ, but that there was One even then among them, though they knew him not, who was indeed the Christ And then, the very next day after, Jesus came to him, and John then said to those around him, "Behold the Lamb of God!" Upon this two of John's disciples at once betook-themselves to Jesus. The first was Andrew, who forthwith brought his own brother Simon, afterwards called "Peter," to our Lord. Again, the day after the, our Lord called Philip, a fellow-citizen with Andrew and Peter, of Bethsaida. Then Philip brought Nathanael. Here, then, we have some more disciples nominated, who were with Jesus at the marriage in Cana of Galilee. Then Jesus retched again into Judaea; and those disciples "nominate," as we might call them, went back for a time to their occupation of fishermen. Meanwhile our Lord, while in Judaea, wrought miracles and preached, until the envy of the scribes and Pharisees constrained him to return again into Galilee. And then it was that he solemnly called Andrew and Peter, and James and John, as recorded by St. Mark here. So that St John alone gives some account of the events of the first year of our Lord's ministry. The three synoptic Gospels give the narrative of his public ministry, commencing from the second year. <span class="cmt_word">He saw Simon and Andrew, the</span> <span class="cmt_word">brother of Simon casting a net in the sea.</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). Such was the text underlying the Authorized Version; but a better reading is (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span>). St. Mark thinks it unnecessary to mention the net at all; though doubtless it was the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or casting-net. When our Lord likens <span class="cmt_word">his gospel to a net, he uses the</span> figure of the drag-not (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), a net of a much larger size. But whether it be the casting-net or the drag-net, the comparison is a striking one. It is plain that, in the pursuit of his calling, the fisherman has no power to make any separation between the good fish and the worthless. He has little or no insight into what is going on beneath the surface of the water. So with the "fisher of men." He deals with the world spiritual and invisible; and how, then, can he be fully conscious of the results of his work? His work is pre-eminently a work of faith. It may be observed here that St. Mark, in this earlier part of his narrative, speaks of St. Peter as Simon, though afterwards (<a href="/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16</a>) he calls him Peter. We may also notice here, once for all, St. Mark's constant use of the word "straightway" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). This word occurs no less than ten times in this chapter. In the Authorized Version the word (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)is rendered indifferently by various English synonyms, as "forthwith," "immediately," etc.; whereas in the Revised Version it has been thought fit to note this peculiarity or mannerism in St. Mark's Gospel by the use of the same English synonym, "straightway," throughout this Gospel. The Holy Spirit, while guiding the minds of those whom he moved to write these records, did not use an overpowering influence, so as to interfere with their own natural modes of expression. Each sacred writer, while guarded against error, has reserved to him his own peculiarities of style and expression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/1-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] was walking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(parag&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3855.htm">Strong's 3855: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass by, depart, pass away.
