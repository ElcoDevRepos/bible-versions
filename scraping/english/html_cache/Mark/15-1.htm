The timing suggests that the events took place shortly after dawn, which was customary for legal proceedings in Jewish culture. This early timing also reflects the leaders' desire to conclude the matter before the Passover festivities began in earnest.<p><b>the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin</b><br>These groups represent the highest levels of Jewish religious authority. The chief priests were primarily Sadducees, responsible for temple rituals. The elders were respected leaders within the community, often from influential families. The scribes were experts in the Law, often Pharisees, who interpreted and taught the Scriptures. The Sanhedrin was the supreme council and tribunal of the Jews, consisting of 71 members, including the high priest. This assembly's involvement underscores the gravity of the charges against Jesus and the unified front of the Jewish leadership against Him.<p><b>devised a plan</b><br>The plan was to bring Jesus before the Roman authorities, as the Sanhedrin lacked the power to execute capital punishment under Roman rule. This phrase highlights the premeditated nature of their actions, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, which speaks of rulers conspiring against the Lord's Anointed. Their plan was not just a legal maneuver but a fulfillment of divine prophecy regarding the Messiah's suffering.<p><b>They bound Jesus</b><br>Binding Jesus was a customary practice for someone considered a criminal, signifying His status as a prisoner. This act of binding is symbolic of the spiritual bondage of sin that Jesus came to break. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is led like a lamb to the slaughter.<p><b>led Him away</b><br>This phrase indicates the transition from Jewish to Roman jurisdiction. Jesus being led away signifies His submission to the Father's will, as He willingly goes to face His accusers. It also reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>, where the servant is taken away by oppression and judgment.<p><b>and handed Him over to Pilate</b><br>Pontius Pilate was the Roman governor of Judea, responsible for maintaining order and executing justice. The Jewish leaders handed Jesus over to Pilate to secure a death sentence, as only the Roman authorities could legally carry out executions. This act of handing over is significant in the narrative of Jesus' passion, as it marks the beginning of the Roman trial. It also fulfills Jesus' own predictions about His death, as seen in <a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>, where He foretells being delivered to the Gentiles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests.htm">Chief Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for temple rituals and maintaining Jewish law.

But there was another law which was also violated. It was now Friday. In capital cases, sentence of condemnation might not legally be pronounced on the day of the trial.
