This reflects the urgency and authority of His ministry. The use of "immediately" here underscores the miraculous nature of the healing, indicating that it was not a gradual process but an instantaneous event, showcasing Jesus' divine power.<p><b>the leprosy left him</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times was a term used for various skin diseases, not just what is known today as Hansen's disease. It rendered individuals ceremonially unclean, isolating them from the community (Leviticus 13-14). The healing of leprosy was seen as a sign of divine intervention, as it was considered incurable by human means. This act demonstrates Jesus' authority over physical ailments and His ability to restore individuals to both physical health and social inclusion.<p><b>and the man was cleansed</b><br>The cleansing of the leper is significant not only as a physical healing but also as a spiritual and social restoration. In the Jewish context, being cleansed meant the man could return to worship in the temple and reintegrate into society. This act of cleansing is symbolic of Jesus' mission to purify and redeem humanity from sin. It also fulfills the messianic prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who brings healing and liberation. The cleansing here prefigures the ultimate cleansing from sin that Jesus offers through His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of healing.

There is no interval between the command and the work of Christ. "He spake, and it was done." His will is his omnipotence. By this act Christ showed that he came into the world as a great Physician, that he might cure all diseases, and cleanse us from all our defilements. The word "straightway" shows that Christ healed the leper, not by any natural means, but by a Divine power which works instantly. He is alike powerful both to commend and to do. St. Matthew says here (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>) that straightway "his leprosy was cleansed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>).
