The fact that it was bought just before the Sabbath began is peculiar to St. Mark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he bought a linen</span> <span class="cmt_word">cloth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). This was a fine linen garment, or shroud, something like that in which the young man fled the night before (<a href="/mark/14-51.htm">Mark 14:51, 52</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And taking him down</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>). It appears from these words that Joseph himself, assisted probably by Nicodemus and others, actually took the body of our Lord down from the cross. wrapped the <span class="accented">sindon</span> round him, and laid him in his own new tomb, which had been hewn out of the rock. The word rendered "tomb" is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as being intended to be a memorial of the departed. <span class="cmt_word">And he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> The door here means "the opening," or "entrance." Thus, while our Lord died with the wicked, he was with the rich in his death (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Joseph] bought</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(agorasas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_59.htm">Strong's 59: </a> </span><span class="str2">To buy.
