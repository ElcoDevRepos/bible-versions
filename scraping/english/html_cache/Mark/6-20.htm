Herod's fear was not just political but also personal, as he recognized John's integrity and the potential divine judgment for harming a prophet. This protection can be seen as a reluctant respect for John's character and message, despite Herod's eventual capitulation to Herodias's demands. This reflects the tension between political power and spiritual authority, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in the interactions between Pharaoh and Moses.<p><b>knowing that he was a righteous and holy man</b><br>John the Baptist's reputation as a righteous and holy man was well-known, and even Herod acknowledged this. Righteousness in biblical terms often refers to living in accordance with God's laws, while holiness implies being set apart for God's purposes. John's lifestyle, message of repentance, and baptism for the forgiveness of sins set him apart as a prophet. This recognition by Herod highlights the universal acknowledgment of John's moral and spiritual authority, similar to how even non-believers recognized the integrity of figures like Daniel in the Old Testament.<p><b>When he heard John&#8217;s words, he was greatly perplexed</b><br>Herod's perplexity upon hearing John's words suggests an internal conflict. While he was intrigued by John's message, it also challenged his lifestyle and authority. This mirrors the reaction of many who encounter the truth of God's word, as seen in <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>, where Felix is alarmed by Paul's message. The perplexity indicates a struggle between conviction and the unwillingness to change, a common human experience when confronted with divine truth.<p><b>yet he listened to him gladly</b><br>Despite his perplexity, Herod found a certain pleasure in listening to John. This indicates that Herod was drawn to the truth and the power of John's message, even if he was not willing to fully embrace it. This paradox of being drawn to yet resisting the truth is seen in other biblical accounts, such as King Agrippa's reaction to Paul's testimony in <a href="/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>. Herod's gladness in listening to John suggests a recognition of the truth and beauty in John's message, even if it was not fully accepted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, son of Herod the Great.

Nor is there any inconsistency in the next clause in St. Mark, if we accept this reading. Herod was not utterly depraved. There was to him a charm, not only in the character, but in the discourses of John the Baptist. But he was an inconsistent man, and was continually the victim of a conflict between the good and the evil within him, in which evil, alas! triumphed. Herodias, on the other hand, had always wished to get rid of John, as the stern and uncompromising reprover of her adultery and incest; and so at length she persuaded Herod to give way. "For," says Bede, "she feared lest Herod should at length repent, and yield to the exhortations of John, and dissolve this unreal marriage, and restore Herodias to her lawful husband." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
