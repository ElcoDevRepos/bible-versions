Jesus uses this title to emphasize both His humanity and His divine mission. The phrase "just as it is written about Him" indicates the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah's suffering and death, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. These prophecies highlight the predetermined plan of God for redemption through the suffering of the Messiah.<p><b>but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!</b><br>This part of the verse introduces a solemn warning to Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would betray Jesus. The term "woe" is a pronouncement of judgment and sorrow, often used by prophets in the Old Testament to declare divine displeasure and impending doom (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>). The betrayal by Judas is a pivotal event in the Passion narrative, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. Despite the necessity of the betrayal for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, Judas's personal responsibility and culpability are underscored.<p><b>It would be better for him if he had not been born.&#8221;</b><br>This hyperbolic statement emphasizes the gravity of Judas's actions and the severe consequences of his betrayal. It reflects the ultimate tragedy of rejecting and betraying the Messiah, leading to eternal separation from God. The phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the eternal implications of one's choices. In the broader biblical context, it serves as a warning to all about the consequences of turning away from God's will and the importance of faithfulness to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>This title refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_betrayer.htm">The Betrayer</a></b><br>This refers to Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, who would betray Jesus to the religious authorities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_betrayal.htm">The Event of Betrayal</a></b><br>This is the act of Judas handing Jesus over to the chief priests and scribes, leading to His arrest and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Despite the betrayal, God's plan for redemption through Jesus was not thwarted.

Existence is no blessing, but a curse, to him who consciously and wilfully defeats the purpose of his existence. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25</a>) here introduces Judas as asking the question, "Is it I, Rabbi?" And our Lord answers him affirmatively, "Thou hast said." This was probably said in a low voice. Had it been said so as to be heard by others, such as Peter and John, they might have risen at once to inflict summary vengeance upon the apostate traitor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
