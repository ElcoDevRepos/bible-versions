In the Old Testament, Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai, and Elijah encountered God on Mount Horeb. Jesus going up on the mountain signifies a place of significant spiritual activity and revelation. It sets the stage for the calling of the apostles, paralleling Moses' role as a leader and lawgiver. This act also foreshadows the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus delivers key teachings.<p><b>and called for those He wanted</b><br>The calling of the disciples is an act of divine sovereignty and choice. Jesus selects those He desires, emphasizing His authority and the personal nature of His call. This reflects the biblical theme of God's election, seen in the calling of Abraham and the choosing of Israel as His people. The disciples' selection is not based on merit but on Jesus' purpose and plan, highlighting grace and divine initiative.<p><b>and they came to Him</b><br>The response of the disciples is immediate and obedient, illustrating the proper response to Jesus' call. This mirrors the call of the prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who responded to God's call with readiness. The disciples' coming to Jesus signifies their willingness to leave behind their former lives and follow Him, a theme echoed in the call to discipleship throughout the Gospels. This act of coming to Jesus is a model for Christian conversion and commitment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is calling His disciples in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>A place often associated with divine revelation and significant events in the Bible, symbolizing a place of prayer and communion with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Those whom Jesus called to follow Him, representing the beginning of His chosen apostles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_initiative.htm">Divine Initiative</a></b><br>Jesus takes the initiative to call His disciples, highlighting that our relationship with Him begins with His call, not our own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purposeful_selection.htm">Purposeful Selection</a></b><br>Jesus calls those He "wanted," indicating that His selection is intentional and purposeful.

By choosing this setting, the Lord signals that something weighty and covenantal is about to unfold.<p>- <a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a> clarifies that before selecting the Twelve, Jesus &#8220;went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God,&#8221; underscoring dependence on the Father.<p>- The verse begins with &#8220;Then,&#8221; reminding us that divine calling fits into a larger, orderly plan. Christ&#8217;s movements are never random; they advance the redemption storyline (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And called for those He wanted</b><p>- &#8220;...and called for those He wanted...&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13</a>) highlights Jesus&#8217; sovereign initiative&#8212;He takes the first step.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a> affirms this: &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a> speaks of God&#8217;s foreknowledge and calling, showing that divine choice precedes human response.<p>- The phrase &#8220;those He wanted&#8221; shows personal desire, not mere duty. He delights in drawing people to Himself (<a href="/zephaniah/3-17.htm">Zephaniah 3:17</a>).<p>- By calling specific men, Jesus establishes the pattern of discipleship: He summons, we follow. <a href="/mark/1-17.htm">Mark 1:17</a> captures the same voice, &#8220;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.&#8221;<p>- His call is effectual&#8212;what He purposes, He accomplishes (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they came to Him</b><p>- &#8220;...and they came to Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13</a>) records the immediate, obedient response.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/4-20.htm">Matthew 4:20</a> notes how Peter and Andrew &#8220;immediately left their nets and followed Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a> promises, &#8220;Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me.&#8221; The disciples&#8217; arrival embodies that certainty.<p>- Their coming is voluntary yet empowered.

Jesus ascends a mountain, underscoring divine revelation; He summons those He personally desires, revealing His authority and affection; they respond by coming, exemplifying true discipleship. The verse assures believers that the Lord still initiates, calls, and draws His own, and our fitting response is swift, trusting obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And he goeth up into a mountain.</span>--The sequence of events in St. Mark varies much, it will be seen, from St. Matthew, and comes nearer to that in St. Luke. What follows is, like the parallel narrative of <a href="/context/luke/6-12.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.">Luke 6:12-13</a>, the selection rather than the mission of the Twelve, the latter appearing in Matthew 10. In St. Luke we find the noticeable fact that the night had been spent in prayer, apparently, as usual, alone, and that when it was day He called the company of the disciples, who had waited below, and made choice of the Twelve.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span>; literally, <span class="accented">into the mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). Similarly, St. Luke (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12</a>) says," He went out into the mountain to pray." The use of the definite article might either point to some well-known eminence, or to the high table-land as distinguished from the plain, and in which there would be many recesses, which would explain the use of the preposition Tradition indicates Mount Hatten as the place, about five miles to the west of the Sea of Galilee. The summit rises above a level space, where large numbers might stand within hearing. It is supposed, with good reason, that it was from thence that the sermon on the mount was delivered.
