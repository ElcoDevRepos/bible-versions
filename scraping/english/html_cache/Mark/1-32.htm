The Jewish day begins at sunset, marking the end of the Sabbath. This indicates that the people waited until the Sabbath was over to bring the sick to Jesus, adhering to the Jewish law that restricted work on the Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). This reflects the cultural and religious observance of the time.<p><b>after sunset</b><br>The mention of sunset highlights the transition from the Sabbath to the first day of the week. It was a time when people were free to travel and carry burdens, which they could not do during the Sabbath. This detail underscores the urgency and eagerness of the people to seek Jesus' healing power as soon as it was permissible.<p><b>people brought to Jesus</b><br>The act of bringing the sick to Jesus demonstrates the faith and hope the people had in His ability to heal. It also shows the communal nature of the society, where family and friends took responsibility for the well-being of others. This reflects the growing reputation of Jesus as a healer and miracle worker, as seen in earlier verses and other Gospel accounts (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>).<p><b>all the sick and demon-possessed</b><br>This phrase indicates the wide range of afflictions that Jesus was known to heal, encompassing both physical illnesses and spiritual oppression. The distinction between the sick and demon-possessed reflects the understanding of different types of suffering in the ancient world. The mention of demon possession highlights the spiritual authority of Jesus, as He often cast out demons, demonstrating His power over evil forces (<a href="/mark/1-34.htm">Mark 1:34</a>).
