Jesus often taught large crowds, as seen earlier in <a href="/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>, where He shared parables by the sea. The dismissal of the crowd suggests a shift from public ministry to a more intimate interaction with His disciples. This pattern of teaching and then withdrawing is seen throughout the Gospels, emphasizing the importance of both public proclamation and private instruction.<p><b>they took Jesus with them</b><br>The disciples taking Jesus with them highlights their role as His close followers and companions. This action signifies their commitment to Jesus and their willingness to be led by Him. It also reflects the trust and authority Jesus had among His disciples. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to take Jesus with them in all aspects of life, acknowledging His presence and guidance.<p><b>since He was already in the boat</b><br>Jesus being already in the boat suggests His readiness to move from teaching to the next phase of His ministry. The boat serves as a practical means of transportation and a symbol of the journey of faith. In the context of <a href="/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>, the boat becomes a place of testing and revelation, as the subsequent verses describe the calming of the storm. This setting underscores Jesus' authority over nature and His divine power.<p><b>And there were other boats with Him</b><br>The presence of other boats indicates that Jesus' ministry attracted not only His immediate disciples but also other followers and onlookers. This detail suggests a broader interest in Jesus' teachings and miracles. The mention of other boats also sets the stage for the miracle that follows, emphasizing that the calming of the storm was witnessed by many, further validating Jesus' divine authority and the impact of His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, who is being taken along by the disciples in the boat.

Here we see:<p>&#8226; Obedience in practical service&#8212;doing the ordinary tasks so Jesus&#8217; mission can continue.<p>&#8226; Trust in Christ&#8217;s timing&#8212;when He says it is time to move on, we move.<p>Cross reference: <a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1-3</a> shows another occasion when Jesus finished teaching and then shifted settings, emphasizing that ministry flows naturally from one moment to the next under His direction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they took Jesus with them</b><p>The disciples literally welcomed Jesus into their boat. Mark emphasizes physical proximity&#8212;a reminder that salvation and discipleship involve personally receiving Christ (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; They did not leave Him onshore; fellowship with Him was central.<p>&#8226; Jesus is never a mere passenger; even when He appears passive, He is Lord of the journey (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p>Cross reference: In <a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>, Jesus Himself says, &#8220;Let us cross to the other side,&#8221; underscoring that the initiative always starts with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since He was already in the boat</b><p>Earlier that day Jesus had used the vessel as a floating pulpit (<a href="/mark/4-1.htm">Mark 4:1</a>).
