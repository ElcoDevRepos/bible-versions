Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee, was known for his impulsive and often morally questionable decisions. The immediacy reflects Herod's fear of losing face in front of his guests after making a rash promise to Herodias' daughter. This aligns with the cultural importance of honor and shame in the ancient Near East, where a ruler's word was binding and public perception was crucial.<p><b>the king commanded</b><br>Although Herod Antipas is referred to as a king here, he was technically a tetrarch, a ruler of a quarter of a province. The title "king" is used informally, reflecting his authority in the region. This command shows Herod's absolute power over life and death, a power that was often abused by rulers of the time. It also highlights the political tension and moral corruption present in Herod's court.<p><b>that John&#8217;s head be brought in</b><br>John the Baptist was a significant prophetic figure, preparing the way for Jesus Christ. His beheading is a stark reminder of the cost of prophetic ministry and the opposition faced by those who speak truth to power. This act of bringing John's head on a platter was a gruesome fulfillment of Herodias' vengeful request, illustrating the depth of her animosity towards John for condemning her marriage to Herod.<p><b>He sent an executioner</b><br>The executioner, likely a member of Herod's guard, was tasked with carrying out the king's orders. This reflects the Roman influence on Herod's rule, as executioners were common in Roman judicial practices. The presence of an executioner in Herod's court underscores the harsh realities of justice and punishment during this period.<p><b>who went and beheaded him in the prison</b><br>John's imprisonment and subsequent execution took place in the fortress of Machaerus, located east of the Dead Sea. This fortress served as a prison and a place of execution, highlighting the precariousness of John's situation. The act of beheading was a common method of execution, symbolizing the silencing of John's prophetic voice. This event foreshadows the suffering and death of Jesus Christ, who also faced opposition from political and religious authorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_herod_antipas.htm">King Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The ruler of Galilee and Perea, known for his moral weaknesses and political maneuvering.

By objectifying John&#8217;s life in this way, Herod ignores <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>&#8217;s declaration of every person&#8217;s God-given dignity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sent an executioner</b><p>&#8226;

John&#8217;s death fulfills Jesus&#8217; earlier warning that prophets are not spared (<a href="/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34&#8211;35</a>) and foreshadows Christ&#8217;s own unjust execution (<a href="/mark/15-14.htm">Mark 15:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226;

Because they could not bear to hear the truth, therefore they bored through with a bodkin the tongue that had spoken the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">without delay,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
