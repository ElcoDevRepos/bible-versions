It points back to <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is the Creator of all things. The use of "beginning" underscores the original intent and design of God, highlighting the importance of understanding His purpose from the outset. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the authority of Scripture, as Jesus refers to the creation account to address contemporary issues. It suggests a return to foundational truths and principles that transcend cultural changes and human traditions.<p><b>&#8216;God made them male and female.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase is a direct reference to <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where God creates humanity in His image, distinctly as male and female. It underscores the intentionality and purpose in God's creation of gender, affirming the complementary nature of men and women. This distinction is foundational for understanding biblical teachings on marriage, family, and human relationships. The phrase also reflects the inherent value and dignity bestowed upon both genders by God. In the context of <a href="/mark/10.htm">Mark 10</a>, Jesus uses this reference to affirm the sanctity and permanence of marriage, as originally designed by God. This creation ordinance is seen as a type of the relationship between Christ and the Church, as elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>, where the union of male and female in marriage reflects the spiritual union between Christ and His bride.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and His disciples, teaching about the sanctity of marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Israel known for their strict adherence to the Law.
