In the context of <a href="/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>, Jesus had just demonstrated His authority over nature by cursing the fig tree and cleansing the temple. The "therefore" connects this teaching on prayer to His demonstration of divine authority and power. It emphasizes the importance of faith and the authority of Jesus' words.<p><b>whatever you ask for in prayer,</b><br>This phrase underscores the broad scope of prayer. The term "whatever" suggests that there are no limits to what can be brought before God in prayer. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, prayer was a central part of religious life, often involving set times and specific rituals. Jesus, however, emphasizes a personal and direct approach to God. This teaching aligns with other scriptures, such as <a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>, where Jesus promises that whatever is asked in His name will be done.<p><b>believe that you have received it,</b><br>Here, the focus is on the necessity of faith in prayer. The Greek verb used for "believe" implies a continuous action, suggesting that faith should be an ongoing state of trust in God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. The idea of having already received what is asked for reflects a deep trust in God's promises and His timing.<p><b>and it will be yours.</b><br>This promise assures believers of the effectiveness of faith-filled prayer. The certainty of "it will be yours" highlights the reliability of God's response to genuine faith. This assurance is consistent with the teachings found in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-8</a>, where Jesus encourages persistent prayer with the promise that those who ask will receive. Theologically, this reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and His willingness to act on behalf of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the power of faith and prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to follow His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus is teaching, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>The location near Jerusalem where Jesus often taught His disciples, including the context of this passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, central to the teaching of this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_a_foundation.htm">Faith as a Foundation</a></b><br>True prayer requires faith.

It is obvious that, as a rule, such words imply prayer for spiritual rather than temporal blessings. In that region the subjective faith becomes an objective reality. We are to believe, not that we shall one day have what we pray for in a future more or less distant, but that we actually receive it as we pray. In most, if not in all cases, in prayer for peace, pardon, illumination, the promise, though it sounds hyperbolical, is psychologically true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them; and ye shall have them</span>.
