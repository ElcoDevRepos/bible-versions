The first day of the week is Sunday, following the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday). This timing is crucial as it marks the day of Jesus' resurrection, aligning with the prophecy of rising on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). The early morning setting underscores the women's devotion and eagerness to attend to Jesus' body, reflecting the cultural practice of visiting tombs early to avoid the heat of the day.<p><b>just after sunrise</b><br>The mention of sunrise symbolizes new beginnings and hope, fitting for the resurrection narrative. In biblical symbolism, light often represents life and divine presence (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). The timing also suggests the women's urgency and dedication, as they set out at the earliest possible moment to perform their duties. This detail highlights the transition from darkness to light, both literally and metaphorically, as the resurrection brings spiritual illumination.<p><b>they went to the tomb</b><br>The women, identified in earlier verses as Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, demonstrate their loyalty and courage by visiting the tomb. This act is significant given the potential danger and the Roman guard's presence. The tomb, likely a rock-cut structure typical of Jewish burial practices of the time, serves as a focal point for the resurrection event. The women's journey to the tomb fulfills their role as the first witnesses to the resurrection, a pivotal moment in Christian faith. Their actions connect to the broader biblical theme of faithful women playing crucial roles in God's redemptive plan, as seen with figures like Ruth and Esther.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>The verse refers to the women who followed Jesus, specifically Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, as mentioned in the preceding verses.
