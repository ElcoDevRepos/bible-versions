The return signifies a transition from a moment of divine revelation back to the challenges of earthly ministry. The other disciples had been left behind, likely feeling the absence of Jesus' direct guidance.<p><b>they saw a large crowd around them</b><br>Crowds frequently gathered around Jesus and His disciples, drawn by His teachings and miracles.

In the Gospels, crowds can symbolize both the potential for faith and the challenges of misunderstanding or opposition.<p><b>and scribes arguing with them</b><br>The scribes were experts in Jewish law and often opposed Jesus, challenging His authority and teachings. Their presence here suggests a confrontation or debate, likely over theological or legal matters.

This would seem to confirm the supposition that the transfiguration took place in the night. All the synoptists agree in placing the following immediately after the transfiguration. Scribes were questioning with the disciples who had bee left behind. As they had assembled in the neigh-where Jesus was, for the purpose of watching him. Their object in questioning with the disciples was doubtless to throw discredit upon Jesus, because they, disciples, had failed to work the miracle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they returned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(elthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
