In the Old Testament, a cloud led the Israelites by day during their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The cloud here on the Mount of Transfiguration symbolizes divine presence and approval. The enveloping nature of the cloud suggests God's intimate involvement and protection, reminiscent of the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>).<p><b>and a voice came from the cloud</b><br>The voice from the cloud is a direct communication from God, similar to the voice heard at Jesus' baptism (<a href="/mark/1-11.htm">Mark 1:11</a>). This divine voice underscores the authority and identity of Jesus, affirming His mission and divinity. In Jewish tradition, a heavenly voice, or "bat kol," was considered a rare and significant event, indicating God's direct intervention or message.<p><b>&#8220;This is My beloved Son.</b><br>The declaration "This is My beloved Son" echoes <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, a messianic psalm that speaks of the anointed king. This phrase confirms Jesus' unique relationship with the Father, affirming His divine sonship and messianic role. The term "beloved" emphasizes the deep love and approval of the Father, distinguishing Jesus from all others.<p><b>Listen to Him!&#8221;</b><br>The command to "Listen to Him" highlights Jesus as the ultimate prophet and teacher, surpassing Moses and Elijah, who were also present at the Transfiguration. This directive recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a prophet like him whom the people must listen to.

The cloud enfolded them all, so that they could not be seen, it was so ample and dense, and yet so bright and shining. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>) says it was "a ought cloud. The cloud was a symbol of the grandeur and unapproachable glory of God. The disciples were admitted within this cloud that they might have a foretaste of future glory, and that they might be witnesses of what took place under the cloud, and especially that they might be able to give evidence throughout all ages of the voice which they heard come out of the cloud from "the excellent glory" (the expression is equivalent to the Hebrew "Shechinah," and St. Peter says (<a href="/2_peter/1-18.htm">2 Peter 1:18</a>), it came from heaven), <span class="cmt_word">This is my beloved Son: hear ye him</span>. But at the same time that this cloud was the symbol, it was also the veil of Deity, of the glory of Deity. "He maketh the clouds his chariot," says the psalmist (<a href="/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). Moreover, the cloud abated and subdued the splendor of Christ's appearance, which otherwise the mortal eyes of the disciples could not have borne. It will be observed that St. Mark omits the words, found in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>)," in whom I am well pleased." So does St. Luke. But it is remarkable that they are found in St. Peter (<a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>); from whence we might have expected to find them here. In St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-35.htm">Luke 9:35</a>) the most approved readings give, "This is my Son, my chosen (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The words, "my beloved Son," are impressed upon us in order that epithets so sweet and endearing might kindle our love and devotion. "Hear ye him" - not Moses, who has now departed, but Christ himself, the new Author of a new Law. "Hear ye him" was not said when our Lord was baptized, because he was then only just proclaimed to the world. But now these words signify the abolition of the old dispensation, and the establishment of the new covenant in Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a cloud</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#949;&#966;&#941;&#955;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(nephel&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3507.htm">Strong's 3507: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cloud.
