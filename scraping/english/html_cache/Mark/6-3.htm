In Jewish culture, carpentry was a respected trade, but it was not associated with religious or scholarly prestige. This reflects the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, which speaks of the Messiah having no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him. Jesus' role as a carpenter also symbolizes His creative power and His ability to build and restore, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>the son of Mary</b><br>Referring to Jesus as the "son of Mary" is unusual in Jewish tradition, where individuals were typically identified by their father's name. This could imply the townspeople's skepticism about Jesus' paternity, possibly alluding to the circumstances of His virgin birth. This phrase also emphasizes His humanity and connection to His earthly family, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah being born of a woman (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>).<p><b>and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon?</b><br>This mention of Jesus' brothers provides insight into His family life. James later became a leader in the Jerusalem church and authored the Epistle of James. The presence of His brothers indicates that Jesus grew up in a typical Jewish family setting. This familial connection is significant in understanding the initial skepticism and later belief of His family members, as seen in <a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a> and <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>.<p><b>Aren&#8217;t His sisters here with us as well?&#8221;</b><br>The mention of Jesus' sisters further emphasizes His integration into a normal family structure. This challenges any notion of Jesus being isolated or detached from ordinary human experiences. The presence of His sisters in the community suggests that His family was well-known and integrated into the local society, which may have contributed to the townspeople's familiarity and subsequent offense.<p><b>And they took offense at Him.</b><br>The offense taken by the townspeople reflects a common theme in the Gospels: the rejection of Jesus by those who knew Him best. This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men. Their offense is rooted in their inability to reconcile Jesus' ordinary background with His extraordinary claims and works. This reaction serves as a warning against the danger of familiarity breeding contempt and the challenge of recognizing divine authority in humble circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Referred to as "the carpenter," highlighting His humble beginnings and human occupation before His public ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>Jesus' mother, emphasizing His human lineage and connection to His earthly family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/james,_joses,_judas,_and_simon.htm">James, Joses, Judas, and Simon</a></b><br>Jesus' brothers, indicating His familial ties and the skepticism of those who knew Him personally.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisters.htm">Sisters</a></b><br>Mentioned to show Jesus' extended family, reinforcing His humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>The hometown of Jesus, where familiarity bred contempt and disbelief among the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humility_of_christ.htm">The Humility of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' identity as a carpenter reminds us of His humility and willingness to live an ordinary life.

Their reaction fulfills prophecy and illustrates a timeless warning: proximity to truth is no substitute for faith in the Truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Is not this the carpenter</span>?--St. Mark's is the only Gospel which gives this name as applied to our Lord Himself. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?">Matthew 13:55</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not this</span> <span class="cmt_word">the carpenter?</span> St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>) says, "the carpenter's son." We infer from this that our Lord actually worked at the trade of a carpenter, and probably continued to do so until he entered upon his public ministry. We may also infer that Joseph was now no longer living, otherwise it would have been natural for his name to have been mentioned here. According to St. Chrysostom, our Lord made ploughs and yokes for oxen. Certain]y, he often drew his similitudes from these things. "No man putting his hand to the <span class="accented">plough</span>, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (<a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>). "Take my <span class="accented">yoke</span> upon you, and learn of me "(<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>). Christ was the son of a carpenter. Yes; but he was also the Son of him who made the world at his will. Yea, he himself made the world. "All things were made by him," the Eternal Word. And he made them for us, that we might judge of the Maker by the greatness of his work. He chose to be the son of a carpenter. If he had chosen to be the sou of an emperor, then men might have ascribed his influence to the circumstances of his birth. But he chose a humble and obscure condition, for this, among other reasons, that it might be acknowledged that it was his divinity that transformed the world. Is not this the carpenter, the son of <span class="cmt_word">Mary</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon?</span> Some have thought that these were literally brethren of our Lord, sons of Joseph and Mary. Others have considered that they were his legal half-brothers, sons of Joseph by a former marriage. This view is held by many of the Greek Fathers, and has something to recommend it. But, on the whole, the most probable opinion is that they were cousins of our Lord - sons of a sister of the Virgin Mary, also called Mary, the wife of Cleophas, Clopas, or Alpheeus. There is evidence that there were four sons of Clopas and Mary, whose names were James, and Joses, and Simon (or Symeon), and Judas. Mary the wife of Clopas is mentioned by St. Matthew (Matthew 27:56) as the mother of James the less and of Joses. Jude describes himself (<a href="/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>) as the brother of James; and Simon, or Symeon, is mentioned in Eusebius as the son of Clopas. It must be remembered also that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew word which it expresses, means not only "a brother," but generally "a near kinsman." In the same way the "sisters" would be cousins of our Lord. According to a tradition recorded by Nicephorus (2:3), the names of these sisters or cousins were Esther and Tamar. <span class="cmt_word">And they were offended in him</span>. They took it ill that one brought up amongst them as a car<span class="accented">penter</span> should set himself up as a prophet and a teacher; just as there are those in every age who are apt to take it amiss if they see any one spring from a trade into the doctor's chair. But these Nazarencs <span class="accented">knew</span> not that Jesus was the Son of God, who of his great love for man vouchsafed to take a low estate, that he might redeem us, and teach us humility by his example. And thus this humility and love of Christ, which ought to have excited their admiration and respect, was a stumbling-block to them, because they could not receive it, or believe that God was willing thus to humble himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Isn&#8217;t</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
