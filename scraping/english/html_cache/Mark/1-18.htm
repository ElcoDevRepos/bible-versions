This phrase underscores the decisive nature of true discipleship, which requires prompt obedience. In the cultural context of the time, leaving one's occupation without hesitation was a significant act, indicating the compelling nature of Jesus' presence and message. This immediate response is a recurring theme in Mark's Gospel, emphasizing action and the breaking in of God's kingdom.<p><b>they left their nets</b><br>The nets symbolize the disciples' livelihood and former way of life. By leaving their nets, Simon and Andrew demonstrate a willingness to abandon their previous identities and securities to embrace a new mission. This act of leaving behind their profession as fishermen is symbolic of the call to leave behind worldly attachments to follow Christ. In a broader biblical context, this mirrors the call of Elisha, who left his oxen to follow Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>), signifying a complete commitment to God's call.<p><b>and followed Him</b><br>Following Jesus implies a radical reorientation of life. In the first-century Jewish context, discipleship involved not just learning from a teacher but also living in close relationship with them, adopting their way of life. This phrase indicates a personal commitment to Jesus, aligning with the broader biblical theme of following God&#8217;s chosen leaders, as seen with figures like Moses and Joshua. The act of following Jesus is a precursor to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where the disciples are later sent to make followers of all nations. This following is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a transformation and alignment with Jesus' mission and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter_and_andrew.htm">Simon Peter and Andrew</a></b><br>These two brothers were fishermen by trade.
