The immediate awareness signifies His omniscience, a characteristic of His divine nature. The "power" mentioned here refers to the healing virtue that emanated from Him, indicating His role as the source of divine healing. This event occurs within the context of Jesus' ministry, where He performed numerous miracles, demonstrating His authority over sickness and affirming His identity as the Messiah. The concept of power going out from Him also connects to the Old Testament understanding of God as the ultimate healer (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>). This moment underscores the personal nature of Jesus' miracles, as He is not merely a conduit but actively involved in the healing process.<p><b>Turning to the crowd,</b><br>Jesus' action of turning to the crowd signifies His intention to address the situation publicly. This reflects His teaching method, often using real-life events to impart spiritual truths. The crowd, a common element in Jesus' ministry, represents the diverse group of people drawn to Him, including those seeking healing, teaching, and those curious about His identity. This setting emphasizes the communal aspect of His ministry, where personal encounters often had broader implications for the community. The act of turning also suggests His readiness to engage with individuals, highlighting His accessibility and willingness to connect with those around Him.<p><b>He asked, &#8220;Who touched My garments?&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' question is not due to ignorance but serves a purpose in drawing out the woman who touched Him. This question invites the woman to step forward, allowing her to publicly testify to her healing and faith. It also serves to teach the crowd about the nature of faith and the personal relationship one can have with Jesus. The act of touching His garments reflects the cultural belief in the power of physical contact with holy persons or objects, a common practice in the ancient Near East. This moment parallels other instances in the Gospels where Jesus uses questions to provoke thought and reveal deeper truths (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-16</a>). The question also highlights the importance of acknowledging Jesus' role in the miracle, giving glory to God and reinforcing the idea that faith in Him is the key to receiving His blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is depicted as having divine power that can heal.

Many brushed against Him, but one touched with expectation (<a href="/matthew/14-36.htm">Matthew 14:36</a>).<p>- In <a href="/acts/19-11.htm">Acts 19:11-12</a>, even handkerchiefs carried healing power when associated with Paul&#8212;evidence that God honors tangible expressions of faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a> reveals a Savior who instantly perceives faith, whose power flows without depletion, who pauses amid urgency to celebrate a quiet believer, and who draws that believer into open confession.
