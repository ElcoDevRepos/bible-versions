The sight of Jesus walking on water was unexpected and defied natural laws, causing fear. In Jewish culture, the sea often symbolized chaos and danger, and seeing a figure on the water could have been perceived as a ghost or omen. This reaction is consistent with human nature when confronted with the supernatural. The disciples' fear highlights their lack of understanding of Jesus' divine nature, despite witnessing previous miracles.<p><b>But Jesus spoke up at once:</b><br>Jesus' immediate response demonstrates His awareness and concern for the disciples' fear. His prompt action reflects His role as a protector and shepherd, always ready to comfort and guide His followers. This moment underscores the personal relationship Jesus maintains with His disciples, emphasizing His accessibility and readiness to intervene in times of distress.<p><b>&#8220;Take courage!</b><br>This command is a call to faith and trust. Throughout Scripture, God often encourages His people to be courageous in the face of fear (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Jesus' words here are a reassurance of His presence and power, inviting the disciples to shift their focus from their fear to faith in Him. Courage in the biblical sense is not the absence of fear but the presence of trust in God's sovereignty.<p><b>It is I.</b><br>The phrase "It is I" can be translated from the Greek "ego eimi," which is significant as it echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM." This subtle yet profound declaration of Jesus' identity as God incarnate reassures the disciples of His divine authority and presence. It connects to other instances in the Gospels where Jesus uses "I AM" statements to reveal His nature and mission.<p><b>Do not be afraid.&#8221;</b><br>This command is a recurring theme in the Bible, often spoken by God or His messengers to His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's control over all circumstances and His ability to bring peace amidst chaos. Jesus' words here are not just a comfort but a directive to live in the assurance of His power and love, which casts out fear (1 <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>). This moment foreshadows the peace Jesus offers through His death and resurrection, ultimately conquering fear and death itself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is walking on water towards His disciples.

When Jesus came walking on the water, they &#8220;all saw Him and were terrified&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Terror was the natural human response to the supernatural. Similar reactions appear when Gideon meets the Angel of the LORD (<a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22&#8211;23</a>) and when the shepherds see the heavenly host (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their fear also reveals how limited their understanding of Jesus still was, even after seeing the feeding of the five thousand earlier that day (<a href="/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment underscores our own tendency to panic when circumstances overpower our senses, forgetting that Christ is sovereign over creation (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Jesus spoke up at once</b><p>Jesus did not leave His followers in their terror even for a moment.<p>&#8226; The immediacy of His response mirrors how quickly He stretched out His hand to save Peter when Peter began to sink (<a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God answering His people &#8220;at once&#8221; when they cry out (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6&#8211;7</a>). His timely intervention encourages believers to expect His help in real trouble (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take courage!</b><p>This is both a command and an invitation.<p>&#8226; Courage is possible only because Jesus is present.

The same eternal Lord who spoke from the burning bush now stands on Galilee&#8217;s waves.<p>&#8226; By declaring His presence, Jesus assures them they are not seeing a ghost (<a href="/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26&#8211;27</a>) but their living Master, fully God and fully man, ruling the elements.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not be afraid.</b><p>The final command seals the lesson.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God tells His people not to fear because He is with them (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear flees when faith focuses on Christ&#8217;s nearness, power, and love (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). The disciples&#8217; storm mirrors every believer&#8217;s trial: Jesus stands above it, calls by name, and walks us safely through (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-50.htm">Mark 6:50</a> reveals Jesus meeting His followers in their panic, commanding courage rooted in His divine presence, and banishing fear.
