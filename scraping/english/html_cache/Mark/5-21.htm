The "other side" refers to the western shore, likely near Capernaum, a central hub for His ministry. This movement highlights Jesus' intentional outreach to various communities, emphasizing His mission to reach both Jewish and Gentile populations. The Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake, was a significant geographical feature in the region, facilitating travel and trade. Jesus' use of a boat underscores His connection with the local fishermen, some of whom were His disciples.<p><b>a large crowd gathered around Him</b><br>The gathering of a large crowd reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the widespread interest in His teachings and miracles. This crowd likely consisted of people from various backgrounds, including Jews and possibly Gentiles, drawn by His reputation as a healer and teacher. The presence of such crowds often set the stage for significant teachings and miracles, demonstrating the public's hunger for spiritual truth and physical healing. This also foreshadows the challenges Jesus would face from religious leaders who felt threatened by His influence.<p><b>beside the sea</b><br>The setting "beside the sea" is significant as it often served as a natural amphitheater for Jesus' teachings, allowing His voice to carry over the water to the gathered crowds. The Sea of Galilee was a familiar and accessible location for many in the region, making it an ideal place for Jesus to reach a diverse audience. This setting also connects to various Old Testament prophecies and narratives where bodies of water play a crucial role, such as the parting of the Red Sea, symbolizing deliverance and divine intervention. The sea's proximity underscores the theme of Jesus as the Lord over creation, as seen in His calming of the storm and walking on water.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea_of_galilee.htm">The Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A significant body of water in Jesus' ministry, where He often traveled and taught.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_large_crowd.htm">The Large Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the people who were drawn to Jesus, seeking healing, teaching, and miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>A means of transportation for Jesus and His disciples, symbolizing His movement and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_side.htm">The Other Side</a></b><br>Refers to the region across the Sea of Galilee, indicating Jesus' outreach beyond Jewish territories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_accessibility.htm">Jesus' Accessibility</a></b><br>Jesus made Himself available to the people, crossing boundaries to reach those in need.

St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>) distinctly tells us that he had left Nazareth, and was now dwelling at Capernaum, thus fulfilling the ancient prophecy with regard to Zebulun and Nephthalim. The circumstances under which he quitted Nazareth are given by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-31</a>). St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>) calls Capernaum his own city. Thus as Christ ennobled Bethlehem by his birth, Nazareth by his education, and Jerusalem By his death, so he honored Capernaum by making it his ordinary residence, and the focus, so to speak, of his preaching and miracles. When Jesus returned, <span class="cmt_word">a great multitude was gathered unto him; and he was by the sea</span>. St. Luke says that the people welcomed him, for they were waiting for him. Again he placed himself by the sea, probably for the conveniences of addressing a multitude, and of relieving himself of the pressure, as before, by taking refuge in a boat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had again crossed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#940;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(diaperasantos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1276.htm">Strong's 1276: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cross over, pass over.
