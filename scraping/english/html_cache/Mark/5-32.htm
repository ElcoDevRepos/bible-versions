Despite the pressing crowd, He is not distracted or hurried. This reflects His divine omniscience and personal care for individuals. The act of looking around signifies His desire to identify and connect with the person who touched Him, highlighting His personal engagement with those who seek Him. This moment is reminiscent of God's pursuit of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, where God seeks out individuals for relationship and accountability.<p><b>to see who had done this.</b><br>Jesus' inquiry is not out of ignorance but to bring the woman forward for a public acknowledgment of her faith. This act of seeking out the woman who touched His garment and was healed (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>) serves to affirm her faith and restore her socially and religiously, as her condition would have made her ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>). By addressing her publicly, Jesus not only confirms her healing but also reintegrates her into the community. This moment foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Gospel, where Jesus breaks down barriers and restores individuals to wholeness, as seen in His interactions with other marginalized individuals throughout the Gospels.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is actively seeking the person who touched His garment, demonstrating His awareness and personal concern for individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>Although not named in this verse, she is the one who touched Jesus' garment in faith, believing she would be healed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people surrounding Jesus, making it difficult to identify who touched Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The likely setting of this event, a town where Jesus performed many miracles and taught extensively.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>The miraculous healing of the woman who had been suffering for twelve years, which occurs just before this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_personal_concern.htm">Jesus' Personal Concern</a></b><br>Jesus' search for the woman shows His personal concern for each individual.

He scans the faces until He locks onto the one who reached out in faith.<p>&#8226; The Savior&#8217;s determination underscores that personal encounters matter to Him, not just anonymous power transfers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see</b><p>The goal is visibility and relationship.

His purpose is relational: to bring her into the open, confirm her faith, and grant full restoration. The verse assures us that the Savior who notices one trembling believer in a throng still seeks personal, public acknowledgment of faith today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">He looked round about.</span>--The tense of the Greek verb implies a continued looking.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He looked round about</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) - another favourite word of St. Mark. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/5-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He kept looking around</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#949;&#946;&#955;&#941;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(perieblepeto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4017.htm">Strong's 4017: </a> </span><span class="str2">To look around on, survey.
