They were responsible for copying, interpreting, and teaching the Scriptures. Their presence in this scene highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities. The scribes were often skeptical of Jesus' teachings and actions, as they perceived Him as a threat to their authority and traditions.<p><b>were sitting there</b><br>This phrase indicates that the scribes were present during Jesus' teaching, likely in a house in Capernaum. Sitting was a common posture for teachers and learners in Jewish culture, suggesting they were there to observe and evaluate Jesus' words and actions. Their presence signifies the growing interest and scrutiny Jesus faced from religious leaders.<p><b>and thinking in their hearts</b><br>This phrase reveals the internal thoughts and attitudes of the scribes, which were often critical and judgmental. In biblical terms, the "heart" refers to the center of one's thoughts, emotions, and will. The scribes' internal questioning reflects their skepticism and inability to accept Jesus' authority. This internal dialogue is significant as it sets the stage for Jesus' demonstration of His divine insight and authority, as He perceives their thoughts and addresses them directly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>- Jewish religious leaders and experts in the Law, often depicted as opponents of Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>- A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles and taught in the synagogue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/paralytic_man.htm">Paralytic Man</a></b><br>- The individual whose healing by Jesus prompted the scribes' internal questioning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>- The setting of this event, likely a private home in Capernaum where Jesus was teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_heart.htm">Understanding the Heart</a></b><br>Jesus perceives the thoughts of the scribes, reminding us that God knows our innermost thoughts and intentions.

And if he had been a mere man; if he had not really been, as he assumed to be, Divine, the only begotten Son of the Father, - then no doubt they would have been right in supposing that he blasphemed. But their error was that they could not perceive in him the glory of the only begotten Son.
