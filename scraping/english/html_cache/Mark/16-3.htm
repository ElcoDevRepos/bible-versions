It reflects their concern and uncertainty about how they would access the tomb. The women mentioned earlier in the chapter include Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome. Their discussion shows their dedication and love for Jesus, as they were willing to face potential obstacles to anoint His body with spices, a customary practice of the time for honoring the deceased.<p><b>&#8220;Who will roll away the stone</b><br>The stone mentioned here was a large, circular rock used to seal the entrance of the tomb. Such stones were common in Jewish burial practices of the first century and were designed to prevent animals and grave robbers from entering. The concern about moving the stone highlights the women's awareness of their physical limitations, as these stones could weigh several hundred pounds. This detail underscores the miraculous nature of the stone being rolled away, as described later in the chapter.<p><b>from the entrance of the tomb?&#8221;</b><br>The tomb was likely a rock-cut tomb, a common burial practice for wealthier individuals in Judea during this period. The entrance would have been low, requiring one to stoop to enter. The mention of the tomb's entrance emphasizes the finality of Jesus' burial and the barrier between the living and the dead. This moment foreshadows the resurrection, as the stone being rolled away signifies the opening of the tomb and the defeat of death. Theologically, it points to Jesus as the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the Messiah's victory over death, such as in <a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, which speaks of God swallowing up death forever.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>The verse refers to the women who were followers of Jesus. They were going to the tomb to anoint Jesus' body with spices. These women include Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, as mentioned in the surrounding verses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>This is the burial place of Jesus after His crucifixion. It was a new tomb, hewn out of rock, and a large stone was rolled against the entrance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>A large stone was placed at the entrance of the tomb to seal it.

Similar faith-driven steps appear when Abraham obeyed without knowing all the details (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>) and when the lepers moved toward the camp before seeing deliverance (<a href="/2_kings/7-5.htm">2 Kings 7:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is historically accurate, this simple remark underscores its eyewitness reliability; no later editor would invent women who feared an obstacle but walked on regardless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who will roll away the stone&#8221;</b><p>A &#8220;large stone&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-46.htm">Mark 15:46</a>) sealed the grave; Roman guards and an official seal added human impossibility (<a href="/matthew/27-62.htm">Matthew 27:62-66</a>).<p>&#8226; The women&#8217;s question highlights their limited strength&#8212;an implied confession of need. This mirrors the psalmist&#8217;s cry, &#8220;My help comes from the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-2.htm">Psalm 121:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God often allows believers to face barriers too heavy to move so that His power becomes unmistakable. Think of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-18</a>) or the walls of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; While they worried about the stone, God had already sent an angel to roll it back (<a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). He answers before we even ask (<a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;from the entrance of the tomb?&#8221;</b><p>The sealed entrance symbolized death&#8217;s finality, but prophecy had already promised Jesus &#8220;would not see decay&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>; <a href="/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The very spot meant to confine Him became the doorway of victory: &#8220;Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; He has risen!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-5.htm">Luke 24:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Every detail&#8212;Joseph&#8217;s new tomb (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>), the location outside the city (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12-13</a>), even the stone itself&#8212;fulfilled Scripture with literal precision, assuring us that every promise God makes will likewise come to pass (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/16-3.htm">Mark 16:3</a> captures genuine followers facing a real, immovable obstacle. Their concern is recorded honestly, confirming Scripture&#8217;s reliability and pointing to our own need for divine intervention. God had already removed the barrier, turning the tomb into a testimony. When we encounter stones too heavy to roll away, this verse reminds us that the risen Lord is already at work, making a way where none seems possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And they said among themselves . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and they were saying to themselves.</span> The words were on the point of rising to their lips as they looked up and saw the stone rolled away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they were saying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">among themselves, Who shall roll us away</span> <span class="cmt_word">the stone from the door of the tomb?</span> The usual form of tombs in Palestine was the following: - There was generally an approach to the tomb open to the sky; then a low entrance on the side of the rock, leading into a square chamber, on one side of which was a recess for the body, about three feet deep, with a low arch over it. The stone here referred to by the women would be the stone which covered the actual entrance into the vault. It would probably be not less than six feet in breadth and three in height. This great stone had been rolled By Joseph to the mouth of the tomb; and then he had departed. Now, as the women approached, "they were saying (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,) among themselves, Who shall roll us away (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the stone?"
