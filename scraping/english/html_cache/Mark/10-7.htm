It emphasizes the divine intention behind the institution of marriage, rooted in the creation narrative found in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. The "reason" is God's design for human relationships, highlighting the importance of marriage as a foundational social unit.<p><b>a man will leave his father and mother</b><br>In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family ties were strong, and living in extended family units was common. Leaving one's parents signifies a significant shift in loyalty and priority, establishing a new primary family unit. This reflects the biblical principle of cleaving to one's spouse as a new, independent entity. It also underscores the importance of marriage as a covenant relationship, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>, where Paul relates marriage to the relationship between Christ and the Church.<p><b>and be united to his wife</b><br>The phrase "be united" implies a deep, intimate bond that is both physical and spiritual. This union is not merely a contract but a covenant, reflecting the Hebrew concept of "one flesh" from <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. The unity in marriage is a type of the unity between Christ and believers, as seen in the New Testament. The permanence and exclusivity of this union are emphasized, aligning with Jesus' teachings against divorce in the surrounding passages. This reflects the prophetic imagery of God&#8217;s unending commitment to His people, as seen in Hosea's marriage to Gomer, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching about marriage and divorce in response to questions from the Pharisees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Israel known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses.

That &#8220;reason&#8221; points back to God&#8217;s intentional design:<p>&#8226; God Himself established marriage in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, and Jesus reinforces that origin here.<p>&#8226; By tying His words to creation, Christ shows marriage is not cultural or temporary; it is an enduring ordinance.<p>&#8226; The statement also answers the Pharisees&#8217; question about divorce by moving the discussion from human concession (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1&#8211;4</a>) to God&#8217;s purpose (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b> a man</b><p>The focus now narrows to the individual called to embrace God&#8217;s design:<p>&#8226; &#8220;A man&#8221; indicates personal responsibility.
