The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Tiberias or Lake Gennesaret, is a freshwater lake in Israel. It is significant in Jesus' ministry, as many of His miracles and teachings occurred around its shores. The crossing follows the miraculous feeding of the 5,000 and Jesus walking on water, demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<p><b>they landed at Gennesaret</b><br>Gennesaret is a fertile plain located on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Known for its rich soil and abundant agriculture, it was a prosperous area during Jesus' time. The landing at Gennesaret signifies a transition to a new phase of ministry, where Jesus continues to heal and teach. This location is not far from Capernaum, a central hub for Jesus' Galilean ministry, indicating His strategic movement through the region.<p><b>and moored the boat</b><br>Mooring the boat suggests a temporary stop, allowing Jesus and His disciples to disembark and engage with the people in the area. This action sets the stage for the subsequent events where Jesus performs healings and miracles, showcasing His compassion and power.

Compare how Israel &#8220;crossed over&#8221; the Jordan before entering promise (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>), and how Jesus later &#8220;crossed over&#8221; after calming another storm (<a href="/mark/5-1.htm">Mark 5:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The safe arrival confirms Jesus&#8217; sovereignty over wind and wave, echoing <a href="/psalms/107-29.htm">Psalm 107:29</a>: &#8220;He calmed the storm to a whisper and the waves of the sea were hushed.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Practical takeaway: every crossing supervised by Christ ends with purpose, not mere survival (<a href="/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they landed at Gennesaret</b><p>&#8211; Gennesaret is a fertile plain on the north-west shore of the Sea of Galilee, often called &#8220;the paradise of Galilee&#8221; for its rich soil. <a href="/matthew/14-34.htm">Matthew 14:34</a> records the same landing spot, reinforcing the historical accuracy of the event.<p>&#8211; This new setting points to fresh opportunity: multitudes will soon flock to Jesus (<a href="/mark/6-54.htm">Mark 6:54-56</a>), just as earlier crowds pressed Him at Capernaum (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>).<p>&#8211; The Lord intentionally directs His followers to places of need; like Peter&#8217;s later vision that led him to Cornelius (<a href="/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23-24</a>), divine appointments await the obedient.<p>&#8211; Expectation: whenever Jesus steps into a new locale, transformation follows (<a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and moored the boat</b><p>&#8211; Mooring signals rest and readiness.
