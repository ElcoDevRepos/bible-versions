Known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and oral traditions, they often clashed with Jesus over interpretations of the law. Their approach was not one of genuine inquiry but rather an attempt to trap Jesus in a theological or legal error. This reflects a broader pattern in the Gospels where religious leaders challenge Jesus to undermine His authority (e.g., <a href="/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15-18</a>). The setting is significant as it occurs in Judea, a region under Herod Antipas, where John the Baptist had been executed for condemning Herod's unlawful marriage, adding a layer of political tension to the question.<p><b>&#8220;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?&#8221;</b><br>The question of divorce was a contentious issue among Jewish scholars. The Pharisees' inquiry likely refers to <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, which discusses the conditions under which a man may divorce his wife. At the time, there were two main rabbinical schools of thought: the school of Shammai, which allowed divorce only for serious transgressions, and the school of Hillel, which permitted it for more trivial reasons. By asking this question, the Pharisees hoped to force Jesus to take a side, potentially alienating Him from one group or the other. This question also touches on the sanctity of marriage as instituted by God in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where marriage is depicted as a divine union. Jesus' response, which follows in the subsequent verses, emphasizes the original intent of marriage as a lifelong covenant, reflecting God's design and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is approached by the Pharisees to test Him.

Herod Antipas had divorced his wife to marry Herodias; John the Baptist lost his life for condemning that union (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-18</a>). If Jesus speaks against divorce, He risks Herod&#8217;s wrath.<p>&#8211; Parallel account: &#8220;Some Pharisees came to test Him. They asked, &#8216;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>). Matthew&#8217;s wording underscores the broad, permissive view they hope Jesus will denounce.<p>&#8211; Jesus will answer by moving the conversation from what is merely &#8220;lawful&#8221; to what is divinely intended, reaffirming that marriage is God-joined and therefore not to be severed by human whim (<a href="/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they inquired</b><p>&#8211; The phrase points to a public setting; they &#8220;ask&#8221; in front of the crowd, turning a personal issue into a public test.<p>&#8211; Their inquiry is defensive, not devotional. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> invites sincere asks for wisdom; the Pharisees&#8217; ask springs from hardened hearts (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet even hostile questions become platforms for truth.

Their test aims to pit Jesus against Moses, public opinion, and political powers. Jesus will seize the moment to reveal their hard hearts and to reassert God&#8217;s original, unbreakable design for marriage. The verse reminds us that questions posed in malice can still serve God&#8217;s purpose of unveiling truth, and it invites believers to hold marriage in honor, aligning with the Creator&#8217;s intent rather than the culture&#8217;s concessions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2-12) <span class= "bld">And the Pharisees came to him.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3-12</a>. We are not surprised to find St. Mark omitting the "hard saying" about the eunuchs of <a href="/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>. It was hardly likely, even if he knew it, to commend itself to him as adapted for the Gentile readers for whom he wrote his Gospel. Probably, however, for the reason thus given, it was not part of the current teaching of the Church, and was recorded by St. Matthew as something exceptional.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came unto him Pharisees</span> - the article should be omitted - <span class="cmt_word">and asked him</span> - they came forward before the people, and publicly questioned him - <span class="cmt_word">Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?</span> St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>) adds to the question the words, "for every cause." There were causes for which it was lawful. They put this question to our Lord, <span class="cmt_word">tempting him</span>; of course with an evil intent. This question about divorce was one which was much agitated in the time of our Lord. In the century before Christ, a learned rabbi, named Hillel, a native of Babylon, who afterwards came to Jerusalem, studied the Law with great success, and became the head of the chief school in that city. One of his disciples, named Shammai, separated from his master, and set up another school; so that in the time of our Lord the scribes and doctors of the Law were ranged in two parties, namely, the followers of Hillel, the most influential; and the followers of Shammai. These two schools differed widely on the subject of divorce. The followers of Shammai only permitted divorce in the case of moral defilement, while the followers of Hillel placed the matter entirely in the power of the husband. The object, therefore, of this artful question was to entrap our Lord, and to bring him into collision with one or other of these two opposing parties. For if he had said that it was not lawful for a man to put away his wife, he would have exposed himself to the hostility of many of the wealthy classes, who put away their wives for any cause. But if he had allowed the lawfulness of divorce at all, they would have found fault with his doctrine as imperfect and carnal, although he professed to be a spiritual Teacher of a perfect system, sent down from heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Some] Pharisees</span><br /><span class="grk">&#934;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Pharisaioi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5330.htm">Strong's 5330: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; a separatist, i.e. Exclusively religious; a Pharisean, i.e. Jewish sectary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proselthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to test</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#940;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(peirazontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3985.htm">Strong's 3985: </a> </span><span class="str2">To try, tempt, test.
