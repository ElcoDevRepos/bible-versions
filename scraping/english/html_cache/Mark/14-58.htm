It reflects the legal proceedings of the time, where multiple witnesses were required to establish a charge. The statement is a misrepresentation of Jesus' words, highlighting the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders.<p><b>I will destroy this man-made temple</b><br>The "man-made temple" refers to the physical Temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and a symbol of Jewish identity. Jesus' statement is often seen as a prophetic declaration of the Temple's destruction, which occurred in AD 70. It also symbolizes the end of the old covenant and the establishment of a new covenant through Jesus.<p><b>and in three days</b><br>The reference to "three days" is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness and divine intervention. It foreshadows Jesus' resurrection, which occurred on the third day after His crucifixion, marking the fulfillment of His mission and the validation of His divine authority.<p><b>I will build another</b><br>This phrase suggests the creation of a new form of worship and relationship with God, not centered on a physical structure but on Jesus Himself. It points to the establishment of the Church, the body of believers, as the new temple where God's presence dwells.<p><b>that is made without hands</b><br>"Made without hands" indicates something divine and eternal, contrasting with the temporary and human-made Temple. It emphasizes the spiritual nature of the new covenant and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.
