This act of sitting down indicates that Jesus is about to deliver an important lesson to His disciples. It reflects a common practice in Jewish teaching where the teacher assumes a seated position to convey significant teachings.<p><b>Jesus called the Twelve</b><br>The Twelve refers to the twelve apostles, who were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and to carry on His mission. This calling together of the Twelve underscores the importance of the message He is about to share. It highlights the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples and the special role they play in His ministry. The number twelve is significant, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and indicating the foundation of a new covenant community.<p><b>and said</b><br>This phrase introduces the direct teaching of Jesus, emphasizing the authoritative nature of His words. In the Gospels, when Jesus speaks, it is often to reveal deeper truths about the Kingdom of God and to challenge existing cultural norms.<p><b>&#8220;If anyone wants to be first</b><br>The desire to be first or greatest was a common human ambition, even among the disciples, as seen in their earlier discussions about who would be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus addresses this natural human inclination by redefining what it means to be first in the context of His Kingdom. This teaching contrasts with worldly views of power and status.<p><b>he must be the last of all</b><br>Jesus introduces a radical reversal of values, where greatness is not measured by status or power but by humility and selflessness. Being "last of all" implies a willingness to put others before oneself, a concept that is countercultural both in the ancient world and today. This teaching echoes the Beatitudes, where the meek and humble are blessed.<p><b>and the servant of all.&#8221;</b><br>The call to be a servant of all is a central theme in Jesus' teachings and is exemplified in His own life and ministry. Jesus Himself is the ultimate servant, as seen in His sacrificial death on the cross. This phrase connects to other scriptural teachings on servanthood, such as <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-7</a>, where Paul describes Jesus taking the form of a servant. It also fulfills the prophetic imagery of the Suffering Servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The concept of servanthood is foundational to Christian discipleship, emphasizing love, humility, and service to others as the true path to greatness in God's Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about true greatness in the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_disciples.htm">The Twelve Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' closest followers, who are being instructed on the nature of leadership and service.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, the context of the chapter indicates that this teaching took place in a house in Capernaum, a significant location in Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_greatness_in_the_kingdom.htm">True Greatness in the Kingdom</a></b><br>Jesus redefines greatness, contrasting worldly views with Kingdom values.
