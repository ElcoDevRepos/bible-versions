It fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, "They pierced my hands and my feet." This method of execution was not only physically excruciating but also symbolically significant, as it represented the curse of the law (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). Jesus' crucifixion took place at Golgotha, outside the city walls of Jerusalem, aligning with the requirement for sin offerings to be burned outside the camp (<a href="/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11-12</a>). This event is central to Christian theology, as it represents the atoning sacrifice of Jesus, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>They also divided His garments by casting lots</b><br>This action fulfilled the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>, "They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." The Roman soldiers, who were responsible for carrying out the crucifixion, would customarily take the victim's clothing as part of their spoils. The casting of lots was a common practice in ancient times to make decisions or divide possessions, indicating the soldiers' indifference to the suffering of Jesus and their focus on material gain. This act underscores the humiliation and degradation Jesus endured, stripped of His dignity and possessions.<p><b>to decide what each of them would take.</b><br>The division of Jesus' garments among the soldiers highlights the fulfillment of Scripture and the sovereignty of God in the details of the crucifixion. Each soldier received a portion, but the seamless tunic was left to be decided by casting lots, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecy and the meticulous orchestration of events according to divine plan. This moment also serves as a stark contrast between the soldiers' earthly concerns and the spiritual significance of Jesus' sacrifice. The act of taking His garments symbolizes the stripping away of His earthly identity, yet it is through this sacrifice that believers are clothed in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being crucified in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>The individuals responsible for carrying out the crucifixion and dividing Jesus' garments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was crucified, also known as "The Place of the Skull."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucifixion.htm">Crucifixion</a></b><br>A Roman method of execution, symbolizing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus for humanity's sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/casting_lots.htm">Casting Lots</a></b><br>A method used by the soldiers to divide Jesus' garments, fulfilling Old Testament prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>The division of Jesus' garments is a direct fulfillment of prophecy, demonstrating the divine orchestration of events and the reliability of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_humiliation_of_christ.htm">The Humiliation of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' crucifixion and the casting of lots for His garments highlight His humility and the extent of His suffering for our redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Even in the midst of apparent chaos and injustice, God's sovereign plan is being fulfilled, reminding us of His control over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_redemption.htm">The Cost of Redemption</a></b><br>The crucifixion underscores the immense cost of our salvation, calling us to live lives of gratitude and obedience in response to Christ's sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_surrender.htm">The Call to Surrender</a></b><br>Just as Jesus surrendered His life, we are called to surrender our own lives to God's will, trusting in His perfect plan.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_15_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 15:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_24_and_OT_prophecy_link.htm">How does Mark 15:24 fulfill Old Testament prophecy about the Messiah's suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_cast_lots_for_Jesus_clothes.htm">What significance does the act of casting lots for Jesus' clothes hold?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Finding_comfort_in_Jesus_suffering_2.htm">How can we find comfort in Jesus' suffering as described in Mark 15:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_24_Christ_s_humility_lesson.htm">What does Mark 15:24 teach us about the humility of Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_sacrifice_daily_2.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Jesus' sacrifice in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_cast_lots_for_Jesus_clothes_2.htm">Why did the soldiers cast lots for Jesus' garments in Mark 15:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_divide_Jesus_clothes_in_Mark_15_24.htm">What is the significance of dividing Jesus' clothes in Mark 15:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Mark_15_24_s_link_to_OT_prophecy.htm">How does Mark 15:24 fulfill Old Testament prophecy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_jesus_father_any_children.htm">Did Jesus father any children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_is_psalm_22_a_prophecy_of_crucifixion.htm">Overall &#8211; How can Psalm 22 be a prophecy of Jesus&#8217; crucifixion if crucifixion was not a known form of execution at the time of the psalm&#8217;s composition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_hebrews_1_1-2_claim_god_speaks.htm">How can Hebrews 1:1&#8211;2 claim God now speaks solely through His Son when no direct historical record outside scripture confirms this revelation?

Such is the most approved reading. The evangelist states the fact without staying to dwell on the painful circumstances connected with the act of nailing him to the cross; and passes on to the mention of other things. <span class="cmt_word">They part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take</span>. The outer robe and the tunic would have been removed previously to the crucifixion. St. John (<a href="/john/21-23.htm">John 21:23</a>) here goes into details. "They took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top through.. out." <span class="accented">His garments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>).

St. Cyril refers to the clothes of criminals as the perquisite of the executioners.
