Synagogues were central to Jewish religious life, serving as places of worship, teaching, and community gathering. Jesus often taught in synagogues, as seen in <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>, where He reads from Isaiah, proclaiming the fulfillment of prophecy. His companions likely included His first disciples, emphasizing the communal aspect of His ministry.<p><b>they went with James and John</b><br>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were among the first disciples called by Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19-20</a>).

Archaeological evidence suggests Capernaum was a small fishing village on the Sea of Galilee, with a house believed to be Peter's identified by early Christian pilgrims.
