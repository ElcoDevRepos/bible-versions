The mention of "Jesus of Nazareth" identifies Jesus by His earthly origin, a common way to distinguish individuals in that time. Nazareth was a small, seemingly insignificant town, yet it fulfills the prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). This title also highlights Jesus' humble beginnings, contrasting with His divine mission.<p><b>he began to cry out</b><br>Bartimaeus's response is immediate and desperate. His cry signifies both physical and spiritual need. In the cultural context, a beggar's cry would often be ignored, yet Bartimaeus's persistence shows his faith and recognition of Jesus' authority. This act of crying out is a demonstration of faith, as he believes Jesus can heal him.<p><b>&#8220;Jesus, Son of David</b><br>By calling Jesus "Son of David," Bartimaeus acknowledges Him as the Messiah. This title is significant because it connects Jesus to the Davidic covenant, where God promised David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This messianic title is a public declaration of Jesus' royal lineage and His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>).<p><b>have mercy on me!&#8221;</b><br>The plea for mercy is a common biblical theme, reflecting a deep understanding of one's own need for divine grace. In the Jewish tradition, mercy is a key attribute of God (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). Bartimaeus's request is not just for physical healing but also for spiritual restoration. This cry for mercy is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as the Psalms, where the faithful often seek God's compassion and forgiveness (<a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>). Bartimaeus's faith and humility are evident in his appeal, setting an example for believers to approach God with a heart of repentance and trust.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bartimaeus.htm">Bartimaeus</a></b><br>A blind beggar sitting by the roadside in Jericho.

Faith often begins with hearing; &#8220;faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The crowd identified Jesus by His earthly hometown. That common label&#8212;&#8220;Jesus of Nazareth&#8221;&#8212;reminds us that the eternal Son took on a real human location and history (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Bartimaeus could not see Jesus, yet what he heard stirred immediate hope. Similar awakenings occur in <a href="/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9&#8211;10</a>, where a crippled man &#8220;listened to Paul speaking&#8221; before leaping up healed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he began to cry out</b><p>&#8226; He did not wait for ideal conditions or polite permission. Urgency marks true need; <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a> shows David doing the same: &#8220;In my distress I called upon the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verb tense signals persistence&#8212;he kept on shouting despite opposition (<a href="/mark/10-48.htm">Mark 10:48</a>). <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a> encourages us to &#8220;pray and not give up.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bold, audible faith often precedes breakthrough. <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> notes that Jesus Himself offered prayers &#8220;with loud cries and tears.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus, Son of David</b><p>&#8226; By choosing this messianic title, Bartimaeus confessed more than the crowd knew. He recognized Jesus as the promised King in David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a> opens with the same title, tying Jesus to covenant history. Mark records this confession again in 12:35&#8211;37, revealing that even the religious leaders struggled to grasp what the blind man saw by faith.<p>&#8226; Addressing Jesus this way was both worship and theology; it honored the Lord&#8217;s royal authority and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have mercy on me!</b><p>&#8226; Mercy is undeserved kindness. Bartimaeus brought no r&#233;sum&#233;, only dependence. <a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a> models this plea: &#8220;Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving devotion.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The request is singular&#8212;&#8220;on me.&#8221; God&#8217;s grace meets personal, specific need.

He recognizes Jesus both as the approachable Nazarene and the royal Son of David. The verse models how saving faith is birthed by hearing, expressed by bold petition, grounded in correct confession of Christ, and focused on God&#8217;s merciful character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">he heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
