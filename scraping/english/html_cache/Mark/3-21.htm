In the context of <a href="/mark/3.htm">Mark 3</a>, Jesus had been performing miracles, teaching with authority, and challenging the religious leaders, which would have drawn significant attention. The family likely heard reports of His actions and the controversy surrounding Him. This reflects the close-knit nature of family and community in first-century Jewish culture, where news would travel quickly through oral communication.<p><b>they went out to take custody of Him</b><br>The family's decision to "take custody" of Jesus suggests they were concerned for His well-being or reputation. In the cultural context, family honor was paramount, and any behavior perceived as erratic or dangerous could bring shame. The Greek term used here can imply a forceful intervention, indicating their serious intent to intervene in Jesus' ministry. This action reflects a misunderstanding of His mission and divine authority, a theme seen throughout the Gospels where even those closest to Jesus struggle to comprehend His true identity and purpose.<p><b>saying, &#8220;He is out of His mind.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the family's perception of Jesus' actions as irrational or extreme. In the historical context, claims of divinity or messianic identity could be seen as blasphemous or delusional, especially when accompanied by actions that defied social and religious norms. This reaction is echoed in other parts of the Gospels, where Jesus is misunderstood or rejected by those who knew Him (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). The accusation of being "out of His mind" highlights the tension between Jesus' divine mission and human expectations, a recurring theme in His ministry. This misunderstanding also foreshadows the broader rejection He would face, culminating in His crucifixion, which was part of the divine plan for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, whose teachings and miracles are causing a stir among the people and religious leaders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_family.htm">His Family</a></b><br>- Refers to Jesus' relatives who are concerned about His well-being and the impact of His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>- Jesus' family attempts to take custody of Him, believing He is out of His mind due to His radical actions and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/misunderstanding_of_jesus'_mission.htm">Misunderstanding of Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Even those closest to Jesus can misunderstand His mission.

The verse highlights the clash between natural reasoning and divine mission: loved ones may misread wholehearted obedience to God as imbalance, yet Jesus faithfully presses on. Believers today can expect similar misunderstanding, but the passage reassures us that steadfast commitment, not human approval, fulfills the Father&#8217;s will&#8212;and in time, even skeptics can become supporters when they encounter the risen Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And when his friends</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">those from Him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from His home.
