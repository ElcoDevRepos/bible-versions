In the biblical context, betrayal within families is a sign of the end times, as prophesied by Jesus. This echoes <a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, where familial discord is a sign of societal breakdown. Historically, such betrayals were not uncommon in times of religious persecution, such as during the early Christian era under Roman rule. The phrase underscores the cost of discipleship and the potential for conflict even among close kin.<p><b>and a father his child</b><br>The mention of a father betraying his child emphasizes the depth of division and the breaking of natural familial bonds. In the cultural context of the time, family loyalty was paramount, making such betrayal particularly shocking. This reflects the severe trials believers would face, where allegiance to Christ could lead to alienation from one's own family. It also serves as a warning of the spiritual warfare that can disrupt even the most fundamental human relationships.<p><b>Children will rise against their parents</b><br>This phrase indicates a reversal of the expected order, where children, who are typically under the authority of their parents, will turn against them. This rebellion is indicative of the moral and social upheaval that characterizes the end times. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-2</a>, where disobedience to parents is listed among the signs of the last days. The phrase serves as a reminder of the potential cost of following Christ, which may include division within one's own household.<p><b>and have them put to death</b><br>The ultimate consequence of these betrayals is death, highlighting the severity of the persecution believers may face. This reflects the historical reality for many early Christians who were martyred for their faith, often as a result of being reported by those close to them. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the spiritual battle between the kingdom of God and the forces of evil. The phrase calls believers to steadfastness and faithfulness, even in the face of life-threatening opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is addressing His disciples about the signs of the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' discourse, representing all believers who would face persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>The individuals mentioned in the prophecy, highlighting the breakdown of familial relationships during times of persecution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/end_times.htm">End Times</a></b><br>The period Jesus is describing, characterized by turmoil and betrayal, leading up to His second coming.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The event or condition that believers will face, as described by Jesus, involving betrayal even by close family members.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_persecution.htm">Understanding Persecution</a></b><br>Recognize that persecution is a reality for believers, and it can come from unexpected sources, including family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_trials.htm">Faithfulness in Trials</a></b><br>Despite the pain of betrayal, believers are called to remain faithful to Christ, trusting in His ultimate justice and reward.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to difficult choices and strained relationships, but the eternal reward far outweighs the temporary suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_forgiveness.htm">Love and Forgiveness</a></b><br>Even in the face of betrayal, Christians are called to love and forgive, following Jesus' example on the cross.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_end_times.htm">Preparation for End Times</a></b><br>Believers should be spiritually prepared for the challenges of the end times, staying rooted in Scripture and prayer.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_13_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 13:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_13_12_Cost_of_following_Christ.htm">How does Mark 13:12 illustrate the cost of following Christ today?

Saving faith may cost earthly relationships, yet Christ promises, &#8220;Whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-35.htm">Mark 8:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A father his child</b><p>&#8226; The shock intensifies: parental instinct replaced by hostility. Jesus says persecution can twist even a father&#8217;s heart against his believing child.<p>&#8226; In Israel, <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a> allowed parents to bring a rebellious son to judgment; by Jesus&#8217; day, hostile fathers could invoke blasphemy laws against Christian offspring (see <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>, where parents feared expulsion).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s revolt against David (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>) shows family ties fractured by power and ideology. End-time pressures will multiply such fractures, reminding believers that their primary Father is in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; We prepare by clinging to God&#8217;s promise: &#8220;Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Children will rise against their parents and have them put to death</b><p>&#8226; Reversing normal authority, children betray parents. Jesus states, &#8220;Children will rise against their parents and have them put to death&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-12.htm">Mark 13:12</a>b). The word &#8220;rise&#8221; signals rebellion that hands parents to civil or religious courts.<p>&#8226; Luke records the same warning (<a href="/luke/21-16.htm">Luke 21:16</a>) and adds that some believers will be put to death. Paul expands the portrait: &#8220;Children will be disobedient to their parents&#8230;lovers of self rather than lovers of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; History confirms the prophecy&#8212;in Rome, infants were exposed for being Christian; in totalitarian regimes, sons and daughters reported Christian parents to authorities.<p>&#8226; Such scenes reveal the cost of discipleship as foretold by Jesus: &#8220;Whoever does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>). Yet they also highlight God&#8217;s sustaining grace (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/13-12.htm">Mark 13:12</a> paints a sober but clear picture: as the gospel advances toward the end of the age, satanic opposition will shatter even the strongest family bonds. Jesus prepares His followers by telling the truth&#8212;betrayal may come from brothers, fathers, and children. Rather than produce fear, the prophecy steadies us: the Lord knew these trials beforehand, rules over them, and promises eternal reward to those who endure to the end (<a href="/mark/13-13.htm">Mark 13:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Now the brother.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and the brother.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Our Lord further warns his disciples that they would have to suffer persecution even from their own relations, their brethren, and their fathers, who, forgetful of natural affection, would persecute the faithful even unto death. It is related of Woodman, a martyr in Sussex, in Queen Mary's time, that he was betrayed and taken by his father and his brother, and that he comforted himself with the thought that this very text of Scripture was verified in him. Bede says that our Lord predicted these evils, in order that his disciples, by a knowledge of them beforehand, might be the better able to bear them when they came. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Brother</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#948;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(adelphos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_80.htm">Strong's 80: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, member of the same religious community, especially a fellow-Christian.
