In the cultural context of first-century Judea, taking someone's property without permission would naturally provoke inquiry. This reflects the communal nature of society where actions were often questioned to maintain order. The phrase also highlights Jesus' foreknowledge and authority, as He anticipates the situation and provides a response. This mirrors other instances in the Gospels where Jesus demonstrates His divine insight, such as predicting Peter's denial or the events of His crucifixion.<p><b>tell him, &#8216;The Lord needs it</b><br>The term "The Lord" here is significant, as it implies Jesus' divine authority and ownership over all creation. In Jewish tradition, the term "Lord" (Adonai) was often used to refer to God, indicating Jesus' divine status. This request also fulfills the messianic prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, where the Messiah is described as coming to Jerusalem riding on a donkey. The use of "needs it" suggests a divine purpose, emphasizing that the actions of Jesus and His disciples are part of a larger, God-ordained plan.<p><b>and will return it shortly.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This assurance of returning the colt demonstrates respect for the owner's property and reflects the ethical teachings of Jesus regarding honesty and integrity. It also indicates the temporary nature of Jesus' earthly mission, as He often borrowed or used items for specific purposes, such as the borrowed tomb. This phrase reassures the owners of the colt, showing that Jesus' mission does not disrupt societal norms but fulfills them in a higher spiritual context. The temporary use of the colt also symbolizes the transient nature of Jesus' time on earth, pointing to His ultimate return and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is preparing for His triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

We can surrender whatever He requests, certain He will honor His word and supply our needs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither</span>. The Greek, according to the best authorities here, is <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">straightway he sendeth it back hither again</span>, The verb here in the present may represent the verb in the future, "he will send it back." But the word "again" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is not quite so easily explained. There is strong authority for the insertion of this word, which necessarily changes the meaning of the sentence. Without the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the sentence would actually mean that our Lord, by his Divine prescience, here tells his disciples that when the colt was demanded by them the owner would at once permit them to take it. But if the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> be inserted, it can only mean that this was a part of the message which our Lord directed his disciples to deliver as from himself, "The Lord hath need of him; and he, the Lord, will forthwith send him back again." The passage is so interpreted by Origen, who twice introduces the adverb in his commentary on St. Matthew. The evidence of the oldest uncials is strongly in favor of this insertion. Our Lord was unwilling that the disciples should take away the colt if the owner objected, lie might have taken the animals away in his own supreme right, but he chose to accomplish his will by his providence, powerfully and yet gently; and, if the reading here be allowed, he further influenced them by the promise that their property should be returned to them. It was the will and purpose of Christ, who for these three years had gone about on foot, and traveled over the whole of Palestine in this way, to show himself at length the King of Judah, that is, the Messiah and Heir of David; and so he resolves to enter Jerusalem, the metropolis, the city of the great King, with royal dignity. But he will not be surrounded with the" pomp and circumstance" of an earthly monarch. He rides on an ass's colt, that he might show his kingdom to be of another kind, that is, spiritual and heavenly. And so he assumes a humble equipage, riding upon a colt, his only housings being the clothes of his disciples. And yet there was dignity as well as humility in his equipage. The ass of the East was, and is, a superior animal to that known amongst us. The judges and princes of Israel rode on "white asses," and their sons on asses' colts. So our Lord rode upon an ass's colt; and there were no gleaming swords in his procession, or other signs of strife and bloodshed. But there were palm branches and garments spread all along his path - the evidences of devotion to him. So he came in gentleness, not that he might be feared on account of his power, but that he might be loved on account of his goodness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#940;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
