His position suggests he was a man of discipline and experience, likely familiar with executions. The fact that he was standing in front of Jesus indicates his role in overseeing the crucifixion, a common Roman method of execution for criminals and rebels. This setting underscores the tension between Roman authority and the Jewish populace, as well as the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about His death at the hands of Gentiles (<a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33</a>).<p><b>saw how He had breathed His last</b><br>The centurion witnessed Jesus' final moments, which were marked by an unusual manner of death. Unlike typical crucifixion victims who died slowly from asphyxiation, Jesus' death was sudden and voluntary, as He "gave up His spirit" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>). This act of willingly surrendering His life was significant, demonstrating His authority over life and death (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>). The centurion's observation of this unique event likely contributed to his subsequent declaration.<p><b>he said, &#8220;Truly this man was the Son of God!&#8221;</b><br>The centurion's proclamation is profound, especially coming from a Roman pagan. His statement acknowledges Jesus' divine identity, echoing the Gospel's opening declaration (<a href="/mark/1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) and Peter's confession (<a href="/mark/8-29.htm">Mark 8:29</a>). This moment fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where the suffering servant is recognized for His sacrificial role. The centurion's recognition of Jesus as the Son of God also prefigures the spread of the Gospel to the Gentiles, as seen in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with Cornelius, another centurion. This declaration serves as a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting the universal scope of Jesus' mission and the breaking down of barriers between Jew and Gentile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers.

It was the business of the centurion to watch all that took place, and to see that the sentence was executed. He must have been standing close under the cress; and there was that in the whole demeanour of the dying Sufferer, so different from anything that he had ever witnessed before, that it drew from him the involuntary exclamation, <span class="cmt_word">Truly this man was the Son of God</span>. He had observed him through those weary hours; he had noticed the meekness and the dignity of the Sufferer; he had heard those words, so deeply impressed upon the faith and reverence of Christians, which fell from him from time to time as he hung there; and then at last he heard the piercing cry, so startling, so unexpected, which escaped him just before he yielded up his spirit; and he could come to no other conclusion than this, that he was in very deed God's Son. It has been supposed by some that this centurion was Longiuus, who was led by the miracles which accompanied the death of Christ, to acknowledge him to be the Son of God, and to be a herald of his resurrection, and was ultimately himself put to death for the sake of Christ in Cappadocia. St. Chrysostom repeats the common report, that on account of his faith he was at last crowned with martyrdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/15-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
