The "seeds sown among the thorns" represent individuals who hear the word of God but are hindered by external influences. In the agricultural context of first-century Palestine, thorns and weeds were common obstacles to successful farming, often choking out the growth of crops. This imagery would have been familiar to Jesus' audience, who understood the challenges of cultivating land. The thorns symbolize the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth, which can stifle spiritual growth. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, where Jesus warns about serving two masters, and 1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>, which cautions against loving the world.<p><b>They hear the word,</b><br>Hearing the word refers to receiving the message of the Gospel. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, oral tradition was a primary means of communication, and hearing was often the first step in learning and understanding. The emphasis on hearing highlights the importance of being receptive to God's message. However, merely hearing is not sufficient; it requires a response. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a> underscores this by urging believers to be doers of the word, not just hearers. The act of hearing is the initial stage of faith, as stated in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ." This phrase challenges believers to move beyond passive listening to active engagement with the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, who is teaching the parable of the sower to a large crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The audience listening to Jesus' parables, representing a diverse group of people with varying levels of receptivity to His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' close followers who receive further explanation of the parables, representing those who seek deeper understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Symbolic of anyone who spreads the Word of God, including Jesus Himself.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thorns.htm">The Thorns</a></b><br>Represent the cares of the world, deceitfulness of wealth, and desires for other things that choke the Word, making it unfruitful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_thorns.htm">Understanding the Thorns</a></b><br>Recognize that the "thorns" in our lives can be anything that distracts us from God's Word, such as materialism, worries, or misplaced priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_distractions.htm">Guarding Against Distractions</a></b><br>Be vigilant in identifying and removing distractions that hinder spiritual growth and fruitfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_god's_word.htm">Prioritizing God's Word</a></b><br>Make a conscious effort to prioritize time in Scripture and prayer, ensuring that God's Word takes root deeply in our hearts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/evaluating_desires.htm">Evaluating Desires</a></b><br>Regularly assess personal desires and ambitions to ensure they align with God's will and do not compete with His Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultivating_a_fruitful_life.htm">Cultivating a Fruitful Life</a></b><br>Strive to cultivate a life that bears fruit by staying connected to Christ and allowing His Word to transform us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_4_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 4:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_life_s_worries_block_spiritual_growth_2.htm">How do "worries of this life" hinder spiritual growth in Mark 4:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_wealth_affect_faith_today.htm">What are modern examples of "deceitfulness of wealth" affecting faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Prioritize_God_s_Word_over_other_desires.htm">How can we prioritize God's Word over "desires for other things"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Mark_4_18_Matt_6_24_on_masters.htm">Compare Mark 4:18 with Matthew 6:24 on serving two masters.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_worldly_distractions.htm">What steps can you take to avoid being "choked" by worldly distractions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Thorns_in_Mark_4_18_vs_today_s_distractions.htm">How do the thorns in Mark 4:18 relate to modern distractions in life?

They are not imaginary; they sit in our churches, small groups, and families. &#8226; <a href="/mark/4-10.htm">Mark 4:10-12</a> shows that every listener receives the same message, yet the outcome varies. &#8226; <a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a> parallels this soil and confirms that these &#8220;others&#8221;&#8232; stand alongside the rocky-ground hearers and the path hearers, not above them. The word &#8220;others&#8221; reminds us that salvation is personal; nobody is swept into the kingdom by association (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are like the seeds</b><p>The seed is &#8220;the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>). In each soil it is exactly the same&#8212; living, potent, able to bear fruit (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). &#8226; The difference lies not in the seed but in the soil that receives it (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>). &#8226; Seeds are small, seemingly insignificant, yet they carry everything needed for a harvest (<a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>). When Jesus says &#8220;are like the seeds,&#8221; He highlights potential: a single seed can multiply thirty, sixty, or a hundredfold (<a href="/mark/4-8.htm">Mark 4:8</a>). The tragedy of this soil is that its potential is never realized.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sown among the thorns</b><p>Thorns spring up naturally in fallen ground (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-18</a>). They are not planted intentionally; they simply appear when the soil is left untended. Jesus identifies them: &#8220;the cares of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-19.htm">Mark 4:19</a>). &#8226; Cares: everyday worries (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>) grow quickly and crowd out eternal priorities (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>). &#8226; Deceitfulness of wealth: money promises security but can pierce with many sorrows (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>). &#8226; Desires for other things: any craving that displaces Christ, from hobbies to harmful habits (<a href="/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15-17</a>). Thorns do not attack suddenly; they choke gradually, wrapping around tender shoots until the plant cannot breathe (<a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They hear the word</b><p>Hearing alone is not enough (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>). These listeners sit under sound teaching and nod in agreement; the word reaches the ear but never governs the heart. &#8226; Demas &#8220;loved this present world&#8221; and walked away from ministry (<a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>), a living picture of a thorn-choked plant. &#8226; King Agrippa told Paul, &#8220;You almost persuade me to become a Christian&#8221; (<a href="/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>), yet almost is not faith. &#8226; Jesus urges, &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>); genuine hearing responds with obedience. In thorny soil the competing voices grow louder than the Shepherd&#8217;s voice, and fruitfulness dies in the bud.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/4-18.htm">Mark 4:18</a> warns that a heart cluttered with worldly cares, wealth&#8217;s lure, and competing desires can sit under the pure, life-giving gospel yet remain barren. The seed is flawless; the problem is a soil that refuses weeding. Vigilant repentance, continual surrender, and a single-minded love for Christ are the gardener&#8217;s tools that clear the thorns and make room for a bountiful harvest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">these are they which are sown among thorns</span>.

This is the third condition of soft; and it is so much better than the former, inasmuch as the thorns present less obstacles to the growth of the seed than the rocky ground does. This similitude indicates the heart of that hearer who is beset with the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Still</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[others]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(alloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_243.htm">Strong's 243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Other, another (of more than two), different.
