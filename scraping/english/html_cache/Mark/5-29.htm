This event occurs within the broader context of Jesus' healing ministry, showcasing His authority over physical ailments. The woman's condition, a chronic hemorrhage, rendered her ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25-27</a>), isolating her socially and religiously. Her healing signifies not only physical restoration but also reintegration into the community. This immediate cessation of bleeding contrasts with the prolonged suffering she endured, underscoring the completeness of Christ's healing.<p><b>and she sensed in her body</b><br>The phrase indicates a personal and internal awareness of healing, suggesting a deep, experiential knowledge of the change within her. This internal confirmation of healing reflects the holistic nature of Jesus' miracles, affecting both body and spirit. The woman's faith, demonstrated by her action of touching Jesus' garment, is met with a tangible response, illustrating the principle that faith, even when expressed in seemingly small acts, can lead to profound outcomes.<p><b>that she was healed of her affliction</b><br>The term "healed" signifies a complete restoration, not just a temporary relief. The word "affliction" denotes the severity and chronic nature of her condition, which had persisted for twelve years. This healing is a testament to Jesus' compassion and willingness to restore those who are marginalized and suffering. The narrative parallels other instances in the Gospels where Jesus heals those considered untouchable or unclean, such as lepers (<a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8:1-4</a>) and the demon-possessed (<a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5:1-20</a>). This miracle also prefigures the ultimate healing and restoration that Jesus offers through His death and resurrection, pointing to the eschatological hope of complete renewal for all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A central figure in this passage, she had been suffering from a bleeding condition for twelve years, which rendered her ceremonially unclean according to Jewish law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The healer and central figure of the Gospel, whose power and compassion are demonstrated in this miracle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people surrounding Jesus, making it difficult for the woman to approach Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The town where this event takes place, a significant location in Jesus' ministry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_healing_event.htm">The Healing Event</a></b><br>The miraculous moment when the woman touches Jesus' cloak and is instantly healed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The woman's faith led her to take bold action despite societal and religious barriers.
