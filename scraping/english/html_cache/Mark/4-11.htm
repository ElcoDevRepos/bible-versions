In the context of <a href="/mark/4.htm">Mark 4</a>, Jesus is addressing His disciples after delivering the Parable of the Sower. His reply is a direct communication to those who are close to Him, emphasizing the importance of understanding His teachings.<p><b>The mystery of the kingdom of God</b><br>The term "mystery" refers to divine truths that were previously hidden but are now revealed through Jesus Christ. The "kingdom of God" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. This mystery involves the unfolding plan of salvation and the establishment of God's reign through Christ. It connects to Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah and the new covenant (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>has been given to you</b><br>This phrase highlights the privilege and responsibility of the disciples. They are granted insight into the mysteries of God's kingdom, not through their own merit, but as a gift from God. This aligns with the concept of divine election and grace, where understanding is granted to those whom God chooses (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>).<p><b>but to those on the outside</b><br>"Those on the outside" refers to individuals who are not part of Jesus' inner circle of followers. This includes the religious leaders and the general populace who do not accept Jesus' message. The distinction between insiders and outsiders is a recurring theme in the Gospels, emphasizing the importance of faith and receptivity to God's word (<a href="/john/10-26.htm">John 10:26-27</a>).<p><b>everything is expressed in parables</b><br>Parables are a teaching method used by Jesus to convey spiritual truths through simple stories and analogies. For those open to His message, parables reveal deeper insights into the kingdom of God. However, for those who are resistant or indifferent, parables obscure the truth, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy about people who hear but do not understand (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>).

Therefore our Lord here encourages his own disciples to search out his words spoken in parables, and humbly to inquire into their full meaning, that so they might become able ministers and efficient preachers of the gospel. Moreover, by this he shows that this efficiency cannot be obtained by our own strength, but must be humbly sought for from God. For it is his own gift which he bestows on the disciples of Christ, and denies to others, whom he leaves to the blindness of their own hearts. It is as though he said, "To you, my disciples, my apostles, it is given, since you believe in me as the Messiah, to have continually more clear revelations from me of the mysteries of God and of heaven, by which you shall day by day increase in the knowledge and love of him. But from the scribes and others, because they will not believe in me as their own Messiah, God will take away even that small knowledge which they have of him and of his kingdom. Yea, he will deprive them of all the special privileges which they have hitherto possessed." But the words are not limited in their application to those who were living on the earth when Christ sojourned here. He says to all in every age who come within the reach of his gospel, "Those who come to me with a sincere heart and a simple desire to know the truth, as you, my apostles, are doing, to them I will reveal the mysteries of my kingdom, and I will help them onwards in the path of holiness, by which they may at length attain to the heavenly kingdom. But they who have not this pure desire of truth, but indulge their own lusts and errors, from them that little knowledge of God and of Divine things will by degrees be taken away, and they will become altogether blind."
