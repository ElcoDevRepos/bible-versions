The temple, originally built by Solomon, was reconstructed by Herod the Great and was a symbol of Jewish identity and religious practice. Jesus' departure signifies a transition from the old covenant to the new covenant, highlighting the shift from temple-based worship to a personal relationship with God through Christ. This moment foreshadows the eventual destruction of the temple in 70 AD, as prophesied by Jesus, marking the end of the temple era.<p><b>one of His disciples said to Him</b><br>The disciples often serve as representatives of the broader Jewish community, reflecting common thoughts and beliefs of the time. Their questions and comments provide insight into the expectations and understanding of the Messiah among first-century Jews. This interaction sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the future and the coming kingdom of God, emphasizing the need for spiritual insight over physical appearances.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher, look at the magnificent stones and buildings!&#8221;</b><br>The disciple's exclamation highlights the grandeur and architectural splendor of Herod's temple, which was renowned for its massive stones and impressive construction. The temple's magnificence was a source of national pride and religious significance for the Jewish people. However, Jesus uses this moment to redirect focus from physical structures to spiritual truths, emphasizing the transient nature of earthly things compared to the eternal kingdom of God. This statement also sets the context for Jesus' subsequent prophecy about the temple's destruction, underscoring the theme of impermanence and the need for faith in God's eternal plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, and the Messiah.

Earthly glory fades; Christ endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XIII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">One of his disciples.</span>--Note St. Mark's vivid way of giving the very words of the disciple, instead of saying with St. Matthew that they "came to show" the buildings of the Temple.<p>Here, again, the juxtaposition of narratives in St. Mark gives them a special point. The "stones" of Herod's Temple (for it was to him chiefly that it owed its magnificence) were of sculptured marble. The "buildings," or structures, included columns, chambers, porticos that were, as St. Luke tells us (<a href="/luke/21-5.htm" title="And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,">Luke 21:5</a>), the votive <span class= "ital">offerings</span> of the faithful. The disciples gazed on these with the natural admiration of Galilean peasants. In spite of the lesson they had just received--a lesson meant, it may be, to correct the tendency which our Lord discerned--they were still measuring things by their quantity and size. They admired the "goodly stones" more than the "widow's mite." They were now to be taught that, while the one should be spoken of throughout the whole world, the other should be destroyed, so that not a vestige should remain. We cannot say who spoke the words, but it is at least probable that it came from one of the four who are named in <a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as he went forth out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him Master, behold, what manner, of stones and what manner of buildings!</span> This would be in the evening. According to St. Luke (<a href="/luke/21-37.htm">Luke 21:37</a>), our Lord, during the early part of this <span class="accented">week</span>, passed his nights upon the Mount of Olives, taking his food at Bethany with Martha and Mary, and spending his days in the temple at Jerusalem, teaching the people. It is most probable that he left the temple by the golden gate on the east, from whence the view of the temple would be particularly striking. We learn from St. Matthew (24.) that our Lord had just been predicting the fall of Jerusalem. It was, therefore, natural for the disciples to call his attention at that moment to the grandeur and beauty of the building and its surroundings. The temple at Jerusalem was one of the wonders of the world. Josephus says that it wanted nothing that the eye and the mind could admire. It shone with a fiery splendor; so that when the eye gazed upon it, it turned away as from the rays of the sun. The size of the foundation-stones was enormous. Josephus speaks of some of the stones as forty-five cubits in length, five in height, and six in breadth. One of the foundation-stones, measured in recent times, proved to be nearly twenty-four feet in length, by four feet in depth. But all this magnificence had no effect upon our Lord, who only repeated the sentence of its downfall <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
