The number three often signifies completeness or emphasis in the Bible, as seen in other instances such as Peter's denial of Jesus three times (<a href="/mark/14-72.htm">Mark 14:72</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>). This repetition underscores the gravity of the moment and Jesus' commitment to His mission.<p><b>He said, &#8220;Are you still sleeping and resting?</b><br>Jesus addresses His disciples, who have fallen asleep despite His earlier requests to stay awake and pray (<a href="/mark/14-37.htm">Mark 14:37-38</a>). This reflects human frailty and the disciples' lack of understanding of the imminent events. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual vigilance required of believers, as echoed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>, which calls for alertness and sobriety.<p><b>That is enough!</b><br>This statement marks a turning point, indicating that the time for preparation has passed. It suggests a sense of urgency and the inevitability of the events to follow. The phrase can also be seen as a call to action, moving from a period of waiting to the fulfillment of prophecy and divine purpose.<p><b>The hour has come.</b><br>"The hour" refers to the appointed time for Jesus' suffering and crucifixion, a theme recurrent in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>, <a href="/john/17.htm">John 17:1</a>). This moment is the culmination of Jesus' earthly ministry and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as foretold in the Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>Look, the Son of Man is betrayed</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term used by Jesus to refer to Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, which speaks of a divine figure given authority and glory. The betrayal is a pivotal event, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of betrayal by a close friend. Judas Iscariot's role in this betrayal is a stark reminder of human treachery and the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan.<p><b>into the hands of sinners.</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jesus will be handed over to those who oppose Him, including the religious leaders and Roman authorities. The term "sinners" underscores the moral and spiritual blindness of those who reject Jesus, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of humanity's need for redemption. This moment sets the stage for the Passion, where Jesus, the sinless one, will bear the sins of the world, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the Garden of Gethsemane, preparing for His imminent betrayal and crucifixion.

The disciples&#8217; sleep warns against spiritual lethargy, while Christ&#8217;s resolute surrender reassures us that every step toward the cross is purposeful, prophetic, and under God&#8217;s control.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">And he cometh the third time.</span>--We may note St. Mark's omission of the third repetition of the prayer.<p><span class= "bld">It is enough.</span>--Peculiar to St. Mark, and probably noting the transition from the half-reproachful permission, "Sleep on now, and take your rest," to the emphatic and, as it were, startled exclamation, "the hour is come."<p><span class= "bld">Is</span> <span class= "bld">betrayed.</span>--The tense, as in St. Matthew, is present, "is at this moment being betrayed."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">the hour is</span> <span class="cmt_word">come.</span> Some have thought that our Lord here uses the language of irony. But it is far more consistent with his usual considerate words to suppose that, sympathizing with the infirmity of his disciples, he simply advised them, now that his bitter agony was over, to take some rest during the brief interval that remained. It is <span class="accented">enough.</span> Some commentators have thought that the somewhat difficult Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) would be better rendered, <span class="accented">he is at a distance</span>; as though our Lord meant to say, "There is yet time for you to take some rest. The betrayer is some distance off." Such an interpretation would require a full. stop between the clause now rendered, "it is enough," and the clause, "the hour is come;" so that the passage would read, "Sleep on now, and take your rest; he (that is, Judas) is yet a good way off." Then there would be an interval; and then our Lord would rouse them up with the words, "The hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners." This interpretation all hangs upon the true rendering of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, which, although it might be taken to. mean "he," or "it is distant," is nevertheless quite capable of the ordinary interpretation, "it sufficeth." According to the high authority of Hesychius, who explains it by the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, it seems safer on the whole to accept the ordinary meaning, "It is enough." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] returned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
