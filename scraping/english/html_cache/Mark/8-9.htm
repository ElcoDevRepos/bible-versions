This event is distinct from the feeding of the five thousand, which is recorded earlier in the Gospels. The number four thousand is significant in that it shows Jesus' ability to provide abundantly for a large crowd, demonstrating His divine power and compassion. The setting is likely in the region of the Decapolis, a predominantly Gentile area, which may indicate the inclusivity of Jesus' ministry beyond the Jewish population. This miracle parallels the provision of manna in the wilderness during the Exodus, highlighting Jesus as the provider and sustainer of life.<p><b>And when Jesus had dismissed the crowd,</b><br>This phrase shows Jesus' concern for the well-being of the people, ensuring they were fed before sending them away. The act of dismissing the crowd also indicates a transition in His ministry activities, as He often withdrew to pray or teach His disciples privately after such events. The dismissal reflects Jesus' authority and the orderly manner in which He conducted His ministry. It also underscores the importance of rest and reflection after intense periods of ministry, a practice Jesus modeled for His followers. This moment can be seen as a precursor to the Great Commission, where Jesus would later send His disciples out to minister to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing a miracle by feeding a large crowd with limited resources, demonstrating His divine power and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Approximately four thousand men, not including women and children, who have been following Jesus and listening to His teachings.

The disciples distributed seven loaves and a few small fish (<a href="/mark/8-5.htm">Mark 8:5-7</a>); the resulting abundance was evident to everyone present.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows God keeping careful count of His people&#8212;e.g., <a href="/numbers/1-46.htm">Numbers 1:46</a>; <a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>&#8212;reminding us that every individual matters to Him.<p>&#8226; Four thousand fed from such small provisions foreshadows Christ&#8217;s all-sufficiency for spiritual hunger (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the feeding of the five thousand, this crowd had been with Jesus three days (<a href="/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2</a>). Their persistence illustrates genuine seeking, which God rewards (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when Jesus had dismissed the crowd</b><p>&#8226; After satisfying their physical needs, Jesus &#8220;dismissed&#8221; them&#8212;He sends people away filled, not empty (<a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The dismissal shows pastoral care: He prevents exhaustion on their journey home (<a href="/mark/8-3.htm">Mark 8:3</a>). Shepherd imagery pervades Scripture (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus models orderly closure to ministry moments: feeding, teaching, then releasing. Paul follows this rhythm in <a href="/acts/20-1.htm">Acts 20:1</a>.<p>&#8226; By dismissing them Himself, Jesus protects the disciples from potential acclaim (cf. <a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>, where the crowd tried to make Him king). He keeps the focus on His mission toward the cross (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p>&#8226; The miracle ends with seven baskets of leftovers (<a href="/mark/8-8.htm">Mark 8:8</a>). Even in dismissal, overflow remains&#8212;symbolizing abundance available to future seekers (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/8-9.htm">Mark 8:9</a> records both the staggering scope of the miracle&#8212;about four thousand men fed&#8212;and the compassionate conclusion&#8212;Jesus personally dismissing a satisfied crowd. The verse underscores Christ&#8217;s precise care for individuals, His power to supply far beyond human resources, and His shepherd-like concern for the whole person. The literal details invite trust that the same Lord still notices, nourishes, and guides all who come to Him today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8033;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5613.htm">Strong's 5613: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably adverb of comparative from hos; which how, i.e. In that manner.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">four thousand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#953;&#963;&#967;&#943;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(tetrakischilioi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5070.htm">Strong's 5070: </a> </span><span class="str2">Four thousand.
