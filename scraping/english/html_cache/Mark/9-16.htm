The context is a gathering where the disciples are being questioned by a crowd, including scribes. This setting is significant as it highlights the tension between Jesus' followers and the religious authorities of the time. The term "disputing" suggests a heated argument or debate, which was common between Jesus' followers and the scribes, who often challenged Jesus' teachings and authority. This moment reflects the ongoing conflict between the new covenant Jesus was establishing and the old traditions upheld by the scribes.<br><br>The question also serves to draw attention to the issue at hand, which is the inability of the disciples to cast out a demon from a boy. This incident underscores the theme of faith and the power of belief, which is a recurring motif in the Gospel of Mark. Jesus' inquiry is not just about the immediate argument but also about the deeper spiritual struggle and the need for faith in God's power.<p><b>He asked.</b><br>The act of Jesus asking a question is a common teaching method used throughout the Gospels. It invites reflection and self-examination among those present. In this instance, Jesus' question serves to redirect the focus from the argument to the underlying issue of faith and reliance on divine power. It also demonstrates Jesus' authority and control over the situation, as He steps in to address the confusion and provide a solution.<br><br>This approach is consistent with Jesus' teaching style, where He often used questions to provoke thought and reveal deeper truths. It also aligns with the prophetic tradition, where questions are used to challenge and guide the people back to a right relationship with God. Jesus' question here is a call to move beyond mere debate and to seek understanding and faith in His power and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who asks the question.

Arguments that center on winning points rather than seeking truth reveal a heart drifting from humble dependence on Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Our calling is to &#8220;contend for the faith&#8221; (Jude 3) without slipping into quarrelsome spirits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with them?</b><p>The phrase draws a boundary line. Two groups face each other: the nine disciples on one side and the scribes on the other, with a desperate father and tormented boy caught in between (<a href="/mark/9-14.htm">Mark 9:14&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; question forces both sides to see the real issue: a suffering child who needs divine help, not theological one-upmanship (<a href="/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It also exposes the danger of us-versus-them thinking. Paul warns that knowledge without love &#8220;puffs up&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s emphasis on &#8220;them&#8221; challenges believers to evaluate whether our debates draw people closer to God or push them further away (<a href="/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He asked</b><p>Finally, Mark reminds us who is speaking: &#8220;He&#8221;&#8212;Jesus, the eternal Son&#8212;&#8220;asked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every question from Christ carries authority; when He speaks, storms still (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>) and graves open (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>).<p>&#8226; His gentle inquiry is also an invitation. By asking, He gives the crowd a chance to confess failure and seek His help, much like blind Bartimaeus who answered Jesus&#8217; question with a plea for mercy (<a href="/mark/10-51.htm">Mark 10:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Whenever Scripture reports that Jesus &#8220;asked,&#8221; it signals a teaching moment where He reshapes perceptions (<a href="/luke/2-46.htm">Luke 2:46&#8211;47</a>). Here, the coming miracle (<a href="/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25&#8211;27</a>) will reveal that power belongs to Him alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/9-16.htm">Mark 9:16</a> shows Jesus cutting through confusion with a single, probing question. He exposes motives (&#8220;What&#8221;), confronts fruitless argument (&#8220;are you disputing&#8221;), refocuses attention on people rather than positions (&#8220;with them?&#8221;), and asserts loving authority (&#8220;He asked&#8221;). The verse challenges us to lay down quarrels, listen to Christ, and bring every need&#8212;especially the needs of those caught in the middle&#8212;directly to Him who alone has the power to save and restore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he asked them; that is, the multitude</span>.
