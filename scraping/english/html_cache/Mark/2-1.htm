It suggests a brief period of rest or transition before the next significant event in His ministry. The timing is important as it shows the continuous and active nature of Jesus' ministry.<p><b>Jesus went back to Capernaum</b><br>Capernaum was a significant location in Jesus' ministry, often referred to as His "own city" (<a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1</a>). It was a fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee and served as a central hub for His activities. Archaeological findings, such as the remains of a synagogue and Peter's house, provide insight into the setting of many Gospel narratives. Capernaum's location made it a strategic place for Jesus to reach a diverse audience, including Jews and Gentiles.<p><b>And when the people heard that He was home</b><br>The phrase "He was home" suggests that Jesus had a base of operations in Capernaum, possibly at Peter's house, which is supported by archaeological evidence of a large house with Christian symbols. The people's quick response upon hearing of His return indicates Jesus' growing reputation and the anticipation surrounding His teachings and miracles.
