In the context of <a href="/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>, Jesus is addressing His disciples who were concerned about someone casting out demons in His name but not following them. This reflects a common theme in Jesus' teachings where He challenges the exclusivity and elitism that can arise within religious communities. The phrase suggests that those who are not actively opposing Jesus' work are, in a sense, supporting it. This can be connected to the broader biblical principle found in <a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>, where Jesus states, "Whoever is not with me is against me," highlighting the importance of allegiance to Christ. The cultural context of the time was one of division and sectarianism, and Jesus' statement would have been radical, promoting unity and cooperation among those who might not be part of the immediate group of disciples but still work in His name.<p><b>is for us.</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the idea of unity and support within the body of Christ. It suggests that those who are not opposing the work of Jesus are contributing to it, even if indirectly. This can be seen as a call to recognize and appreciate the diverse ways in which people can contribute to the mission of the Gospel. Historically, this would have been a significant teaching for the early church, which was composed of a diverse group of Jews and Gentiles, each bringing different perspectives and practices. Theologically, this phrase can be linked to the concept of the body of Christ as described in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul speaks of the church as one body with many parts, each with its own role and function. This teaching encourages believers to focus on common goals and shared faith rather than differences, fostering a spirit of cooperation and mutual support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, providing teaching to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being instructed on how to view those outside their immediate group.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unnamed_exorcist.htm">Unnamed Exorcist</a></b><br>A person casting out demons in Jesus' name, not part of the disciples' group, prompting this teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>The likely setting for this teaching, as much of Jesus' ministry in Mark occurs around this area.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_broader_community.htm">The Broader Community</a></b><br>Represents those who may not be direct followers of Jesus but still act in His name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_in_ministry.htm">Inclusivity in Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that those who are not actively opposing His work are considered allies.

In St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>) we find our Lord using a somewhat similar expression, only in an inverted order. He there says, "He that is not with me is against me." The lesson which both these apothegms teach is the same, that there is no such thing as neutrality in reference to Christ and his cause. We must be either with him or against him. Dr. Morison on St. Mark in this place says, "When in applied morals we sit in judgment on ourselves, we should in ordinary circumstances apply the law obversely and stringently,' he who is not with Christ is against him.' But when we are sitting in judgment on others, into whose hearts we cannot look directly, we should in ordinary circumstances apply the law reversely and generously, ' He that is not against Christ is with him.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
