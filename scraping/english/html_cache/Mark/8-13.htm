This departure signifies a rejection of their unbelief and hardness of heart. The Pharisees often opposed Jesus, seeking to test Him rather than genuinely seeking truth. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus distances Himself from those who are spiritually blind or resistant to His message.<p><b>got back into the boat</b><br>The boat is a recurring element in the Gospels, symbolizing Jesus' ministry around the Sea of Galilee. It serves as a means of travel and a place of teaching and rest. The Sea of Galilee was central to Jesus' ministry, and the boat allowed Him to reach various communities. This movement also illustrates the itinerant nature of His ministry, constantly moving to spread His message.<p><b>and crossed to the other side</b><br>Crossing to the other side of the Sea of Galilee often represents a transition in Jesus' ministry, moving from Jewish to Gentile regions or vice versa. This crossing signifies a shift in focus or audience, highlighting the inclusive nature of Jesus' mission. It also prefigures the spread of the Gospel beyond Jewish boundaries, aligning with the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who leaves the Pharisees and crosses to the other side of the lake.
