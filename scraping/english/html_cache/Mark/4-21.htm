Jesus frequently used parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of God to those who were willing to listen and understand. This method of teaching was common in Jewish tradition, where rabbis used stories to illustrate moral and spiritual lessons.<p><b>&#8220;Does anyone bring in a lamp</b><br>The lamp symbolizes the light of truth and revelation. In the context of Jesus' ministry, the lamp represents the message of the Gospel and the revelation of God's Kingdom. In ancient times, lamps were essential for providing light in homes, which were often dark due to small windows. The lamp is a metaphor for the illumination that Jesus brings into the world, dispelling spiritual darkness.<p><b>to put it under a basket or under a bed?</b><br>The rhetorical question highlights the absurdity of hiding a lamp, which is meant to provide light. The basket, likely a measuring basket, and the bed are symbols of concealment. In a spiritual sense, this suggests that the truth of the Gospel is not meant to be hidden or kept private but shared openly. The cultural context emphasizes the importance of visibility and the purpose of light, which is to illuminate and reveal.<p><b>Doesn&#8217;t he set it on a stand?</b><br>The stand is the appropriate place for a lamp, ensuring that its light reaches as far as possible. This reflects the believer's responsibility to live out and proclaim the truth of the Gospel. The imagery of setting a lamp on a stand aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world. The stand represents the public and visible nature of Christian witness, encouraging believers to let their light shine before others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples and the crowd through parables.

Any attempt to conceal it, whether by fear, complacency, or distraction, contradicts the very reason the light was given. Instead, the verse calls every disciple to place the lamp on its stand, openly and courageously illuminating the world with the truth that saves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel</span>?--See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-15.htm" title="Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all that are in the house.">Matthew 5:15</a>. St. Mark, it will be noted, omits all the other parables that follow in St. Matthew, and connects with that of the Sower sayings more or less proverbial, which in St. Matthew appear in a different context. Looking at our Lord's method of teaching by the repetition of proverbs under different aspects and on different occasions, it is not unlikely that this of the "candle" was actually spoken in the connection in which we find it here. Their knowledge of the meaning of the parable was not given them for themselves alone, but was to shine forth to others. We probably owe to the saying so uttered the record of this parable given in three out of the four Gospels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is a candle brought to be put under</span> a bushel, etc.?

It is evident that he repeated his sayings, and used them sometimes in a different connection. The lamp is here the light of Divine truth, shining in the person of Christ. <span class="accented">Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel</span>? It comes to us. The light in our souls is not of our own kindling; it comes to us from God, that we may manifest it for his glory. "The bushel" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), from the Latin <span class="accented">medias</span>, a measure containing flour, was the flour-bin, a part of the furniture of every house, as was the tall lampstand with its single light. St, Luke (<a href="/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>) calls it "a vessel" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The light is to be set on "a lamp-stand," and in like manner the light which we have received is to shine before men. As Christians, we are Christ's light-bearers. By this illustration our Lord teaches that he was unwilling that the mysteries of this great parable of the sower and of other parables should be concealed, but that his disciples should unfold these things to others as he had to them, although at present they might not be able to receive them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] also said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elegen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
