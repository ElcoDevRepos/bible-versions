The term "dull" suggests a spiritual insensitivity or slowness to grasp spiritual truths. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where the disciples often struggle to comprehend Jesus' teachings (e.g., <a href="/mark/4-13.htm">Mark 4:13</a>, <a href="/matthew/15-16.htm">Matthew 15:16</a>). The question is rhetorical, emphasizing the expectation that they should have understood His teachings by now. This moment underscores the patience of Jesus as a teacher and the gradual process of spiritual enlightenment.<p><b>&#8220;Do you not understand?&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus continues to challenge His disciples' comprehension. The question implies that the understanding He expects is not merely intellectual but spiritual. This connects to the broader biblical theme of spiritual discernment, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where spiritual truths are understood through the Spirit. The disciples' lack of understanding serves as a reminder of the need for divine revelation to truly grasp the things of God.<p><b>Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him,</b><br>This statement addresses the Jewish dietary laws and the Pharisaic traditions that emphasized external purity. In the historical and cultural context, Jewish law was deeply concerned with ritual cleanliness, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. Jesus' teaching here challenges the prevailing Jewish thought by asserting that true defilement is not about external factors but internal ones. This anticipates the New Covenant understanding of purity, where the focus shifts from external observance to the condition of the heart (see <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>). This teaching also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the faith, as dietary laws were a significant barrier between Jews and Gentiles. Jesus, as the fulfillment of the Law, redefines purity, pointing to the internal transformation that He brings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the true nature of defilement, challenging the traditional Jewish understanding of purity laws.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are struggling to understand His teachings about what truly defiles a person.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are the religious leaders whose traditions and interpretations of the law Jesus is challenging in this broader passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_purity_laws.htm">Jewish Purity Laws</a></b><br>The context of this teaching involves the Jewish customs and laws regarding clean and unclean foods, which were a significant part of Jewish religious life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Earlier in the chapter, Jesus addresses the crowd, setting the stage for this teaching moment with His disciples.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_true_defilement.htm">Understanding True Defilement</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that defilement is not about external factors but the condition of the heart.

Spiritual life demands alertness, not passive observation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do you not understand?</b><p>&#8226; Jesus presses the disciples to interpret events through Scriptural lenses, recalling His earlier parable challenge, &#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Understanding, in the biblical sense, is grasping God&#8217;s intent so fully that it transforms conduct (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord expects growth: what was once obscure should now be clear, because truth builds line upon line (<a href="/matthew/13-51.htm">Matthew 13:51-52</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today likewise receive the Spirit &#8220;so that we may understand what God has freely given us&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him</b><p>&#8226; Jesus overturns ritualistic thinking that equated holiness with food laws and ceremonial washings (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>; <a href="/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3-4</a>), pointing instead to the heart&#8217;s moral state (<a href="/mark/7-20.htm">Mark 7:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; He foreshadows the later revelation to Peter: &#8220;What God has made clean, you must not call impure&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; see also <a href="/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Food is physically processed and &#8220;into the sewer&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a>), never touching the soul; sin arises from within&#8212;envy, pride, deceit&#8212;those corrupt the person.<p>&#8226; This teaching liberates conscience while intensifying moral responsibility: externals no longer excuse inner rebellion (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ ultimately fulfills the law, making purity a matter of grace-shaped hearts rather than menu lists (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18</a> shows Jesus jolting His followers awake: outward rituals can&#8217;t cleanse or stain; only the heart&#8217;s posture before God matters. He calls disciples&#8212;then and now&#8212;to move from dull hearing to Spirit-sharpened understanding, embracing true holiness that springs from within and radiates outward through obedient lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - Our Lord had already, in his sermon on the mount, taught his disciples fully wherein purity or impurity of heart consists, and he might, therefore, with good reason, ask them how it was that they, even they who had been so favored by being constantly with him, had forgotten or misunderstood him. Our Lord's illustration is physically accurate. The portion carried off is that which by its removal purifies what remains. The part which is available for nourishment is, in its passage through the system, converted into chyle, the matter from which the blood is formed. What is not available for nourishment passes away into the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, or draught, <span class="cmt_word">Purging all meats</span>. The most approved reading here is undoubtedly the masculine (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f30;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), and not the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This change of reading compels a somewhat different construction. Accepting, therefore, the masculine as the true reading, the only possible rendering is that which makes this last clause a comment by the evangelist upon our Lord's previous words, in which he indicates to the reader that our Lord intended by this illustration to show that no food, of whatever kind, when received with thanksgiving, can make a man unclean. The clause must, therefore, be connected with the preceding words, by the introduction of the words, in italics, "This he <span class="accented">said</span>, making all meats clean." The passage, thus rendered, becomes a very significant exposition of what has gone before. It is well worthy of notice that this explanation is to be found in St. Chrysostom (Homily on St. <a href="/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>.): <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: "But Mark affirms that he said these things, making the meats clean." It may be added that this explanation agrees finely with the words in <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>, "What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Are</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(este)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
