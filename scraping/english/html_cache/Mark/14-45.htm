Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, approaches Jesus with a clear purpose. This moment occurs in the Garden of Gethsemane, a place Jesus often visited with His disciples. The direct approach signifies Judas's role in the betrayal, fulfilling the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the Messiah. The act of going directly to Jesus also underscores the personal nature of the betrayal, as Judas had been a trusted member of Jesus's inner circle.<p><b>he said, &#8220;Rabbi!&#8221;</b><br>By addressing Jesus as "Rabbi," Judas uses a term of respect and acknowledgment of Jesus's role as a teacher. This title was commonly used by the disciples and others who recognized Jesus's authority in teaching. However, in this context, the use of "Rabbi" is deeply ironic and hypocritical, as Judas's actions contradict the respect implied by the term. This moment reflects the theme of betrayal by those closest to Jesus, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/13-6.htm">Zechariah 13:6</a>, which speaks of wounds received in the house of friends.<p><b>and kissed Him.</b><br>The kiss, a customary greeting in Jewish culture, was intended to be a sign of affection and respect. However, Judas uses it as a prearranged signal to identify Jesus to the arresting soldiers. This act of betrayal through a kiss is particularly poignant, as it turns a gesture of love into one of treachery. The kiss fulfills the prophecy of betrayal and highlights the depth of Judas's deceit. It also serves as a type of Christ's suffering, where He is betrayed by one of His own, paralleling the experiences of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26-28</a>, who was betrayed by his brothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrays Him with a kiss.

It is possible that this was the usual mode with which the disciples greeted Christ when they returned to him after any absence. But Judas abused this token of friendship, using it for a base and treacherous purpose. St. Chrysostom says that he felt assured by the gentleness of Christ that he would not repel him, or that, if he did, the treacherous action would have answered its purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Going</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proselth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">directly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(euthys)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2112.htm">Strong's 2112: </a> </span><span class="str2">Immediately, soon, at once.
