The region referred to is likely the area around Gennesaret, a fertile plain on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. This area was densely populated, and the people&#8217;s response indicates their recognition of Jesus' healing power. The act of running suggests a deep desperation and hope for healing, reflecting the widespread reputation Jesus had gained. This urgency can be compared to the fervor seen in other parts of the Gospels, such as the crowds following Jesus in <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24-25</a>.<p><b>carrying the sick on mats</b><br>The use of mats indicates the condition of the sick, many of whom were likely unable to walk or move on their own. This reflects the communal effort and compassion of the people, as they were willing to carry their loved ones to Jesus. The mats, simple and portable, were common in that era for transporting those who were ill. This act of carrying the sick parallels the story of the paralytic in <a href="/mark/2.htm">Mark 2:1-12</a>, where friends lowered a man through a roof to reach Jesus, demonstrating faith and determination.<p><b>to wherever they heard He was</b><br>This phrase underscores the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry. The people&#8217;s reliance on word-of-mouth to locate Jesus shows the lack of modern communication methods and the importance of community networks. It also highlights the widespread belief in Jesus' ability to heal, as people were willing to travel to any location He was reported to be. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of the Messiah bringing healing and restoration. The phrase also emphasizes the omnipresence of Jesus' influence, as His reputation spread rapidly across regions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sick.htm">The Sick</a></b><br>Individuals suffering from various ailments, seeking healing from Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region.htm">The Region</a></b><br>Refers to the area around Gennesaret, where Jesus and His disciples landed after crossing the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Residents of the region who recognized Jesus and took action to bring the sick to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mats.htm">The Mats</a></b><br>Simple bedding used to transport the sick, indicating the urgency and faith of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The people&#8217;s immediate response to Jesus&#8217; presence shows their faith.

The crowds instantly recognize Him and spring into action.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Ran&#8221; shows urgency. They do not stroll or send a polite invitation; they sprint. The same eagerness appears earlier when &#8220;the whole town gathered at the door&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-33.htm">Mark 1:33</a>) and when people &#8220;came from all Judea and Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Whole region&#8221; highlights the widespread impact of Christ&#8217;s ministry. His fame has already spread &#8220;throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-28.htm">Mark 1:28</a>). What started in Capernaum now covers miles of countryside.<p>&#8226; For today: Scripture presents this as simple fact&#8212;people literally running because meeting Jesus mattered more than anything else. Their example presses us to examine what pace we set when it comes to seeking Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carrying the sick on mats</b><p>&#8220;carrying the sick on mats&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55</a>)<p>&#8226; The crowds do not come empty-handed. They shoulder stretchers, rough blankets, anything that will bear the weight of a friend. It echoes the four men who dug through a roof to lower a paralytic before Jesus (<a href="/mark/2-3.htm">Mark 2:3&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The sick themselves are passive, but their helpers act in faith. James later writes, &#8220;I will show you my faith by my deeds&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>). These carriers embody that principle centuries before James pens it.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes surface in <a href="/acts/5-15.htm">Acts 5:15</a>, where people lay the sick on cots so Peter&#8217;s shadow might fall on them. The pattern is clear: when God&#8217;s power is near, believers move obstacles to place the needy in its path.<p>&#8226; Application: Scripture assures that Christ still welcomes those who are &#8220;weary and burdened&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). While healing methods differ today, the call to bear one another&#8217;s burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>) remains literal and urgent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To wherever they heard He was</b><p>&#8220;to wherever they heard He was.&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55</a>)<p>&#8226; News of Jesus&#8217; location spreads by word of mouth, just as it did after He raised the widow&#8217;s son: &#8220;This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-17.htm">Luke 7:17</a>). People trust the reports and act on them.<p>&#8226; They do not wait for an official itinerary. If He is in a village, they go. If He moves to an open field, they adjust. Their flexibility reflects the sheep that recognize the Shepherd&#8217;s voice and follow (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores persistence. Earlier, crowds &#8220;got into boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-24.htm">John 6:24</a>). Here, they repeat the pattern on land.<p>&#8226; For believers now: we find Jesus through the sure testimony of Scripture. Whenever the Word is faithfully preached, that is &#8220;where He is,&#8221; and we gather&#8212;physically if possible, digitally if necessary&#8212;with the same expectancy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot of urgent faith: people sprinting across the countryside, hoisting helpless friends, and homing in on any spot Jesus occupies. The verse confirms Christ&#8217;s magnetic authority, the crowds&#8217; active belief, and the community&#8217;s compassion. It invites us to match their pace&#8212;eagerly, sacrificially, and persistently bringing ourselves and others to the living Lord whose power and mercy have never diminished.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-55.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and] ran through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#941;&#948;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(periedramon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4063.htm">Strong's 4063: </a> </span><span class="str2">To run around.
