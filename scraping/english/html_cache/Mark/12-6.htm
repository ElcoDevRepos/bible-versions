In the context of the parable, the son represents Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). The term "beloved" echoes God's declaration at Jesus' baptism and transfiguration, where He calls Jesus His beloved Son (<a href="/mark/1-11.htm">Mark 1:11, 9</a>:7). This reflects the deep love and approval of the Father for the Son, underscoring the intimate relationship within the Trinity. The use of "one" signifies the exclusivity and irreplaceability of the son, pointing to the singular role of Christ in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>he sent him to them</b><br>The act of sending the son signifies the culmination of God's outreach to humanity. In the parable, the vineyard owner (representing God) sends his son after the tenants have mistreated previous servants, symbolizing the prophets who were sent to Israel and often rejected (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). This sending is a final, decisive act, illustrating God's patience and desire for reconciliation. It also foreshadows the mission of Jesus, who was sent into the world to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The sending of the son is a pivotal moment, representing the ultimate revelation of God's love and authority.<p><b>&#8216;They will respect my son,&#8217; he said</b><br>This statement reflects the expectation of honor and reverence due to the son, based on his identity and relationship to the owner. In a cultural context, sending a son would imply a higher level of authority and demand greater respect than previous messengers. However, the tragic irony is that the tenants do not respect the son, paralleling the rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders of His time. This expectation of respect also connects to the broader biblical theme of honoring God's messengers and ultimately God Himself (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). The phrase underscores the tragic misunderstanding and rejection of Jesus, despite His rightful claim to authority and respect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

and rejected, this word signals the climactic moment of the parable (<a href="/mark/12-2.htm">Mark 12:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s patient sequence of sending prophet after prophet (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) is drawing to a decisive close.<p>- The timing underscores divine longsuffering and the seriousness of what comes next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Having one beloved son</b><p>- &#8220;Beloved&#8221; echoes the Father&#8217;s own voice at Jesus&#8217; baptism: &#8220;You are My beloved Son&#8221; (<a href="/mark/1-11.htm">Mark 1:11</a>).<p>- The &#8220;one&#8221; highlights uniqueness; unlike the many servants (prophets), there is only one Son (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>).<p>- The identity is unmistakable: Jesus is the heir, carrying the full authority and affection of the Father (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p>- This reveals the depth of the Father&#8217;s love&#8212;that He would risk His dearest treasure for rebellious tenants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sent him to them</b><p>- The Incarnation is pictured in simple terms: the Father dispatches the Son into a hostile world (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>).<p>- &#8220;To them&#8221; points first to Israel, the covenant people (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>), yet extends ultimately to all humanity (<a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<p>- The sending is purposeful: to claim rightful fruit, to call to repentance, and to secure redemption (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>; 19:10).<p>- Unlike the servants, the Son arrives with final authority&#8212;his presence leaves the tenants without excuse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They will respect my son,&#8221; he said</b><p>- Respect (or &#8220;reverence&#8221;) is the rightful response to the heir (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; <a href="/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>).<p>- The owner&#8217;s expectation exposes the tenants&#8217; guilt; any failure to honor the Son is deliberate rebellion, not misunderstanding (<a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>).<p>- Prophetically, the statement looks ahead to the mixed reactions Jesus would face: some would honor Him (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>), others would reject and kill Him (<a href="/mark/12-7.htm">Mark 12:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>- Ultimately every knee will bow and every tongue confess His lordship (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12&#8211;13</a>), fulfilling the owner&#8217;s rightful demand for reverence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/mark/12-6.htm">Mark 12:6</a> unveils the climax of God&#8217;s redemptive story: After many prophetic appeals, the Father sends His unique, beloved Son to claim what is rightfully His. The verse highlights divine patience, the incomparable worth of Christ, the mission of incarnation, and the moral duty to honor the Son. Accepting or rejecting Him becomes the decisive issue for every listener, then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">His well-beloved.</span>--Added by St. Mark to St. Matthew's briefer form, "he sent unto them his son."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having yet therefore one son, his well-beloved</span>. There is strong evidence in favor of a different reading here: namely (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>), he had yet one, a beloved son. There is something very touching in this form of expression. Many messages had been sent; many means had been tried. But one other resource remained. "There is one, a beloved on. I will send him; they will, surely reverence him (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f30;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). They will reflect, and reflection will bring shame and submission and reverence." This was the last effort of Divine mercy - the sending of the Incarnate God, whom the Jews put to death without the city. St. Mark's words seem rather to imply that they killed him within the vineyard, and cast out the dead body. But it is possible that in his narrative he mentions the climax first - <span class="cmt_word">they killed him</span>, and then returns to a detail of the dreadful tragedy; they cast him out of the vineyard, and there slew him (See <a href="/matthew/21-39.htm">Matthew 21:39</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#967;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eschaton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2078.htm">Strong's 2078: </a> </span><span class="str2">Last, at the last, finally, till the end.
