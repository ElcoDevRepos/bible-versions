The Greek word for "warned" can also mean "strictly charged" or "commanded," indicating the seriousness of His instruction. This reflects Jesus' awareness of the timing and nature of His mission. He often used this approach to control the spread of information about His identity, ensuring that His ministry unfolded according to divine timing rather than human expectation.<p><b>not to tell anyone</b><br>Jesus' instruction to keep His identity a secret is known as the "Messianic Secret." This was a strategic move to prevent misunderstandings about His mission. Many Jews of the time expected a political Messiah who would overthrow Roman rule, but Jesus came to establish a spiritual kingdom. By controlling the revelation of His identity, Jesus aimed to avoid premature confrontations with religious and political authorities and to prevent the crowds from forcing Him into a role He did not come to fulfill.<p><b>about Him</b><br>The focus on "Him" underscores the centrality of Jesus' identity in the Gospel narrative. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the Messiah is progressively revealed. This phrase also highlights the personal nature of the disciples' relationship with Jesus, as they were entrusted with the knowledge of His true identity. This command to silence contrasts with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where the disciples are later instructed to spread the message of Jesus to all nations, indicating a shift in the divine plan following His resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching His disciples about His identity and mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being instructed not to reveal His identity as the Messiah at this point in His ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesarea_philippi.htm">Caesarea Philippi</a></b><br>The region where this conversation takes place, a location known for its pagan worship and diverse religious beliefs, highlighting the contrast between Jesus' true identity and the surrounding beliefs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timing_in_god's_plan.htm">The Importance of Timing in God's Plan</a></b><br>Jesus' instruction to keep His identity secret underscores the significance of divine timing.

Similar firm instructions appear in <a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>; 3:12; and 5:43, underscoring that Jesus often controlled the spread of information about Himself.<p>&#8226; Reasons for this sternness include:<p>&#8211; Preventing premature confrontation with authorities (<a href="/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>).<p>&#8211; Guarding against misunderstandings of His mission (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>, where crowds sought a political king).<p>&#8211; Ensuring the disciples listened first, spoke later (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning models the seriousness with which every believer should receive Christ&#8217;s commands (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not to tell anyone</b><p>&#8226; Timing mattered.

Why was this? There were many reasons for this reticence. The state of parties in Palestine was most inexpedient for such a disclosure at that time. Those who were favorable to his cause would have wanted at once to take him by force and make him a king. In fact, some of them made no secret of their intentions (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). Those, on the other hand, who were opposed to him were only watching their opportunity to destroy him. Moreover, his own disciples had yet many things to learn; and besides all this, faith in his Godhead would be easier when his death should have been followed by his glorious resurrection and ascension. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] warned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#943;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epetim&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2008.htm">Strong's 2008: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and timao; to tax upon, i.e. Censure or admonish; by implication, forbid.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
