It commemorates the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, during which they left in haste and did not have time to let their bread rise. This feast is a time of remembrance and purification, as leaven is often symbolic of sin in the Bible (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>). The timing of this event is significant as it sets the stage for Jesus' impending sacrifice, aligning with the themes of deliverance and redemption.<p><b>when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed</b><br>The Passover lamb is central to the Passover celebration, symbolizing the lamb whose blood was used to protect the Israelites from the final plague in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12:1-13</a>). This act of sacrifice and the blood's protective power foreshadow Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), whose sacrifice would bring salvation to humanity. The timing of Jesus' crucifixion during Passover underscores His role as the ultimate Passover Lamb.<p><b>Jesus&#8217; disciples asked Him</b><br>The disciples' inquiry reflects their role as followers and learners, seeking guidance from their Rabbi. It also highlights their awareness of the importance of the Passover meal and their desire to honor this tradition. This moment illustrates the disciples' dependence on Jesus for direction and understanding, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?&#8221;</b><br>This question indicates the disciples' readiness to serve and their recognition of Jesus' authority. The preparation of the Passover meal was a detailed process, involving the selection of a suitable location and the necessary provisions. This inquiry also sets the stage for the Last Supper, where Jesus would institute the New Covenant through the breaking of bread and sharing of the cup (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>). The Passover meal thus becomes a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, symbolizing the transition from the Old Covenant to the New.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, preparing to observe the Passover with His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are tasked with preparing the Passover meal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A Jewish festival that begins with the Passover, commemorating the Israelites' exodus from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover_lamb.htm">Passover Lamb</a></b><br>The sacrificial lamb that is central to the Passover meal, symbolizing deliverance and redemption.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the Passover meal is to be prepared and celebrated.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_significance_of_passover.htm">Understanding the Significance of Passover</a></b><br>The Passover is not just a historical event but a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work.
