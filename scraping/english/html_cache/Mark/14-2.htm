The Passover was a significant Jewish feast commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12). The leaders feared that arresting Jesus during this time could incite unrest among the people, who held Him in high regard (<a href="/mark/11-18.htm">Mark 11:18</a>). This reflects their political calculations and desire to avoid Roman intervention, as the Romans were vigilant about maintaining peace during such large gatherings.<p><b>they said,</b><br>This phrase indicates a private discussion among the chief priests and scribes. Their plotting against Jesus was done in secret, highlighting their fear of public opinion and their awareness of Jesus' popularity.

The Jewish people were under Roman occupation, and any disturbance could lead to severe repercussions from the Roman authorities. This concern for a riot underscores the tension between the Jewish leaders' desire to eliminate Jesus and their need to maintain public order. It also foreshadows the eventual public outcry during Jesus' trial, where the crowd, influenced by the leaders, demands His crucifixion (<a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who were plotting to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill Him.

Matthew records the same caution: &#8220;Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-5.htm">Matthew 26:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Though the rulers tried to avoid action during this timeframe, God&#8217;s sovereign plan placed the crucifixion of the true Passover Lamb precisely during the very feast that foreshadowed Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>; <a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they said</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;They&#8221; refers to &#8220;the chief priests and scribes&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1</a>) who were already plotting &#8220;in stealth&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-2.htm">Luke 22:2</a>).<p>&#8211; These men, guardians of the Law, now conspire to break it by engineering a murder (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>). Their words reveal deliberate calculation, not impulsive outrage.<p>&#8211; Their fear of public opinion shows that, at this point, Jesus&#8217; popularity still offered Him a measure of protection (<a href="/mark/12-12.htm">Mark 12:12</a>; <a href="/john/12-19.htm">John 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or there may be a riot</b><p>&#8211; Riots were not uncommon in festival crowds; Rome watched Passover week closely (<a href="/luke/23-5.htm">Luke 23:5</a>; <a href="/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a>).<p>&#8211; A disorderly mob would attract Roman troops from the Antonia Fortress, jeopardizing the leaders&#8217; own positions (<a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>).<p>&#8211; They desired Jesus dead, but they wanted it done quietly, without jeopardizing their relationship with Rome or their influence over Israel (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among the people</b><p>&#8211; &#8220;The people&#8221; (Greek laos, the common populace) had hailed Jesus a few days earlier during the Triumphal Entry (<a href="/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Many still listened to His teaching &#8220;with delight&#8221; in the temple courts (<a href="/mark/12-37.htm">Mark 12:37</a>).<p>&#8211; The leaders feared that sudden violence against a perceived prophet would turn the multitudes against them (<a href="/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Ironically, the same crowds that could riot in His defense would soon be manipulated into shouting, &#8220;Crucify Him!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-11.htm">Mark 15:11-13</a>), proving how fickle human allegiance can be when truth is suppressed (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/14-2.htm">Mark 14:2</a> reveals a calculated, politically driven pause in the rulers&#8217; plan to kill Jesus. Wanting to avoid a public backlash during the highly attended feast, they chose stealth over open confrontation. Yet their caution only highlights God&#8217;s greater design: the Lamb of God would indeed die during Passover, fulfilling centuries of prophetic symbolism, despite every human scheme to the contrary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they said</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) literally, <span class="accented">for they were saying - <span class="cmt_word"></span>Not during</span> <span class="cmt_word">the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the people.</span> The same cause induced them to avoid the time of the feast. The feast brought a great multitude of <span class="accented">Jews to</span> Jerusalem, amongst whom would be many who had received bodily or spiritual benefits from Christ, and who therefore, at least, worshipped him as a Prophet; and the rulers of the people feared lest these should rise in his defense. Their first intention, therefore, was not to destroy him until after the close of the Paschal feast; but they were overruled by the course of events, all ordered by God's never-failing providence. The sudden betrayal of our Lord by Judas led them to change their minds. For when they found that he was actually in their hands, they resolved to crucify him forthwith. And thus the Divine purpose was fulfilled that Christ should suffer at that particular time, and so the type be satisfied. For the lamb slain at the Passover was a type of the very Paschal Lamb to be sacrificed at that particular time, in the predetermined purpose of God; and to be lifted up upon the cross for the redemption of the world. St. Matthew (Matthew 26:3) tells us that they were gathered together "unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas." It was necessary to state his name, because the high priests were now frequently changed by the Roman power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;[But] not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
