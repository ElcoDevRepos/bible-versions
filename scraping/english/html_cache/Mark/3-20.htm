Capernaum was a significant town on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, known for its fishing industry and trade routes. The mention of "home" suggests a place of rest and retreat, yet it also highlights the constant demands on Jesus' time and energy. This setting underscores the humanity of Jesus, who, despite His divine mission, sought moments of respite.<p><b>and once again a crowd gathered,</b><br>The gathering of the crowd reflects Jesus' growing popularity and the widespread interest in His teachings and miracles. This recurring theme in the Gospels illustrates the magnetic nature of Jesus' ministry, drawing people from various backgrounds. The crowd's presence signifies the deep spiritual hunger and curiosity among the people, as well as the pressing needs for healing and hope. It also foreshadows the challenges Jesus would face in balancing His public ministry with personal time for prayer and instruction of His disciples.<p><b>so that He and His disciples could not even eat.</b><br>This detail highlights the intensity and demands of Jesus' ministry. The inability to eat due to the crowd's presence emphasizes the self-sacrificial nature of Jesus' work and His commitment to serving others. It also reflects the cultural hospitality norms of the time, where sharing meals was an important social and communal activity. The disciples' involvement indicates their close association with Jesus and their shared experiences in the ministry. This scenario parallels other instances in the Gospels where Jesus prioritizes spiritual nourishment over physical needs, such as in <a href="/john/4-31.htm">John 4:31-34</a>, where He speaks of doing the will of the Father as His food.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching with authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are learning from His teachings and witnessing His works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>Represents the people who are drawn to Jesus, often seeking healing or to hear His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/home.htm">Home</a></b><br>Likely refers to a house in Capernaum, which served as a base for Jesus' ministry in Galilee.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_demand_of_ministry.htm">The Demand of Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus' ministry was so demanding that He and His disciples could not even eat.

According to the most approved reading, the words are (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">He cometh into an house</span>, or, <span class="accented">He cometh home.</span> There is here a considerable gap in St. Mark's narrative. The sermon on the mount followed upon the call of the apostles, at all events so far as it affected them and their mission. Moreover, St. Matthew interposes here two miracles wrought by our Lord after his descent from the mount, and before his return to his own house at Capernaum. St. Mark seems anxious here to hasten on to describe the treatment of our Lord by his own near relatives at this important crisis in his ministry. <span class="cmt_word">So that they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e</span>., our Lord and his disciples - <span class="cmt_word">could not so much as eat bread</span>; such was the pressure of the crowd upon them. St. Mark evidently records this, in order to show the contrast between the zeal of the multitude and the very different feelings of our Lord's own connections. They, his friends, when they heard how he was thronged, <span class="cmt_word">went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself</span>. This little incident is mentioned only by St. Mark. When his friends saw him so bent upon his great mission as to neglect his bodily necessities, they considered that he was bereft of his reason, that too much zeal and piety had deranged his mind. His friends went out (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to lay hold on him. They may probably have come from Nazareth. St. John (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>) says that "even his brethren did not believe on him;" that is, they did not believe in him with that fuiness of trust which is of the essence of true faith. Their impression was that he was in a condition requiring that he should be put under some restraint. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#961;&#967;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(erchetai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">home,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7990;&#954;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oikon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3624.htm">Strong's 3624: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dwelling; by implication, a family.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">once again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
