This setting allowed Him to reach a diverse audience, including fishermen, traders, and travelers. The sea provided a natural amphitheater, enhancing acoustics for large crowds. Teaching by the sea also fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee. This setting underscores Jesus' role as a teacher and His accessibility to the common people.<p><b>and such a large crowd gathered around Him</b><br>The large crowds indicate Jesus' growing popularity and the people's hunger for His teachings. This reflects the fulfillment of messianic expectations, as many believed the Messiah would draw multitudes. The crowd's size also highlights the impact of Jesus' miracles and teachings, which attracted people from various regions. This gathering foreshadows the diverse following Jesus would have, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a great multitude from every nation stands before the throne.<p><b>that He got into a boat and sat in it</b><br>Jesus using a boat as a pulpit demonstrates His adaptability and resourcefulness.

The shoreline setting symbolizes the boundary between the old covenant (land) and the new covenant (sea), with Jesus as the bridge.
