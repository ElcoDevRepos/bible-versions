This reflects Peter's impulsive nature and his prominent role among the Twelve. His direct communication with Jesus highlights the close relationship and trust between them. Peter's leadership is evident throughout the Gospels and the early church, as seen in Acts.<p><b>Rabbi,</b><br>The term "Rabbi" means "teacher" and is a title of respect. It indicates Peter's recognition of Jesus' authority and role as a spiritual leader. This title is used frequently in the Gospels, showing the disciples' acknowledgment of Jesus' teaching authority.<p><b>it is good for us to be here.</b><br>Peter expresses a sense of awe and privilege at witnessing the Transfiguration. This moment is a foretaste of the glory of the Kingdom of God. The statement reflects the human desire to remain in moments of divine revelation and glory, similar to the longing for God's presence seen in <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>.<p><b>Let us put up three shelters&#8212;</b><br>The suggestion to build shelters, or booths, may be linked to the Feast of Tabernacles, a Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness journey. This reflects Peter's desire to honor the moment and the figures present, though it also shows a misunderstanding of the temporary nature of the vision.<p><b>one for You,</b><br>Peter's inclusion of Jesus in the shelters indicates his recognition of Jesus' significance alongside Moses and Elijah. It underscores Jesus' fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets, as Moses represents the Law and Elijah the Prophets.<p><b>one for Moses,</b><br>Moses is a central figure in Jewish history, representing the Law given at Sinai. His presence at the Transfiguration signifies the continuity and fulfillment of the Law in Jesus. Moses' appearance connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where a prophet like Moses is promised.<p><b>and one for Elijah.</b><br>Elijah, a major prophet, is associated with the restoration of all things and the coming of the Messiah (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>). His presence at the Transfiguration symbolizes the prophetic witness to Jesus' messianic mission.

We learn from St. <a href="/luke/9-33.htm">Luke 9:33</a> that this happened just as Moses and Elijah were departing. Peter was excited, and there was fear mingled with his excitement. He was bewildered. His first idea was to seek that they might remain, for he saw that they were just preparing to depart. Theophylact says upon this, "Do not say with Peter, 'It is good for us to be here;' for it behoves us ever, whilst in the flesh, to be advancing, and not to remain in one stage of virtue and contemplation, but to pass on to other degrees" It is, perhaps, too curious a question to ask how the three disciples knew them to be Moses and Elijah. The same Divine power which presented them with a vision of the other world gave them an intuitive knowledge on the subject. And we may, perhaps, infer from hence that in that world to come there will be not only recognition, but knowledge, at once imparted, of those whose faces we have not seen "in the flesh." St. <a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a> says that Peter and his companions "were heavy with sleep (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>)." It is probable that the Transfiguration took place at night. The whole manifestation would be rendered more conspicuous and striking amidst the darkness and stillness of night. But St. Luke is careful to add, "when they were fully awake (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)." This word might be rendered, "having remained awake." But whichever translation be adopted, the intention of the evangelist is evidently to show that it was not in a dream or a vision of the night that they saw this. It was a great reality, on which they looked with open eyes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Peter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Petros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4074.htm">Strong's 4074: </a> </span><span class="str2">Peter, a Greek name meaning rock.
