In the cultural context of the time, hospitality was a significant social norm, and refusing to welcome someone was a serious breach of etiquette. The disciples were to preach the message of repentance and the coming of the Kingdom of God, and rejection of this message was tantamount to rejecting Jesus Himself. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who were often rejected by the people they were sent to (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-27</a>). The phrase also highlights the free will of individuals to accept or reject the gospel message.<p><b>shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place</b><br>This action was a symbolic gesture practiced by devout Jews when they returned from Gentile lands, signifying the removal of pagan defilement. By instructing His disciples to do this, Jesus was indicating that those who rejected the message were to be regarded as outsiders, akin to pagans. This act served as a public declaration that the disciples had fulfilled their duty and that the responsibility for rejecting the message lay with the hearers. It underscores the seriousness of rejecting the gospel and the separation between those who accept and those who reject God's message.<p><b>as a testimony against them.</b><br>The testimony here is both a warning and a witness. It serves as a warning of the consequences of rejecting the gospel, which is eternal separation from God. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of witness, where the actions and words of God's messengers serve as evidence of God's truth and justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, <a href="/acts/13-51.htm">Acts 13:51</a>). The disciples' act of shaking the dust off their feet would stand as a witness on the day of judgment, highlighting the accountability of those who heard the message and chose to reject it. This reflects the prophetic tradition where the prophets' words and actions served as a testimony against the people (<a href="/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this instruction, Jesus is sending out His disciples to preach the Gospel and perform miracles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' instruction, tasked with spreading His teachings and performing acts of healing and exorcism.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unwelcoming_towns/people.htm">Unwelcoming Towns/People</a></b><br>The recipients of the disciples' message who choose not to accept or listen to the Gospel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_shaking_dust.htm">The Act of Shaking Dust</a></b><br>A symbolic gesture of disassociation and a testimony against those who reject the message of Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_missionary_journey.htm">The Missionary Journey</a></b><br>The broader context of this passage, where Jesus sends out the Twelve to minister in various towns and villages.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rejecting_the_gospel.htm">The Seriousness of Rejecting the Gospel</a></b><br>The act of shaking the dust off one's feet underscores the gravity of rejecting the message of Christ.
