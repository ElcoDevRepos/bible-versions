Her role as the first messenger of the resurrection is significant, especially in a cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued. This highlights the transformative nature of the Gospel, where societal norms are upended. The phrase "those who had been with Him" refers to the disciples and followers of Jesus, who had been with Him throughout His ministry. This group was likely gathered in Jerusalem, as they had come there for the Passover. The act of going and telling is a precursor to the Great Commission, where the followers of Christ are instructed to spread the Gospel to all nations.<p><b>who were mourning and weeping</b><br>The disciples' mourning and weeping reflect their deep sorrow and despair following Jesus' crucifixion. This emotional state underscores their lack of understanding of Jesus' predictions about His resurrection, despite His clear teachings (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31, 9</a>:31, 10:34). Their grief also highlights the human aspect of the disciples, who, despite their close relationship with Jesus, struggled with doubt and fear. This moment of mourning is contrasted with the joy and hope that the resurrection brings, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>, which speak of the suffering servant who would ultimately bring healing and redemption. The transition from mourning to joy is a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, symbolizing the transformative power of Christ's victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
