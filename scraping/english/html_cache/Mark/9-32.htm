This reflects the spiritual blindness that can affect even those closest to Jesus. The statement in question refers to Jesus' prediction of His suffering, death, and resurrection, which He had just shared with them. This lack of understanding can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the prophet speaks of people who hear but do not understand. It also underscores the mystery of the Gospel, which is only fully revealed through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p><b>and they were afraid to ask Him about it</b><br>The disciples' fear to question Jesus further may stem from a combination of reverence, confusion, and previous rebukes. In <a href="/mark/8-33.htm">Mark 8:33</a>, Peter was sharply rebuked by Jesus for misunderstanding His mission, which could have contributed to their hesitance. This fear also reflects a cultural context where questioning a rabbi or teacher could be seen as disrespectful. Additionally, their fear might indicate an awareness of the gravity of Jesus' words, as they sensed the impending challenges and suffering that lay ahead. This moment foreshadows the disciples' eventual abandonment of Jesus during His arrest and crucifixion, highlighting their human frailty and the need for divine strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about His impending death and resurrection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are struggling to understand His teachings and are afraid to ask for clarification.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus and His disciples are traveling, a significant area for Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_requires_humility.htm">Understanding Requires Humility</a></b><br>The disciples' fear of asking questions highlights the importance of humility in seeking understanding.

They will kill Him, and after He has been killed, He will rise on the third day&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-31.htm">Mark 9:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Their confusion shows the disciples&#8217; expectation of a conquering Messiah, not a suffering One&#8212;despite <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a> and <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16-18</a>.<p>&#8226; Similar lack of comprehension surfaces in <a href="/luke/9-45.htm">Luke 9:45</a> and <a href="/luke/18-34.htm">Luke 18:34</a>, reminding us that spiritual truth often requires divine illumination (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, when Jesus spoke figuratively, they struggled too (<a href="/mark/4-13.htm">Mark 4:13</a>; <a href="/john/6-60.htm">John 6:60</a>). This pattern underscores human limitation apart from the Spirit&#8217;s work (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This statement</b><p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; words about His death and resurrection were not vague; they were direct and literal, just as earlier in <a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a> and later in <a href="/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33-34</a>.<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; misunderstanding was therefore not due to Jesus&#8217; ambiguity but to their preconceived ideas (cf. <a href="/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan of redemption was unfolding exactly as foretold (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>).

When Jesus calmed the storm, they &#8220;were terrified&#8221; (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>).

The verse invites us to trust Scripture&#8217;s accuracy, submit preconceived notions to God&#8217;s plan, and freely bring our questions to Christ, confident that He welcomes humble, faith-filled inquiry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">They understood not that saying.</span>--The words, giving once more a kind of psychological analysis of the disciples' thoughts, are not in St. Matthew, but are found in St. Luke.

They saw that something very dreadful was about to happen. Their Master's words and looks showed them this. But it was a mystery to them. All his words staggered them, but especially those which spoke of his rising again. They did not understand whether it was an entrance into a higher state or a restoration to a common life. They did not understand why he was to die, and how these words of his about his death could agree with those in which he had told them that his kingdom was at hand. Perhaps, on the whole, they inclined to the view most pleasing to them, that Christ would not die; for this was what they wished and most desired. And so they tried to persuade themselves that his words respecting his sufferings and death had some other hidden meaning; and were to be understood in a figurative sense and not a literal. But anyhow, they dreaded to ask him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they did not understand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#947;&#957;&#972;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;gnooun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_50.htm">Strong's 50: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do not know, be ignorant of, sometimes with the idea of willful ignorance. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
