This phrase emphasizes the importance of prayer in daily life and the posture of readiness and respect before God. Standing signifies alertness and reverence, indicating that prayer is an active engagement with God.<p><b>if you hold anything against another</b><br>This phrase highlights the relational aspect of faith, emphasizing the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness. In <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, Jesus teaches that reconciliation with others is a prerequisite for worship. Holding grudges or harboring resentment can hinder one's relationship with God and others, reflecting the biblical principle that love for God is intertwined with love for neighbor.<p><b>forgive it</b><br>Forgiveness is a central theme in Christian teaching, reflecting God's own nature as forgiving. In <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>, Jesus underscores the necessity of forgiving others to receive God's forgiveness. This act of forgiveness is not just a personal release but a reflection of divine grace, mirroring the forgiveness believers receive through Christ's sacrifice.<p><b>so that your Father in heaven will forgive your trespasses as well</b><br>This conditional statement underscores the reciprocal nature of forgiveness in the Christian faith. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and believers, where divine forgiveness is contingent upon one's willingness to forgive others. This principle is echoed in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>) and illustrates the transformative power of grace, urging believers to embody the forgiveness they have received.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instruction on prayer and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek to follow His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_in_heaven.htm">Father in Heaven</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His role as a forgiving Father.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, a central practice in the life of a believer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness.htm">Forgiveness</a></b><br>The act of pardoning someone for an offense, a key theme in Jesus' teaching.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_forgiveness_in_prayer.htm">The Necessity of Forgiveness in Prayer</a></b><br>Forgiveness is a prerequisite for effective prayer.

The reproduction of the words which are recorded as having been spoken in the Sermon on the Mount, is very significant. The prayer even of intensest faith is not perfect, unless the temper of the worshipper is also that of the Charity which forgives offences. Such words exclude from the prayers of Christ's disciples wishes more or less vindictive, which, as in Psalms 69, 109, had seemed natural and right under a less perfect manifestation of the will and mind of the Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And wheresoever ye stand praying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The ordinary attitude of Eastern nations in prayer is here indicated, namely, "standing," with the head, doubtless, bowed in reverence. The promise of this text is that requests offered in prayer by a faithful heart will be granted - granted as God knows best. The connection of these verses with the former is close. One great hindrance to the faith without which there can be no spiritual power, is the presence of angry and uncharitable feelings. These must all be put away if we would hope for a favorable answer from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/11-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
