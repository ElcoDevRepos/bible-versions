This command is part of what scholars refer to as the "Messianic Secret," a theme in the Gospel of Mark where Jesus often tells people not to disclose His identity or works. This could be to prevent misunderstandings about His mission, as many expected a political Messiah who would overthrow Roman rule. By keeping His identity concealed, Jesus could focus on His teaching and healing ministry without the interference of political or social agendas. This command also reflects Jesus' humility and His desire to fulfill His mission according to God's timing, not human expectations.<p><b>But the more He ordered them,</b><br>Despite Jesus' clear instructions, the people who witnessed His miracles found it difficult to remain silent. This reflects the profound impact of Jesus' works and the natural human tendency to share extraordinary experiences. The repeated nature of Jesus' command suggests that He was serious about maintaining discretion, yet it also highlights the challenge of controlling the spread of such news. This tension between Jesus' instructions and the people's actions underscores the compelling nature of His ministry and the difficulty of containing the excitement it generated.<p><b>the more widely they proclaimed it.</b><br>The people's disobedience in spreading the news of Jesus' miracles demonstrates the irresistible nature of His works and the deep impression they left on those who witnessed them. This widespread proclamation, despite Jesus' orders, contributed to His growing popularity and the increasing attention from both the public and religious authorities. It also foreshadows the Great Commission, where Jesus later instructs His disciples to spread the Gospel to all nations. The enthusiasm of the people in proclaiming Jesus' deeds can be seen as a precursor to the evangelistic mission of the early church, highlighting the transformative power of encountering Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing miracles and teaching, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>Those who witnessed Jesus' miracles and were instructed by Him not to spread the news, yet they did so with increasing fervor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/decapolis.htm">Decapolis</a></b><br>The region where this event takes place, a group of ten cities with a significant Gentile population, highlighting the spread of Jesus' ministry beyond Jewish territories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_paradox_of_silence_and_proclamation.htm">The Paradox of Silence and Proclamation</a></b><br>Jesus often instructed silence to avoid premature fame or misunderstanding of His mission.

In Greek narrative flow, Mark highlights Jesus &#8220;strongly&#8221; charging them, not casually mentioning it (cf. <a href="/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>; 9:9).<p>&#8226; This persistent command contrasts sharply with the crowds&#8217; growing excitement, exposing a tension between divine timing and human enthusiasm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the more widely they proclaimed it</b><p>&#8226; Human nature tends to share good news&#8212;especially personal deliverance&#8212;even when told not to (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a> illustrates the apostles later saying, &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The healed man&#8217;s testimony spread &#8220;all the more,&#8221; fanning regional awareness of Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-28.htm">Mark 1:28</a>).

Despite His clear orders, grateful beneficiaries could not contain their testimony, illustrating both the irrepressible joy of salvation and the ongoing tension between divine timetable and human impulse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36, 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He charged them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). The word is a strong one: "he gave them clear and positive orders." The injunction seems to have been given, both to the deaf and dumb man, and to those who brought him. And it was given partly, no doubt, for his own sake, and for reasons connected with his gradual manifestation of himself to the world, and partly for the instruction of his disciples, and to show that he did not desire by his miracles to win the vain applause of men. St. Augustine says that "our Lord desired, by putting this restraint upon them, to teach how much more fervently they ought to preach him, whom he commissions to preach, when they who were forbidden could not be silent." <span class="cmt_word">He hath done all things well</span>. He did nothing that the Pharisees, captious and envious as they were, could reasonably find fault with. St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/15-30.htm">Matthew 15:30, 31</a>) intimates that at this time our Lord exhibited a vast number of miracles, a bright galaxy of wonders, amongst which this shone out conspicuously, as a very prominent and instructive one. But, indeed, "he went about doing good." His whole life on earth was one connected, continued manifestation of loving kindness. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] ordered</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(diesteilato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1291.htm">Strong's 1291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give a commission (instructions), order; To admonish, prohibit. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
