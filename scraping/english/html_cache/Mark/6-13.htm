In the context of the Gospels, demon possession was a significant issue, and Jesus frequently demonstrated His power over evil spirits. The disciples' ability to drive out demons is a testament to the authority and power of Jesus being extended to His followers. This act also fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah bringing liberation and freedom from spiritual bondage, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. The casting out of demons signifies the in-breaking of God's kingdom and the defeat of Satan's power.<p><b>and healed many of the sick</b><br>Healing the sick was a central aspect of Jesus' ministry, demonstrating His compassion and divine authority. The disciples' ability to heal in Jesus' name shows the continuation of His work and the validation of their mission. This healing ministry fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which speaks of the suffering servant bearing our sicknesses. The act of healing also serves as a sign of the coming kingdom of God, where there will be no more sickness or pain.<p><b>anointing them with oil</b><br>Anointing with oil has historical and cultural significance in Jewish tradition. Oil was used for medicinal purposes, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>), and for religious rituals, symbolizing the presence and blessing of God. In this context, the use of oil by the disciples may have served as a tangible expression of God's healing power and the Holy Spirit's presence. <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a> later instructs the church to anoint the sick with oil in the name of the Lord, indicating a continued practice of seeking divine healing through faith and prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The twelve apostles sent out by Jesus to preach, heal, and cast out demons.

It was partly analogous to our Lord's treatment of the blind and deaf (<a href="/mark/7-33.htm" title="And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="/mark/8-23.htm" title="And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands on him, he asked him if he saw ought.">Mark 8:23</a>; <a href="/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>), i.e., it was an outward sign showing the wish to heal, and therefore a help to faith; but as the use of oil was more distinctly that of an agent recognised as remedial in the popular therapeutics of the time, it had also the character of uniting (and devout minds have since so regarded it) the use of natural outward means of healing with prayer for the divine blessing. It need scarcely be said that it had not the slightest affinity with the mediaeval so-called sacrament of extreme unction, which, though it may still retain, in theory, a partial secondary connection with the cure of the diseases of the body, is practically never administered till all hope of cure is abandoned. The development of the latter aspect of the usage was obviously the after-growth of a later time, when the miraculous gift of healing was withdrawn, and when it became necessary to devise a theory for the retention of the practice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them</span>. It is hardly possible to separate this from the reference to the use of oil for the sick, in <a href="/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>. Unction was employed extensively in ancient times for medicinal purposes. It is recorded of Herod the Great by Josephus ('Antiq.,' 17:6, 5) that in one of his sicknesses he was "immersed in a bath full of oil," from which he is said to have derived much benefit. The apostles used it, no doubt not only on account of its supposed remedial virtues, but also as an outward and visible sign that the healing was effected by their instrumentality in the name of Christ, and perhaps also because the oil itself was significant of God's mercy, of spiritual comfort and joy" the oil of gladness." Neither this passage nor that in St. James can properly be adduced to support the ceremony of "extreme unction;" for in both these cases the result was that the sick were restored to health. The so-called sacrament of" extreme unction "is administered immediately before death, when the sick person is <span class="accented">in articulo morris.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They also drove out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#941;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(exeballon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1544.htm">Strong's 1544: </a> </span><span class="str2">To throw (cast, put) out; I banish; I bring forth, produce.
