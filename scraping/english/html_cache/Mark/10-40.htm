The right and left seats symbolize positions of power and prestige, often reserved for the most trusted and honored individuals. In ancient royal courts, sitting at the right hand of a king was a place of highest honor, indicating authority and closeness to the ruler. This request reflects a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission, as His kingdom is not of this world (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>). The disciples are still thinking in terms of earthly power structures, not the servant leadership Jesus exemplifies.<p><b>is not Mine to grant.</b><br>Jesus acknowledges His submission to the Father's will, emphasizing the divine order and the sovereignty of God in determining roles and positions in His kingdom. This statement highlights the Trinitarian relationship where the Son submits to the Father&#8217;s authority. It also reflects the humility of Christ, who, though equal with God, does not grasp at power but submits to the Father&#8217;s plan (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>). This phrase teaches about the nature of divine authority and the importance of seeking God's will above personal ambition.<p><b>These seats belong to those</b><br>This indicates that positions of honor in God's kingdom are predetermined by divine wisdom and purpose. It suggests that God has a specific plan for each individual, and roles are assigned according to His sovereign will. This aligns with the biblical theme that God has prepared good works for believers to walk in (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). It underscores the idea that human ambition cannot alter God's divine plan.<p><b>for whom they have been prepared.&#8221;</b><br>The preparation of these seats implies a divine foreknowledge and predestination, consistent with the biblical teaching that God has a plan for history and for individual lives (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>). This preparation is not based on human merit but on God's grace and purpose. It reflects the biblical principle that God exalts the humble and brings down the proud (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). This phrase reassures believers that God&#8217;s plans are perfect and that He prepares roles and rewards according to His perfect wisdom and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, responding to a request from James and John about positions of honor in His kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_and_john.htm">James and John</a></b><br>The sons of Zebedee, two of Jesus' disciples, who asked for positions of honor in Jesus' glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The group of Jesus' followers who were present during this teaching moment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The spiritual realm over which God reigns, and the focus of Jesus' teachings and mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prepared_seats.htm">The Prepared Seats</a></b><br>Symbolic of the places of honor in God's kingdom, determined by God's sovereign will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sovereignty_of_god.htm">Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God's authority and sovereignty determine the roles and honors in His kingdom, not human ambition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_servanthood.htm">Humility and Servanthood</a></b><br>True greatness in God's kingdom is found in humility and serving others, following Jesus' example.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_and_faithfulness.htm">Preparedness and Faithfulness</a></b><br>Believers are called to be faithful and prepared for the roles God has assigned them, trusting in His perfect plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focus on eternal rewards and God's purposes rather than earthly recognition and status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Trust that God has a specific plan and purpose for each believer, and that His preparation is perfect.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_10_40_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 10:40?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_40_Jesus_submits_to_God_s_will.htm">How does Mark 10:40 illustrate Jesus' submission to the Father's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_40_on_God_s_role_assignment.htm">What does Mark 10:40 teach about God's sovereignty in assigning roles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jesus_humility_from_Mark_10_40.htm">How can we apply Jesus' humility in Mark 10:40 to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_40_Phil_2_5-8_Christ_s_humility.htm">How does Mark 10:40 connect with Philippians 2:5-8 on Christ's humility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_40_s_impact_on_leadership.htm">How should Mark 10:40 influence our understanding of leadership and servanthood?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_10_40_on_God_s_sovereignty.htm">What does Mark 10:40 reveal about God's sovereignty in assigning places of honor in heaven?

Our task is simple: serve humbly, remain faithful, and trust the One who has prepared every reward long before we even began the race.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">But it shall be given to them.</span>--Better, omitting the interpolated words, <span class= "ital">is not Mine to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared.</span> Our Lord disclaims, not the power to give, but that of giving arbitrarily, otherwise than His Father willed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for them for whom it hath been prepared</span>. The Arians gathered from this that our Lord was not of one substance with the Father. But this arose from a misunderstanding of the words. For the antithesis is not here between Christ and the Father; but between James and John on the one side ambitiously seeking the pre-eminence, and those on the ether side to whom it ought of right to be given. St. Jerome wisely says, "Our Lord does not say, 'Ye shall not sit,' lest he should put to shame these two. Neither does he say, 'Ye shall sit,' lest the others should be envious. But by holding out the prize to all, he animates all to contend for it." Our Lord is also careful to point out that he who humbles himself shall be exalted. But Christ is the Giver, not indeed by way of favor to any one who asks, but according to the eternal and unalterable principles laid down by the Father. That Christ is the Giver is plain from St. Luke (<a href="/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29</a>). "I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to sit</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(kathisai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2523.htm">Strong's 2523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Another form for kathezomai; to seat down, i.e. Set; intransitively, to sit; figuratively, to settle.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
