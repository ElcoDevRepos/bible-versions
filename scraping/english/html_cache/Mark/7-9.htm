In the context of <a href="/mark/7.htm">Mark 7</a>, Jesus is responding to their criticism of His disciples for not following traditional handwashing rituals. This setting is significant as it highlights the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>You neatly set aside the command of God</b><br>Here, Jesus accuses the religious leaders of prioritizing human traditions over divine commandments. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus challenges the legalism and hypocrisy of the Pharisees. The "command of God" refers to the Mosaic Law, which was given to guide the Israelites in their covenant relationship with God. Jesus emphasizes the importance of adhering to God's commands rather than human interpretations or additions.<p><b>to maintain your own tradition</b><br>The "tradition" mentioned here refers to the oral laws and customs developed by Jewish leaders over centuries, which were not part of the original Torah. These traditions often became burdensome and overshadowed the core teachings of Scripture. Jesus criticizes the leaders for valuing these traditions over the true intent of God's law. This critique is consistent with other Gospel passages where Jesus calls for a return to the heart of God's commandments, such as in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-24</a>, where He emphasizes justice, mercy, and faithfulness over ritualistic practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and scribes, challenging their adherence to human traditions over God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who were known for their strict observance of the law and traditions.

Now He presses the point further.<p>&#8226; The shift from &#8220;He replied&#8221; (v. 6) to &#8220;He went on to say&#8221; shows that the Lord is not finished; He is deliberately driving His warning home, much like His extended rebuke in <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13-33</a>.<p>&#8226; By continuing the conversation, Jesus models the patience of God, &#8220;not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You neatly set aside</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Neatly&#8221; highlights the Pharisees&#8217; calculated approach.
