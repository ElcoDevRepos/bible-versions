They were influential in the synagogues and among the common people. The Herodians, on the other hand, were a political group that supported the Herodian dynasty, which was aligned with Roman rule. The collaboration between these two groups is significant because they typically had opposing views; the Pharisees were generally anti-Roman, while the Herodians supported Roman authority. Their alliance here indicates the seriousness of their intent to challenge Jesus, as they were willing to set aside their differences to confront a common perceived threat.<p><b>to catch Jesus in His words</b><br>The phrase "to catch" suggests a trap or a snare, indicating malicious intent. The goal was to find a reason to accuse Jesus, either religiously or politically, to discredit Him or bring Him under Roman scrutiny. This reflects the growing tension between Jesus and the religious leaders, who felt threatened by His teachings and popularity. The use of words as a means of entrapment highlights the wisdom and discernment required by Jesus to navigate these challenges. This scenario is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's servants faced traps, such as Daniel in the lion's den (Daniel 6) or the attempts to trap Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>).

On this occasion they enlisted the Heredians to join them in their attack upon him. These Herodians were a sect of the Jews who supported the house of Herod, and were in favor of giving tribute to the Roman Caesar. They were so called at first from Herod the Great, who was a great supporter of Caesar. Tertullian, St. Jerome, and others say that these Herodiaus thought that Herod was the promised Messiah, because they saw that in him the scepter had departed from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). Herod encouraged these flatterers, and so put to death the infants at Bethlehem, that he might thus get rid of Christ, lest any other than himself might be regarded as Christ. They said at it was on this account that he rebuilt the temple with so much magnificence. The Pharisees took, of course, altogether the other side, and stood forward as the supporters of the Law of Moses and of their national freedom. So, in order that they might ensnare him, they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, and in the most artful manner proposed to him, apparently in good faith, a question which answer it how he might, would, as they hoped, throw him upon the horns of a dilemma. If he said that tribute ought to be given to Caesar, he would expose himself to the malice of the Jewish people, who prided themselves upon their freedom. If, on the other hand, he said that tribute ought not to be given to Caesar, he would incur the wrath of Caesar and of the Roman power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Later,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they sent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apostellousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_649.htm">Strong's 649: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and stello; set apart, i.e. to send out literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tinas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
