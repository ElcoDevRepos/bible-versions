This act demonstrates the women's intention to care for Jesus' body, reflecting their love and respect for Him. It also highlights the urgency and immediacy of their actions following the Sabbath.<p><b>so they could go and anoint the body of Jesus</b><br>Anointing was a significant ritual in Jewish burial customs, symbolizing respect and mourning. The women's intention to anoint Jesus' body shows their devotion and belief in His significance, even in death.

They had "brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight" (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>).
