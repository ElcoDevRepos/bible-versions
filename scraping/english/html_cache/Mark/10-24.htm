In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, wealth was often seen as a blessing from God, and the rich were considered more likely to be righteous. This teaching follows Jesus' encounter with the rich young ruler, where He emphasizes the difficulty for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God. The disciples' reaction indicates their struggle to understand this reversal of expectations, highlighting the radical nature of Jesus' message.<p><b>But Jesus said to them again,</b><br>Jesus' repetition underscores the importance of His teaching. In Jewish tradition, repetition is a common method to emphasize a point. By addressing the disciples again, Jesus ensures they grasp the significance of His message. This also reflects His patience and willingness to teach His followers, who often struggled to comprehend His teachings fully.<p><b>&#8220;Children,</b><br>The term "children" is a term of endearment and indicates a close, familial relationship between Jesus and His disciples. It suggests a level of care and concern, as well as a recognition of their need for guidance and instruction. In the broader biblical context, believers are often referred to as children of God, emphasizing their dependence on Him and their need for His guidance.<p><b>how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</b><br>This statement highlights the spiritual challenge of entering God's kingdom, which requires humility, faith, and a willingness to forsake earthly attachments. The kingdom of God is a central theme in Jesus' teaching, representing God's sovereign rule and the fulfillment of His promises. This difficulty is not due to God's unwillingness to accept people but rather the human tendency to rely on wealth, status, or personal merit. Jesus' teaching here aligns with other scriptures that emphasize the need for a heart transformation and reliance on God's grace, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, where the poor in spirit are blessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the challenges of entering the kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are present and listening to His teachings.

There is, however, good reason for thinking, as they are wanting in the best MSS., that they were added by some one who sought to tone down the words of warning to what seemed a rational medium. Omitting the doubtful words, the sentence runs, "How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!"--hard alike for rich and poor, though, as the words that follow show, it was hardest for the former.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the disciples were astonished</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) - literally, <span class="accented">were amazed <span class="cmt_word"></span>at his words</span>. The Greek word here implies wilderment. It is used again below at ver. 32. We find it also at <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>. This doctrine of our Lord was so new and strange to them. They had been accustomed to think little of the danger, and much of the advances of wealth. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them<span class="cmt_word">, Children how hard is it for them that trust in riches</span> <span class="cmt_word">enter into the kingdom of God!</span> He the enduring expression of "children" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). He and takes off somewhat of the edge of the seventy of the expression, by changing the form of it into the words," how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" There is some authority for omitting the words. "for them that trot in riches;" so to reduce the sentence to the simple form, "How hard is it to enter into the kingdom of God!" Such is the reading in the two great uncial manuscripts, the Sinaitic and the Vatican. But on the whole the balance of evidence is in favor of that which was adopted in the Authorized Version, and has been retained by the Revisers of 1881; and it is reasonable to believe that our Lord qualified the former expression, in order to relieve the minds of his amazed disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
