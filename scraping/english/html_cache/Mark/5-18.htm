The setting is near the Sea of Galilee, a significant location in Jesus' ministry. The boat symbolizes both a literal and metaphorical vehicle for Jesus' mission, often used to cross boundaries and reach new audiences. This moment follows the dramatic exorcism of the demon-possessed man, showcasing Jesus' authority over evil spirits.<p><b>the man who had been possessed by the demons</b><br>This refers to the man previously tormented by a legion of demons, highlighting the transformative power of Jesus' intervention. The man's condition before meeting Jesus was dire, living among the tombs and unable to be restrained. His deliverance is a testament to Jesus' compassion and power, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of setting captives free. The man's restoration to sanity and community reflects the holistic salvation Jesus offers.<p><b>begged to go with Him</b><br>The man's request to accompany Jesus underscores his gratitude and desire for discipleship. It reflects a common response to Jesus' miracles, where those healed or delivered wish to follow Him. This plea also highlights the personal relationship Jesus establishes with those He touches. However, Jesus often redirects such desires, as seen in the following verses, emphasizing the importance of witnessing to one's own community. This aligns with the Great Commission, where believers are called to share their testimony and the gospel with others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who has just performed a miraculous healing by casting out demons from a man in the region of the Gerasenes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_had_been_demon-possessed.htm">The Man Who Had Been Demon-Possessed</a></b><br>Previously tormented by a legion of demons, this man is now healed and desires to follow Jesus as a disciple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>Represents the means by which Jesus and His disciples traveled across the Sea of Galilee, and from which Jesus is about to depart.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_of_the_gerasenes.htm">The Region of the Gerasenes</a></b><br>A Gentile area on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee where the event takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are present with Jesus and are part of the broader account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/desire_to_follow_jesus.htm">Desire to Follow Jesus</a></b><br>The healed man's request to accompany Jesus reflects a natural response to experiencing Christ's transformative power.
