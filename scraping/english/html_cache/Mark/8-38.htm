In the context of the Roman Empire, where Christians faced persecution, being ashamed of Jesus could mean denying Him to avoid suffering. This echoes Jesus' earlier teachings in <a href="/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32-33</a> about confessing Him before others. The "words" of Jesus refer to His teachings, which were countercultural and often challenged the religious and social norms of the time.<p><b>in this adulterous and sinful generation</b><br>The term "adulterous" is often used in the Old Testament to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (e.g., <a href="/hosea/3.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). Here, it signifies spiritual unfaithfulness and moral corruption. The "sinful generation" refers to the people of Jesus' time who rejected His message and were entrenched in sin. This reflects the broader biblical theme of humanity's rebellion against God, as seen in passages like <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a> and <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>.<p><b>the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him</b><br>"Son of Man" is a title Jesus frequently used for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a divine figure with authority and glory. The phrase indicates a future judgment where Jesus will deny those who denied Him. This is consistent with the eschatological themes in the Gospels, where Jesus speaks of separating the faithful from the unfaithful (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>when He comes in His Father&#8217;s glory</b><br>This refers to the Second Coming of Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. "His Father's glory" signifies divine majesty and authority, as seen in Old Testament theophanies (e.g., <a href="/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16-17</a>). The return of Christ is depicted as a time of ultimate vindication and fulfillment of God's promises, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>.<p><b>with the holy angels</b><br>The presence of "holy angels" underscores the divine nature of Christ's return and His authority over the heavenly hosts. Angels are often depicted as God's messengers and agents of His will, as seen in <a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13-14</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11-12</a>.

The Second Coming is literal, visible, majestic. <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>: &#8220;For the Son of Man will come in His Father&#8217;s glory with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to what he has done.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Father&#8217;s glory is the radiance of divine holiness; Christ will share and display it fully (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a> calls believers to live &#8220;while we wait for the blessed hope&#8212;the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.&#8221; Anticipation fuels faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the holy angels</b><p>&#8226; Angels accompany the King as His royal court and as agents of judgment (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a> pictures the scene: &#8220;When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, He will sit on His glorious throne.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their presence highlights the cosmic scale of the event; allegiance to Christ is no minor private matter but the decisive issue of the universe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a> is Jesus&#8217; sober call to courageous allegiance. In a culture marked by spiritual infidelity, disciples must openly own His name and His teaching. The stakes are eternal: our present confession or denial determines His future confession or denial of us at His glorious return with the angelic host. Faithful boldness now secures honor then; silence now invites shame then. Stand with Him today, and He will stand with you forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Whosoever therefore.</span>--Here St. Mark differs from St. Matthew, who omits these words, and agrees, though not quite verbally, with St. Luke. It is obvious that general as the words are, they had a special bearing on those who, like Peter, and probably the other disciples, had shown that they were "ashamed" of the words which had just been spoken.<p><span class= "bld">This adulterous and sinful generation.</span>--The words are not found in St. Luke's report, but they agree with language which our Lord had used before (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-4.htm" title="A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.">Matthew 16:4</a>). Their force here lies in the contrast drawn between those from whose frown or scorn the disciples were now shrinking, and the bright hosts in whose presence the faithless should be put to shame when the Son of Man should come in His glory. They were to look on this picture and on that, and ask themselves which ordeal was the most terrible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - Our Lord here looks onward to the day of judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be ashamed of me</span>. "Whosoever:" the word includes all, whatever their position or circumstances may be. "Shall be ashamed of me;" that is, shall deny my faith, or blush to confess me here. <span class="cmt_word">Of him shall the Son of man be ashamed</span>; that is, Christ will despise him, when he shall appear with power and great glory, in that sublime majesty which he gained by his death upon the cross. <span class="cmt_word">In this adulterous and sinful</span> <span class="cmt_word">generation.</span> It adds to the disgrace of being ashamed of Christ that the shame is manifested in the presence of the base and the worthless; and therefore our Lord exhibits the contrast between the mean and contemptible people in the presence of whom men are ashamed of him here, and the magnificent assemblage in whose presence he will be ashamed of them hereafter. The cross of Christ appeared to the great body of mankind to be shameful and contemptible. To the Jews it was a stumbling-block, and to the Greek's foolishness. Hence vast numbers, whether through shame or fear, did not dare to confess it, and still less to preach it. And therefore it is that St. Paul says (<a href="/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>:l6), "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
