Mocking was a common practice to humiliate those condemned, especially in the case of someone claiming to be a king. The soldiers' mockery included dressing Jesus in a purple robe and placing a crown of thorns on His head, symbolizing a false kingship. This act fulfilled the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, who was "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>they removed the purple robe</b><br>The purple robe was a symbol of royalty, used here sarcastically to mock Jesus' claim to be the King of the Jews. Purple dye was expensive and associated with wealth and power, making this act particularly derisive. The removal of the robe signifies the end of the mock coronation and the transition to the grim reality of crucifixion.<p><b>and put His own clothes back on Him</b><br>Returning Jesus' own clothes to Him was a practical step before leading Him to crucifixion, as Roman law required the condemned to be crucified in their own garments. This act also highlights the stripping away of any false honor given during the mockery, returning Jesus to His humble state. It underscores His role as the suffering servant, who bore humiliation and shame.<p><b>Then they led Him out to crucify Him</b><br>This phrase marks the beginning of the final journey to Golgotha, the place of crucifixion. The act of leading Jesus out of the city aligns with the Old Testament sacrificial system, where the sin offering was taken outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>). This fulfills the typology of Jesus as the ultimate sin offering, bearing the sins of the world. The crucifixion itself was a Roman method of execution reserved for the most serious offenders, emphasizing the depth of Jesus' humiliation and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, who is being mocked and prepared for crucifixion.
