The "strong man" represents a figure of authority or power, often interpreted as Satan in the context of Jesus' ministry. The "house" symbolizes the domain or realm under the strong man's control. In the cultural context of the time, a house was a place of security and authority, and entering it without permission was a significant violation. This imagery would resonate with Jesus' audience, who understood the importance of household protection.<p><b>to steal his possessions</b><br>The possessions refer to what the strong man holds dear or has control over. In the spiritual context, this can be seen as the souls or lives under Satan's influence. The act of stealing implies a transfer of ownership or liberation from the current possessor. This aligns with Jesus' mission to free those oppressed by evil and bring them into the kingdom of God. The concept of spiritual warfare is evident here, as Jesus challenges the authority of evil.<p><b>unless he first ties up the strong man</b><br>Tying up the strong man signifies the necessity of overcoming or subduing the power of evil before liberation can occur. This reflects Jesus' authority over demonic forces, as demonstrated in His exorcisms and miracles. The act of binding is a common biblical motif for rendering an enemy powerless, seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>, where Satan is bound for a thousand years. This phrase emphasizes the prerequisite of divine power to conquer evil.<p><b>Then he can plunder his house</b><br>Plundering the house indicates the act of reclaiming or rescuing what was once under the strong man's control. In the context of Jesus' ministry, this represents the redemption and salvation of individuals from the grip of sin and Satan. The imagery of plundering suggests a victorious and decisive action, highlighting Jesus' role as the conqueror of evil. This connects to prophecies of the Messiah as a deliverer, such as in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the anointed one proclaims freedom for the captives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus uses this illustration to explain His authority over demonic forces and to refute accusations from the Pharisees that He is casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/strong_man.htm">Strong Man</a></b><br>Represents Satan or demonic forces.
