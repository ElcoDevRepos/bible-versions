The Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake in northern Israel, serves as a backdrop for many of Jesus' teachings and miracles. It was a central location for His ministry, providing a natural amphitheater for large crowds. The act of withdrawing also highlights Jesus' intentionality in His ministry, balancing public teaching with private instruction to His disciples.<p><b>accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea</b><br>The mention of a large crowd underscores Jesus' growing popularity and the widespread impact of His ministry. Galilee, where Jesus spent much of His time, was a region known for its diverse population and openness to new ideas, contrasting with the more conservative Judea. The presence of people from both regions indicates the broad appeal of Jesus' message and the hope He inspired among different groups.

This shows that the miracle just recorded took place in the interior of Galilee, and not at Capernaum, which was close by the sea. The chief city in Galilee at that time was Sepphoris, which Herod Antipas had made his capital. There the Herodiaus would of course be numerous, and so too would the Pharisees; since that city was one of the five places where the five Sanhedrims met (see Reland, 'Palestine,' p. 100, referred to in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in lee.</span>). The remainder of these two verses should be read and pointed thus: <span class="cmt_word">And a great multitude from Galilee followed: and from Judaea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, come unto him</span>. The meaning of the evangelist is this, that, in addition to the great multitude that followed him from the parts of Galilee which he had just been visiting, there were vast numbers from other parts who had now heard of his fame, and flocked to him from every quarter. This description sets before us in a strikingly graphic manner the mixed character of the multitude who gathered around our Lord to listen to his teaching, and to be healed by him - as many, at least, as had need of healing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">withdrew</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#974;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anech&#333;r&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_402.htm">Strong's 402: </a> </span><span class="str2">From ana and choreo; to retire.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
