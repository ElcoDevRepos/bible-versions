The crowd consisted of men, women, and children, indicating a large number of people. This miracle demonstrates Jesus' compassion and His divine ability to provide abundantly. It echoes the Old Testament provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), showing Jesus as the greater Moses who provides for His people. The act of eating together also signifies fellowship and community, a theme prevalent in Jesus' ministry.<p><b>and were satisfied</b><br>The satisfaction of the crowd highlights the completeness of Jesus' provision. In a cultural context where food scarcity was common, this miracle would have been particularly impactful. It signifies not only physical nourishment but also spiritual fulfillment, pointing to Jesus as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). This satisfaction contrasts with the temporary fulfillment offered by the world, emphasizing the eternal satisfaction found in Christ.

It is probable that the women and children were a considerable number; for they would be, if possible, even more eager then the men to see the great Prophet. When all had eaten and were satisfied, <span class="cmt_word">they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and also of the fishes.</span> St. John tells us that this was done by the express command of Christ (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12</a>); and the existence of these fragments, far more in quantity than the original supply, was a striking testimony to the reality of the miracle, and that there was enough and more than enough for all. It does not become us to pry too curiously into the method of our Lord's working; but the number of these baskets (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), namely, twelve, seems to suggest that he first broke the loaves, and in breaking multiplied them, and distributed them into these baskets, one for each apostle, and that the food, as it was distributed by the disciples, was more and more multiplied, as needed, so that at length they brought back to Christ as many basketfuls of fragments as they had first received from him, and much more than the original supply. It is obvious here to remark that by this stupendous miracle our Lord showed himself to be the true Bread of life, by which the spiritual wants of all hungering souls may be supplied. "For," says St. Augustine," he was the Word of God, and all the acts of the Word are themselves words for us. They are not as pictures, merely, to look at and admire; but as letters which we must seek to read and understand." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{They} all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
