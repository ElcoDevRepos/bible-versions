In Jewish tradition, Elijah is expected to come as a forerunner to the Messiah, preparing the way for His arrival. Jesus affirms this expectation, indicating that Elijah's role is to restore and prepare. In the New Testament context, John the Baptist is seen as fulfilling this role (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>, <a href="/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2-4</a>), coming in the "spirit and power of Elijah" (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>) to call Israel to repentance and readiness for the Messiah's coming. The restoration mentioned here is spiritual, calling people back to God and His covenant.<p><b>Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?</b><br>This question highlights the paradox of the Messiah's mission, which includes suffering and rejection, contrary to popular Jewish expectations of a triumphant political deliverer. The phrase "Son of Man" is a messianic title from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, emphasizing both humanity and divine authority. Jesus points to the prophetic scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which foretell the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. This suffering is necessary for the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, as it leads to the atonement for sin and the ultimate victory over death. Jesus uses this question to teach His disciples about the true nature of His mission, which involves humility, sacrifice, and eventual glorification.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful ministry and miracles.
