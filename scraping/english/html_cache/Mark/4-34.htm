This approach was common in Jewish teaching, allowing listeners to engage with the narrative and uncover deeper meanings. Parables served to reveal truths to those open to understanding while concealing them from those who were not receptive (<a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13-15</a>). This method fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, where it is said that the Messiah would speak in parables. Parables also reflect the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Proverbs, which uses everyday situations to convey moral and spiritual lessons.<p><b>But privately He explained everything to His own disciples.</b><br>Jesus provided His disciples with deeper insights into the parables, highlighting the importance of spiritual discernment and the role of the Holy Spirit in understanding divine truths (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). This private instruction underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His disciples, preparing them for their future roles as leaders of the early Church. It also reflects the pattern of rabbinic teaching, where a rabbi would offer deeper explanations to his close followers. This practice ensured that the disciples were equipped to teach others and spread the Gospel effectively, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early Christians devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowds using parables and later explaining them to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>- The close followers of Jesus who receive private explanations of the parables.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowds.htm">Crowds</a></b><br>- The larger group of people who listen to Jesus' teachings in parables but do not receive the private explanations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/parables.htm">Parables</a></b><br>- A teaching method used by Jesus, involving simple accounts with deeper spiritual meanings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/private_explanation.htm">Private Explanation</a></b><br>- The act of Jesus explaining the deeper meanings of parables to His disciples in private.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_parables.htm">The Purpose of Parables</a></b><br>Parables serve to reveal and conceal truth, depending on the spiritual receptivity of the listener.
