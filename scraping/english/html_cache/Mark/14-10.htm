His surname, "Iscariot," likely indicates his origin from Kerioth, a town in Judea, distinguishing him from the other disciples who were mostly from Galilee. Judas's role as the betrayer is prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend who would turn against the Messiah. His actions fulfill these prophecies, highlighting the sovereignty of God even in human betrayal.<p><b>one of the Twelve</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the closeness and trust Judas had as part of Jesus' inner circle. The Twelve were chosen by Jesus to be His apostles, given authority, and entrusted with His teachings. Judas's betrayal is particularly poignant because it comes from within this trusted group, illustrating the theme of betrayal by a close associate, which is a recurring motif in biblical narratives.<p><b>went to the chief priests</b><br>The chief priests were influential leaders in the Jewish religious hierarchy, responsible for temple worship and maintaining religious law. They were part of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council that sought to maintain order and their own power under Roman occupation. Judas's approach to them indicates a premeditated decision to betray Jesus, aligning with the religious leaders' growing hostility towards Jesus, who they saw as a threat to their authority and the status quo.<p><b>to betray Jesus to them</b><br>The act of betrayal is central to the Passion narrative. Judas's decision to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, as detailed in <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>, fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a> regarding the price of betrayal. This act sets in motion the events leading to Jesus' arrest, trial, and crucifixion. Judas's betrayal is a stark contrast to Jesus' faithfulness and sacrifice, serving as a reminder of human sinfulness and the need for redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus.

Jesus praised the woman for her costly devotion, while some disciples, led by Judas (<a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-6</a>), complained about the &#8220;waste.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: immediately after a public act of love, we see a private resolve to betray. Matthew records the same sequence: &#8220;Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Timing matters. Jesus had just spoken of His burial (<a href="/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>). Judas, unmoved by the warning of imminent death, moves instead toward treachery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judas Iscariot</b><p>&#8226; Mark identifies the betrayer by name. Judas had been chosen by Jesus after a night of prayer (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12-16</a>). He witnessed every miracle and heard every teaching, yet his heart remained divided.<p>&#8226; John notes his hidden corruption: &#8220;he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Jesus had spoken openly: &#8220;Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-70.htm">John 6:70</a>). Judas proves that proximity to truth does not guarantee submission to it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>one of the Twelve</b><p>&#8226; Mark stresses the tragedy: the betrayer is not an outsider but a member of the inner circle (<a href="/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; This fulfills David&#8217;s lament centuries earlier: &#8220;Even my close friend in whom I trusted&#8230; has lifted up his heel against me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>; cf. <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a> reminds us that Scripture had foretold Judas&#8217;s role, yet he acted with real responsibility. Divine sovereignty and human accountability run side by side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went to the chief priests</b><p>&#8226; Judas initiates the contact. The religious leaders had already decided to kill Jesus (<a href="/john/11-57.htm">John 11:57</a>), but they lacked a convenient, discreet means. Judas supplies it.<p>&#8226; Luke adds spiritual insight: &#8220;Satan entered Judas&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-4</a>). The devil uses willing vessels; Judas&#8217;s greed opens the door.<p>&#8226; The chief priests represent the highest religious authority. Their partnership with Judas exposes the emptiness of religious ritual divorced from genuine faith (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to betray Jesus to them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Betray&#8221; means to hand over deliberately. Jesus had predicted it repeatedly: &#8220;The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-31.htm">Mark 9:31</a>; 10:33; 14:18).<p>&#8226; The act was premeditated and financially motivated: <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a> records Judas asking, &#8220;What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?&#8221; and receiving thirty pieces of silver&#8212;echoing <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet even this darkest deed serves God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).

The betrayal follows immediately after the anointing by Mary. We may suppose that the other disciples who had murmured on account of this waste of the ointment, were brought to their senses by our Lord's rebuke, and felt its force. But with Judas the case was very different. The rebuke, which had a salutary effect on them, only served to harden him. He had lost one opportunity of gain; he would seek another. In his cupidity and wickedness he resolves to betray his Master, and sell him to the Jews. So while the chief priests were plotting how they might destroy him, they found an apt and unexpected instrument for their purpose in one of his own disciples. Judas came to them, and the vile and hateful bargain was concluded. It marks the tremendous iniquity of the transaction that it was "one of the twelve" who betrayed him - not one of the seventy, but one of those who were in the closest intimacy and nearness to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Judas</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#959;&#973;&#948;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Ioudas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2455.htm">Strong's 2455: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Judas, the name of ten Israelites; also of the posterity of one of them and its region.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Iscariot,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#8060;&#952;</span> <span class="translit">(Iskari&#333;th)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2469.htm">Strong's 2469: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iscariot, surname of Judas.
