The Pharisees were influential in the synagogues and held significant sway over Jewish religious life. Their concern with purity laws made them wary of associating with those deemed unclean or sinful. Jesus eating with "these people" refers to tax collectors and sinners, who were marginalized and considered impure by the religious elite. This act of eating together symbolized acceptance and fellowship, challenging the social and religious norms of the time.<p><b>they asked His disciples</b><br>The Pharisees directed their question to Jesus' disciples rather than Jesus Himself, possibly to sow doubt or confusion among them. This indirect approach reflects a common tactic used by religious leaders to undermine authority without direct confrontation. The disciples, still learning about Jesus' mission, might have been unsure how to respond, highlighting the tension between Jesus' radical inclusivity and the established religious order.<p><b>&#8220;Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?&#8221;</b><br>Tax collectors were despised in Jewish society for collaborating with the Roman occupiers and often engaging in corrupt practices. Sinners referred to those who did not adhere to the Pharisaic interpretation of the Law, including those with questionable professions or lifestyles. By eating with them, Jesus demonstrated His mission to seek and save the lost, as seen in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>. This act foreshadows the inclusivity of the Gospel, breaking down barriers between Jew and Gentile, righteous and sinner, as emphasized in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>. Jesus' actions fulfilled prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of bringing good news to the poor and freedom to captives, illustrating His role as the Messiah who reaches out to all, regardless of social or religious status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

The words "publicans and sinners" are thus inverted in their order in the two clauses, as though they were convertible terms. Of course, the scribes and Pharisees had not sat down at this feast, but some of them had probably found their way into the chamber in which the feast was going on, where they would comment freely upon what they saw, and condemn our Lord's conduct as inconsistent with his character. It is as though they said, "By this conduct he transgresses the Law of God and the traditions of the elders.
