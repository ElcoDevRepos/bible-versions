This reflects their ambition and perhaps a misunderstanding of the nature of Jesus' mission. Their response is reminiscent of Peter's bold declarations of loyalty, highlighting a common theme of overconfidence among the disciples. This moment underscores the human tendency to underestimate the cost of discipleship and the depth of commitment required to follow Christ.<p><b>&#8220;You will drink the cup that I drink,&#8221; Jesus said,</b><br>The "cup" is a metaphor for suffering and divine wrath, often used in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jesus refers to His impending suffering and crucifixion. By stating that James and John will also drink this cup, Jesus prophesies their future trials and martyrdom. James would later be martyred by Herod Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), and John would face persecution and exile. This phrase emphasizes the cost of following Jesus and the shared destiny of suffering for His sake.<p><b>&#8220;and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo.&#8221;</b><br>The term "baptism" here symbolizes being overwhelmed by suffering, akin to being submerged in water. Jesus speaks of His impending death and the overwhelming nature of His sacrifice. This baptism is not one of water but of suffering and death, aligning with the imagery of baptism as a form of identification with Christ's death and resurrection (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). The disciples' future experiences would mirror this, as they would face persecution and trials for their faith. This phrase highlights the theme of identification with Christ in His sufferings, a key aspect of Christian discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to the request of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, regarding positions of honor in His kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/james_and_john.htm">James and John</a></b><br>The sons of Zebedee, also known as the "Sons of Thunder," who are seeking positions of prominence in Jesus' kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup_and_baptism.htm">The Cup and Baptism</a></b><br>Metaphors used by Jesus to describe the suffering and trials He will endure, which James and John will also experience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The broader group of Jesus' followers who are present and later react to the request of James and John.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus is heading, and where His ultimate suffering, death, and resurrection will occur.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">Understanding the Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus involves sharing in His sufferings.

Their later lives prove the reliability of His word and illustrate the call to every disciple: embrace the Savior, endure the cost, and anticipate the glory that follows faithful suffering with Him (<a href="/1_peter/5-10.htm">1 Peter 5:10</a>; <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">And with the baptism.</span>--Here, as before, the clause is omitted in the best MSS. of St. Matthew, and is therefore, strictly speaking, peculiar to St. Mark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - James and John seem to have understood the meaning of the cup; and perhaps also of the baptism. They both of them drank the cup, though in different ways. St. James, preaching Christ more boldly and fervently, became an early martyr, having been slain by the sword of Herod (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>). St. John also drank of this cup, and was baptized with this baptism, when, if we may trust the authority of Tertullian ('De Praescript.' c. 36.). He he was cast by order of Domitian into a caldron of boiling oil, before the Porta Latina at Rome, although the oil had no power to hurt him. Another legend states that he drank a cup of poison, and took no harm. On this account he is frequently represented with a cup in his hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/10-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;We can,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#965;&#957;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#952;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Dynametha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1410.htm">Strong's 1410: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I am powerful, have (the) power, (b) I am able, I can.
