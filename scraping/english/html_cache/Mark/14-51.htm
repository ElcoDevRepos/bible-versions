The identity of this young man is not specified, leading to various interpretations. Some scholars suggest he could be Mark himself, the author of the Gospel, providing a personal eyewitness account. The mention of a "young man" may symbolize the vulnerability and fear experienced by Jesus' followers during His arrest. This moment occurs in the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of significant emotional and spiritual turmoil, as Jesus is betrayed and arrested.<p><b>was wearing a linen cloth around his body</b><br>The linen cloth indicates a garment typically worn by the wealthy or those of higher social status, suggesting that this young man might have been from a well-to-do family. Linen was also used for burial shrouds, which could symbolically foreshadow Jesus' impending death and burial. The use of linen in this context highlights the urgency and unexpectedness of the situation, as the young man may have hastily followed Jesus without proper attire.<p><b>They caught hold of him</b><br>This phrase describes the attempt to seize the young man, reflecting the chaos and fear surrounding Jesus' arrest. The act of catching hold of him signifies the broader rejection and abandonment Jesus faced from His followers. This moment parallels the disciples' earlier desertion, emphasizing the fulfillment of Jesus' prediction that His followers would scatter. The young man's escape, which follows in the next verse, underscores the theme of human frailty and the fulfillment of prophecy regarding the Messiah's suffering and isolation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_man.htm">Young Man</a></b><br>An unnamed young man who was following Jesus during His arrest.

It had clearly made a deep impression on the minds of some of the disciples (probably enough, on that of Peter), from whom, directly or indirectly, the report came. Who it was that appeared in this strange fashion we are left to conjecture. Some have supposed that it was St. Mark himself, but for this there is obviously no ground but the fact that this Evangelist alone records it. A careful examination of the facts suggests another conclusion as probable. (1) The man was "young," and the self-same term is applied to the ruler who had great possessions (<a href="/matthew/19-20.htm" title="The young man said to him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?">Matthew 19:20</a>). (2) He had apparently been sleeping, or, it may be, watching, not far from Gethsemane, with the linen sheet wrapped round him, and had been roused by the approach of the officers and the crowd. This suggests one who lived somewhere on the Mount of Olives, and so far points to Lazarus or Simon of Bethany, as the only two conspicuous disciples in that neighbourhood. (3) He was one who so loved our Lord that he went on following Him when all the disciples forsook Him and fled, and this also was what might be expected from Lazarus. On the supposition suggested in (1), he was now obeying almost literally the command, "Take up thy cross, and follow Me." (See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/19-16.htm" title="And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?">Matthew 19:16-22</a>.) (4) He was one whom the officers (the words "the young men" are omitted in the better MSS.) were eager to seize, when they allowed all the disciples to go their way, and this agrees with the command which had been given by the priests, that they should take and kill Lazarus also (<a href="/john/12-10.htm" title="But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;">John 12:10</a>). (5) As the "linen sheet" or <span class= "ital">sindon</span> (see Note on <a href="/matthew/27-59.htm" title="And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,">Matthew 27:59</a>) was especially used for the burial of the dead, it is conceivable, on this supposition, that what had been the winding-sheet of the dead Lazarus had been kept and used by him in memory of his resurrection. (6) On the hypothesis thus suggested, the suppression of the name stands on the same footing as that of the name of the sister of Lazarus, who poured the precious ointment on our Lord's head at Bethany (<a href="/matthew/26-7.htm" title="There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.">Matthew 26:7</a>, <a href="/mark/14-3.htm" title="And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she broke the box, and poured it on his head.">Mark 14:3</a>), whom the Evangelists must have known, but whom they mention simply as a "woman." Their lips were sealed as to the family of Bethany until the circumstances, whatever they may have been, that called for silence had passed away. It is obvious that so far as this identity is established it suggests many thoughts of profound interest. What had seemed impossible to men had proved possible with God. He who had gone away sorrowful because he had great possessions, had given freely to the poor (see Notes on <a href="/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-9.htm" title="For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.">Matthew 26:9</a>), and had proved more faithful than the Twelve, and so the last had become the first. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a certain young</span> <span class="cmt_word">man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him</span>. St. Mark is the only evangelist who mentions this incident; and there seems good reason for supposing that he here describes what happened to himself. Such is the mode in which St. John refers to himself in his Gospel, and where there can be no doubt that he is speaking of himself. If the conclusion in an earlier part of this commentary be correct, that it was at the house to which John Mark belonged that our Lord celebrated the Passover, and from whence he went out to the Mount of Olives; what more probable than that Mark had been with him on that occasion, and had perhaps a presentiment that something was about to happen to him? What more likely than that the crowd who took Jesus may have passed by this house, and that Mark may have been roused from his bed (it was now a late hour) by the tumult. Having a linen cloth (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) cast about his naked body. The <span class="accented">sindon</span> was a fine linen cloth, indicating that he belonged to a family in good circumstances. It is an unusual word. In every other place of the New Testament where it is used it refers to the garment or shroud used to cover the bodies of the dead. The <span class="accented">sindon</span> is supposed to take its name from Sidon, where the particular kind of linen was manufactured of which the garment was made. It was a kind of light cloak frequently worn in hot weather. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/14-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">One</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5100.htm">Strong's 5100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Any one, some one, a certain one or thing.
