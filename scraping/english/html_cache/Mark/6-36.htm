This moment occurs after a long day of teaching and healing by Jesus, highlighting the physical and spiritual demands of His ministry. The disciples' approach is pragmatic, yet it contrasts with Jesus' later miraculous provision, emphasizing His divine ability to meet needs beyond human limitations. This phrase also underscores the disciples' growing role in Jesus' ministry, as they begin to take initiative in addressing the needs of the people.<p><b>so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages</b><br>The mention of the "surrounding countryside and villages" provides a geographical context, indicating that the event took place in a relatively remote area. This setting is significant because it underscores the logistical challenge of feeding such a large crowd. The region around the Sea of Galilee, where this event likely occurred, was dotted with small villages and agricultural land, which would have been the nearest sources of food. This detail highlights the disciples' reliance on conventional means to solve the problem, contrasting with the miraculous solution Jesus provides.<p><b>and buy themselves something to eat.&#8221;</b><br>The suggestion for the crowd to "buy themselves something to eat" reflects the disciples' understanding of personal responsibility and self-sufficiency. In the cultural context of first-century Judea, buying food would have been a common practice, yet it also implies that the crowd had the means to purchase food, which may not have been the case for all. This phrase sets the stage for Jesus' miraculous feeding of the five thousand, which not only meets the immediate physical needs of the people but also serves as a sign of His messianic identity. The provision of food in the wilderness echoes the Old Testament account of manna provided to the Israelites, drawing a parallel between Jesus and Moses, and pointing to Jesus as the true Bread of Life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching the crowds.

The crowd interrupted that retreat, so the disciples now think, &#8220;Let&#8217;s wrap this up.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Parallel accounts show the same concern: &#8220;This is a desolate place&#8230; send the crowds away&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15</a>; <a href="/luke/9-12.htm">Luke 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Jesus is &#8220;moved with compassion&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-34.htm">Mark 6:34</a>) and chooses to stay engaged.

Their wallets can&#8217;t carry the weight.<p>&#8226; The scene sets up a living illustration of <a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>: &#8220;Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In John&#8217;s parallel, Jesus later tells the crowd, &#8220;Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>). Physical bread will point to the Bread of Life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/6-36.htm">Mark 6:36</a> captures the disciples&#8217; instinct to manage the situation naturally&#8212;dismiss, disperse, delegate. Jesus will soon reveal a heavenly alternative: keep the crowd close and supply their need supernaturally. The verse reminds us that our first, most logical proposal is not always God&#8217;s final answer. Rather than sending people away, He often invites us to become channels of His compassionate provision, proving again that nothing is too hard for the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Into the country.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the farms</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the enclosed, cultivated land, and what belonged to it.<p><span class= "bld">And buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.</span>--The better MSS. give simply, "buy themselves what they may eat."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/6-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Dismiss</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#955;&#965;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apolyson)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_630.htm">Strong's 630: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and luo; to free fully, i.e. relieve, release, dismiss, or let die, pardon or divorce.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the crowd]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
