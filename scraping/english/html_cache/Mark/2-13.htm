The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Gennesaret, was a central location in Jesus' ministry, providing a backdrop for many of His teachings and miracles. This setting allowed for large gatherings, as the natural amphitheater effect of the shoreline enabled His voice to carry to the crowds. The sea also symbolizes the boundary between the known and the unknown, reflecting Jesus' mission to reach beyond traditional boundaries.<p><b>All the people came to Him,</b><br>This phrase highlights the widespread appeal and magnetic draw of Jesus' ministry. People from various backgrounds and social standings were drawn to Him, indicating His universal message and the hope He offered. This gathering of people fulfills the prophetic vision of the Messiah drawing all nations to Himself, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where all nations stream to the mountain of the Lord. It also reflects the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and He taught them there.</b><br>Teaching was a central aspect of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing His role as a rabbi and a prophet. His teachings often included parables, which were simple stories with profound spiritual truths, making His message accessible to all. This phrase underscores the importance of Jesus' teachings in revealing the nature of God's kingdom and His expectations for His followers. The act of teaching by the sea also connects to the imagery of the sea as a place of revelation and transformation, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Moses parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and Jonah's encounter with the great fish (Jonah 1-2).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, the Son of God, who is teaching by the sea.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Likely the Sea of Galilee, a significant location in Jesus' ministry where He often taught and performed miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The crowd that followed Jesus, eager to hear His teachings and witness His works.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/teaching.htm">Teaching</a></b><br>The act of Jesus imparting wisdom and truth to the people, a central aspect of His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_place_in_ministry.htm">The Importance of Place in Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus often chose significant locations for His teachings, such as the Sea of Galilee.

The word "again" refers to his former going forth (see <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). When he went forth on this occasion he appears to have traveled southwards along the sea-shore. There, not far from Capernaum<span class="cmt_word">, he saw Levi, the son of Alphseus, sitting at the receipt of custom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); more literally, <span class="accented">at the place of toll.</span> This place would be in the direct line for traders from Damascus to Accho, and a convenient spot for the receipt of the duties on the shipping. It is observable that in St. Matthew's own Gospel (<a href="/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9</a>) he describes himself as "a man named Matthew." St. Luke, like St. Mark, calls him Levi. The same person is no doubt meant. It is most likely that his original name was Levi, and that upon his call to be an apostle he received a new name, that of Matthew, or Mattathias, which, according to Gesenius, means "the gift of Jehovah." In his own Gospel he names himself Matthew, that he might proclaim the kindness and love of Christ towards him, in the spirit of St. Paul, where he says, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief" (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). Follow me; me, that is, whom you have already heard preaching the gospel of the kingdom in Capernaum, and confirming it by many miracles, and especially by that conspicuous miracle spoken of by all, the healing of the paralytic. St. Chrysostom says that "our Lord called Matthew, who was already constrained by the report of his miracles." The condescension of Christ is shown in this, that he called Matthew the "publican," who on that account was odious to the Jews, not only to be a partaker of his grace, but to be one of his chosen followers, a friend, an apostle, and an evangelist. It has been urged against the truth of Christianity, by Porphyry and others, that the first disciples followed Christ blindly, as though they would have followed without reason any one who called them. But they were not men who acted upon mere impulse and without reason. The miracles, no doubt, produced an impression upon them. And then we may reasonably suppose that their moral faculties perceived the majesty of Deity shining through the countenance of the Son of God. As the magnet attracts the iron, so Christ drew Matthew and others to himself; and by this attractive power he communicated his graces and virtues to them, such as an ardent love of God, contempt of the world, and burning zeal for the salvation of souls. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Once]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] went out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
