They were known for their strict adherence to the Law of Moses and the oral traditions. Their approach often put them at odds with Jesus, who emphasized the spirit rather than the letter of the law. The Pharisees' presence here indicates their ongoing scrutiny and opposition to Jesus' ministry.<p><b>and began to argue with Jesus</b><br>This phrase highlights the confrontational nature of the Pharisees' interaction with Jesus. Their arguments were not genuine inquiries but rather attempts to challenge His authority and teachings. This reflects a broader pattern in the Gospels where religious leaders frequently question Jesus to undermine His influence among the people.<p><b>testing Him</b><br>The Pharisees' intention was to test Jesus, similar to the way Satan tested Him in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). This testing was not for the purpose of learning but to trap Jesus into saying or doing something that could be used against Him. It reflects their skepticism and unwillingness to accept His identity as the Messiah.<p><b>by demanding from Him a sign from heaven</b><br>A "sign from heaven" refers to a miraculous event that would serve as divine confirmation of Jesus' authority. In Jewish tradition, signs from heaven were seen as direct interventions from God, such as the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The demand for a sign indicates the Pharisees' disbelief and their desire for undeniable proof of Jesus' claims, despite the many miracles He had already performed. This request echoes the Israelites' demand for signs during their exodus journey, highlighting a recurring theme of unbelief and testing God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pharisees.htm">The Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

They had already asked for a sign from heaven (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>); but now this miracle gives them occasion to ask again. For when they saw how greatly it was extolled by the multitudes who had benefited by it, it was easy for them to urge that it was an earthly sign, and might have been wrought by him who is called "the God of this world;" and so they insinuated that he had wrought this miracle as well as his other miracles by the power of Satan. Therefore they seek a sign from heaven, that he who dwells in heaven might thus bear witness that he came from God, and that his doctrine was Divine; the Pharisees probably meant that if he did this they would believe in him as the Messiah, and lead the people to the same faith. The Sadducees, who were practically atheists, thought that no sign could be given from heaven by God, seeing that in their opinion it was doubtful whether there was any God to give it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
