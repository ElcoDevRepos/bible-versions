The setting is likely in Galilee, a region where Jesus spent much of His ministry. The act of calling the crowd suggests His authority and the importance of His message. It reflects the pattern seen throughout the Gospels where Jesus engages with the masses, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. This gathering of the crowd can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic role of the Messiah, who would draw people to Himself (<a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>).<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking here is significant, as it underscores the oral tradition of teaching in Jewish culture. Jesus' words are central to His ministry, and His teachings often challenge existing religious norms. This moment is a continuation of His mission to reveal deeper spiritual truths to the people, contrasting with the Pharisees' focus on external rituals.<p><b>&#8220;All of you,</b><br>This inclusive address highlights the universal nature of Jesus' message. It is not limited to a select group but is intended for everyone present. This inclusivity is a hallmark of Jesus' ministry, breaking down social and religious barriers. It echoes the call to all nations seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>listen to Me</b><br>The command to listen emphasizes the importance of Jesus' words. In Jewish tradition, listening is closely linked to obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). Jesus is positioning Himself as the ultimate authority, whose teachings require attention and response. This call to listen is reminiscent of the Shema, a central declaration of faith in Judaism, underscoring the significance of His message.<p><b>and understand:</b><br>Understanding goes beyond mere hearing; it involves comprehending and internalizing the message. Jesus often spoke in parables, requiring His audience to seek deeper meaning. This call to understand is an invitation to discern spiritual truths, contrasting with the Pharisees' focus on external observance. It aligns with the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, where understanding is prized (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowd, emphasizing the importance of understanding His message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A group of people gathered around Jesus, representing a diverse audience eager to hear His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_scribes.htm">Pharisees and Scribes</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they are part of the broader context of <a href="/bsb/mark/7.htm">Mark 7</a>, where Jesus addresses their legalistic traditions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Jesus' followers who are present and learning from His teachings, often needing further explanation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>The region where Jesus is teaching, a significant area for His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening.htm">The Importance of Listening</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need for attentive listening, which is crucial for understanding spiritual truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_over_rituals.htm">Understanding Over Rituals</a></b><br>The focus is on internal transformation rather than external compliance with traditions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_condition.htm">Heart Condition</a></b><br>True defilement comes from within, highlighting the need for a pure heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_engagement.htm">Active Engagement</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively engage with Jesus' teachings, seeking deeper understanding and application.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_faith.htm">Discernment in Faith</a></b><br>Developing discernment is essential for distinguishing between human traditions and God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Mark_7_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Mark 7:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_14_Rethink_purity_defilement.htm">How does Mark 7:14 challenge our understanding of purity and defilement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jesus_command_imply.htm">What does "Listen to Me, all of you, and understand" imply about Jesus' authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_14_Spiritual_vs_Physical_guidance.htm">How can Mark 7:14 guide our discernment of spiritual versus physical concerns?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_7_14_link_to_OT_purity.htm">In what ways does Mark 7:14 connect to Old Testament teachings on purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_internal_purity_daily.htm">How can we apply the principle of internal purity in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_14_Spiritual_vs_physical_purity.htm">What does Mark 7:14 reveal about the nature of spiritual purity versus physical actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Mark_7_14_s_impact_on_dietary_laws.htm">How does Mark 7:14 challenge traditional views on dietary laws?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Mark_7_14_redefine_defilement.htm">In what way does Mark 7:14 redefine the concept of defilement?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_mark_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Mark 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_mark_7_14-15_align_with_ot_laws.htm">How can Jesus&#8217; claim that all foods are clean (Mark 7:14&#8211;15) be reconciled with strict dietary laws in the Old Testament?

By commanding, &#8220;Listen to Me and understand,&#8221; He underscores that genuine purity begins with a receptive heart that believes and obeys His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - In the Authorized Version the beginning of this verse runs thus: "And when he had called all the people unto him, he said." But according to the best authorities, the adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> should be inserted, and the words will run as follows: <span class="cmt_word">- And he called to him the multitude again</span>. It is probable that he had waved them from him while he held this discourse with the scribes from Jerusalem. But now he calls the people near to him again, that all might hear that which concerned all alike. It is probable, indeed, that this discussion with the scribes may have taken place in the house, into which he again returned after having made this authoritative declaration to the multitude. The words are given with more emphasis here than as recorded by St. Matthew. Every one was solemnly invited to hearken and understand, while he announced a principle of the highest importance. Our Lord did not intend to disparage the difference between clean and unclean meats as it had been laid down in the Levitical Law. His object rather was to clear that teaching from the obscurities in which it had been involved by the scribes and Pharisees, who laid stress only on external acts. His object was to show that all impurity springs from the heart; and that, unless the heart is cleansed, all external washings are in vain. It is as though he said, "The scribes teach you that it is not lawful to eat with unwashen hands because unwashen hands make the food clean, and unclean food defiles the soul. But in this they err; because not that which enters from without into the mouth, but that which proceeds from within through the mouth, and so from the heart, if it be impure, - this defiles the man;" as he more fully explains at ver. 21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Once again</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
