Its preservative qualities made it essential for maintaining the freshness of food in a time without refrigeration. In the Old Testament, salt was also used in covenant-making (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), symbolizing the enduring nature of agreements. Jesus' reference to salt here underscores its importance and value, drawing a parallel to the role of believers in the world as preservers of truth and righteousness.<p><b>but if the salt loses its saltiness,</b><br>Salt losing its saltiness is a metaphor for believers losing their distinctiveness or effectiveness. In the ancient world, salt could become contaminated with impurities, rendering it useless. This serves as a warning to maintain spiritual integrity and influence. The idea is echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>, where Jesus warns that salt that loses its flavor is no longer good for anything. This phrase challenges believers to remain pure and impactful in their faith and witness.<p><b>with what will you season it?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the irreplaceability of salt's function. Once salt loses its essential qualities, it cannot be restored. Similarly, if believers lose their spiritual fervor or moral distinctiveness, they become ineffective in their mission. This calls for self-examination and vigilance in maintaining one's faith and witness, as there is no substitute for the unique role believers play in the world.<p><b>Have salt among yourselves,</b><br>This phrase encourages believers to embody the qualities of salt&#8212;purity, preservation, and flavor&#8212;in their interactions with one another. It suggests fostering a community characterized by integrity, wisdom, and grace. The call to "have salt" implies maintaining a distinct Christian character that influences and enriches the community, much like salt enhances the flavor of food.<p><b>and be at peace with one another.&#8221;</b><br>Peace is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus, who is referred to as the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). This command to be at peace with one another highlights the importance of unity and harmony within the Christian community. It reflects the broader biblical mandate to live peaceably with all (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>) and echoes Jesus' teachings on reconciliation and forgiveness (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>).

There, however, the primary reference of the words is to the visible community of believers, the Church of Christ, as preserving the world from corruption. Here the words speak primarily of the inward grace, of which the salt is the symbol, and which alone makes the Church what it ought to be, as "the salt of the earth."<p><span class= "bld">Have salt in yourselves.</span>--The words that follow, "have peace in yourselves," seem to refer to the contention in <a href="/mark/9-33.htm" title="And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?">Mark 9:33</a>, with which this portion of our Lord's teaching had begun. The purity from selfish aims, which was symbolised by the "salt," was the chief or only preservative of peace.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Salt is good</span>; that is, it is useful and beneficial. This is true of the literal salt. Its wholesome antiseptic properties are universally recognized. But our Lord has before his mind in this whole passage the spiritual meaning. He is thinking of the salt of Divine grace, of the salt of a spirit informed and influenced by the Holy Spirit. He had already told his disciples that they were "the salt of the earth." Not, indeed, that they could deliver the earth from corruption - that was beyond their power. But when Christ had delivered it by his mighty sacrifice and the gift of his Spirit, it was their business, as it is the duty of all Christians, to keep it in a healthy state; so that by their wisdom and purity, their holy lives and holy teaching, they might season the whole world. <span class="cmt_word">But if the salt have lost its saltness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">wherewith will ye season it?</span> This insipid, tasteless condition of salt is familiar to travelers in the East Examples are to be found of largo masses of salt which "has lost its savor." Our Lord here applies this in a spiritual sense to his disciples. "If ye, my disciples, who are the salt of the earth, - if ye lose the true properties of salt; if your Christianity loses its heart, its quickening, stimulating influence; so that on account of the love of the world, or the fear of man, or through lust or ambition, you fall away from the heavenly doctrine and life; - who shall restore you to your former spiritual health and vigor? With what can salt itself be seasoned when its own chemical energies are lost?" Our Lord plays upon this figure of salt, and cautions his disciples, lest by any means they should lose the qualities of this mystic salt. <span class="cmt_word">Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another</span>. This sentence fitly winds up the whole. Have the salt of wisdom and purity, and of a Christian life, namely, humility, charity, contempt of the world, and especially peace. Do not be idly contending about place or position, as not long ago you were disputing (ver. 33). Our Lord foresaw that this kind of contention, these rivalries, and these ambitious aims, would prove a great scandal and a great hindranee to the progress of his Church in the future ages of the world. But he also knew that if his disciples in every ago would endeavor to "keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," their influence would be irresistible, and they would draw all men to them and to himself, the great Centre of attraction, and "the confidence of all the ends of the earth" (<a href="/psalms/65-5.htm">Psalm 65:5</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/9-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Salt [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7941;&#955;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(halas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_217.htm">Strong's 217: </a> </span><span class="str2">Salt.
