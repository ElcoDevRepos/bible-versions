In the context of <a href="/mark/5.htm">Mark 5</a>, Jesus encounters a man possessed by a legion of demons. The demons recognize Jesus' power and authority, requesting permission to enter the pigs. This demonstrates Jesus' sovereignty, as even the forces of darkness must submit to His will. This authority is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>) and His command over nature (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p><b>and the unclean spirits came out</b><br>The term "unclean spirits" refers to demonic entities, emphasizing their impurity and opposition to God's holiness. The expulsion of these spirits signifies Jesus' power to cleanse and restore individuals from spiritual bondage. This act is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, which speaks of liberation for the captives. It also prefigures the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's death and resurrection.<p><b>and went into the pigs</b><br>Pigs were considered unclean animals according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>). The demons' entry into the pigs underscores the theme of uncleanness and the separation between the holy and the profane. This event also serves as a visual representation of the destructive nature of evil, as the pigs' fate mirrors the spiritual destruction the demons intended for the possessed man.<p><b>and the herd of about two thousand</b><br>The large number of pigs indicates the magnitude of the demonic presence within the man, as the term "legion" suggests a multitude. This detail emphasizes the severity of the man's condition and the comprehensive nature of Jesus' deliverance. The number also highlights the economic impact on the local community, which may have contributed to their fear and request for Jesus to leave (<a href="/mark/5-17.htm">Mark 5:17</a>).<p><b>rushed down the steep bank into the sea</b><br>The geographical setting near the Sea of Galilee provides a vivid backdrop for this dramatic event. The steep bank suggests a sudden and uncontrollable descent, symbolizing the inevitable downfall of evil when confronted by divine authority. This imagery parallels other biblical instances where water signifies judgment and chaos, such as the Flood (Genesis 7) and the Red Sea crossing (Exodus 14).<p><b>and drowned in the water</b><br>The drowning of the pigs serves as a powerful symbol of the ultimate fate of evil. Water, often associated with chaos and destruction, becomes the means by which the unclean spirits meet their end. This act foreshadows the final judgment and eradication of evil, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>. It also reinforces the theme of Jesus as the deliverer who brings order and peace to a world marred by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus demonstrates His authority over the spiritual realm by permitting the unclean spirits to enter the pigs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/unclean_spirits.htm">Unclean Spirits</a></b><br>These are demonic entities that possessed a man and, upon Jesus' command, entered a herd of pigs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pigs.htm">The Pigs</a></b><br>A herd of about two thousand pigs that became the vessels for the unclean spirits and subsequently rushed into the sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>The body of water into which the pigs rushed and drowned, symbolizing the destructive nature of the demonic forces.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gerasenes.htm">The Gerasenes</a></b><br>The region where this event took place, highlighting the Gentile setting and the broader reach of Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_christ.htm">Authority of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' command over the unclean spirits demonstrates His supreme authority over all creation, including the spiritual realm.
