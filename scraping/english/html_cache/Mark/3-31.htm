The mention of His brothers suggests that Mary had other children after Jesus, which aligns with references in <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55-56</a>. The presence of His family indicates their concern for Him, possibly due to the growing tension and opposition Jesus faced from religious leaders. This familial visit underscores the humanity of Jesus, who, despite His divine mission, was part of a human family.<p><b>and stood outside.</b><br>The fact that they stood outside suggests a physical separation from Jesus, who was inside teaching. This separation can symbolize a spiritual or mission-oriented distance, as Jesus was increasingly focused on His divine mission, which sometimes conflicted with familial expectations. The setting also reflects the crowded nature of Jesus' gatherings, where His teachings drew large crowds, making it difficult for His family to reach Him directly.<p><b>They sent someone in to summon Him,</b><br>This action indicates the family's desire to speak with Jesus, possibly out of concern for His well-being or to persuade Him to take a different approach to His ministry. The act of sending someone in reflects the cultural norms of the time, where direct access to a teacher or rabbi might be mediated by a messenger. This moment sets the stage for Jesus to redefine familial relationships in the context of His spiritual mission, as He later emphasizes the primacy of spiritual kinship over biological ties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching with authority.

Scripture plainly calls them His brothers, showing that after Jesus&#8217; virgin birth, Joseph and Mary had other children (<a href="/matthew/1-24.htm">Matthew 1:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse follows a scene in which crowds pressed around Jesus (<a href="/mark/3-20.htm">Mark 3:20-21</a>). His family had earlier tried to restrain Him, thinking He was &#8220;out of His mind.&#8221; Now they come in person.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a> parallels Mark and adds that they were &#8220;standing outside, seeking to speak with Him.&#8221; <a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a> notes that &#8220;not even His brothers believed in Him&#8221; at this stage, underscoring their spiritual distance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stood outside</b><p>&#8226; Physical detail: they are outside the house where Jesus is teaching (<a href="/mark/3-32.htm">Mark 3:32</a>). This highlights both the packed crowd and the symbolic distance between flesh-and-blood relatives and those sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet.<p>&#8226; Being outside contrasts with those &#8220;sitting around Him&#8221; inside (<a href="/mark/3-34.htm">Mark 3:34</a>). The narrative sets up a lesson about true kinship defined by obedience to God.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/luke/8-19.htm">Luke 8:19</a> stresses they &#8220;could not reach Him because of the crowd,&#8221; amplifying the separation theme. <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a> pictures Jesus standing outside and knocking&#8212;roles reversed, yet the idea of relational nearness vs. distance is similar.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They sent someone in</b><p>&#8226; Instead of pushing through themselves, they relay a message.

The text invites us to compare natural claims on Jesus with spiritual priorities.<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/1_samuel/3-5.htm">1 Samuel 3:5-8</a> shows young Samuel repeatedly responding to a call; contrast Jesus, who waits and redefines the call rather than immediately responding to family summons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to summon Him</b><p>&#8226; The Greek idea is &#8220;to call&#8221; or &#8220;summon.&#8221; They are effectively asking Jesus to stop teaching and come out.<p>&#8226; Jesus does not comply; instead, He uses the occasion to teach that whoever does God&#8217;s will is His true family (<a href="/mark/3-33.htm">Mark 3:33-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references: <a href="/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a> records twelve-year-old Jesus telling Mary, &#8220;Did you not know that I must be about My Father&#8217;s business?&#8221;&#8212;a lifelong priority that still governs Him here. <a href="/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a> echoes this focus: &#8220;My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/mark/3-31.htm">Mark 3:31</a> presents a real historical moment: Jesus&#8217; mother and brothers arrive, remain outside, and try to summon Him. Their physical presence and request set the stage for Jesus to redefine family around obedience to God. The verse thus contrasts natural relationships with the spiritual bond formed by doing the Father&#8217;s will, preparing us for His declaration that true kinship is rooted in discipleship, not merely in blood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/mark/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31-35) <span class= "bld">There came then his brethren and his mother.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/context/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46-50</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/mark/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-33.</span> - Our Lord's brethren and his mother had now arrived (see ver. 21) to look after him. He was in the house teaching; but the crowd was so great that they could not approach him. The multitude filled not only the room, but the courtyard and all the approaches. St. Luke (Lujke 8:19) says," they could not come at him for the crowd." <span class="cmt_word">His brethren</span> here spoken of were in all probability his cousins, the sons of Mary, the wife of Alphaeus or Clopas. But two of these, already chosen to be apostles, were most likely with him in the room, and of the number of those towards whom he stretched out his hand and said, "Behold, my mother and my brethren!" whilst Mary and the others had come (Mary, perhaps, induced by the others in the hope that the sight of his mother might the more move him) for the purpose of bringing him back to the quiet of Nazareth. We cannot suppose that the Virgin Mary came with any other feeling than that of a mother's anxiety in behalf of her Son. She may have thought that he was in danger, exposed to the fickle temper of a large multitude, who might at any moment have their passions stirred against him by his enemies, the scribes and Pharisees; and so she was willingly persuaded to come and use her influence with him to induce him to escape from what appeared evidently to be a position of some danger. If so, this explains our Lord's behavior on this occasion. The multitude was sitting about him, and he was teaching them; and then a message was brought to him from his mother and his brethren who were without, perhaps in the courtyard, perhaps beyond in the open street, calling for him. The interruption was untimely, not to say unseemly. And so he says, not without a little tone of severity in his words, <span class="cmt_word">Who is my mother and my brethren?</span> Our Lord did not speak thus as denying his human relationship; as though he was not "very man," but a mere "phantom," as some early heretics taught; and still less as though he was ashamed of his earthly lationships; but partly perhaps because the messengers too boldly and inconsiderately interrupted him while he was teaching; and chiefly that he might show that his heavenly Father's business was more to him than the affection of his earthly mother, greatly as he valued it; and thus he preferred the spiritual relationship, in which there is neither male nor female, bond nor free, but all stand alike to Christ in the relationship of brother, sister, and mother. It is remarkable, and yet the reason for the omission is obvious, that our Lord does not mention" father" in this spiritual category. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/mark/3-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus&#8217;]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
