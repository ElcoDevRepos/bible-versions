The term "disciples" refers to those who are learners or students of Jesus, highlighting the teacher-student relationship. This interaction underscores the importance of discipleship in Jesus' ministry, where He prepares them for future leadership roles. The disciples' presence also emphasizes the communal aspect of Jesus' ministry, as He often worked within a group setting.<p><b>to have a boat ready for Him</b><br>The request for a boat suggests a strategic move by Jesus to manage the large crowds. The Sea of Galilee, where much of Jesus' ministry took place, provided a natural setting for such a request. Boats were common in this region, used for fishing and transportation. This action demonstrates Jesus' awareness of His surroundings and His ability to use available resources to continue His teaching. It also foreshadows other instances where Jesus uses a boat, such as when He calms the storm (<a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>).<p><b>so that the crowd would not crush Him</b><br>The mention of the crowd highlights the immense popularity and demand for Jesus' presence and teachings. People were drawn to Him for healing and spiritual guidance, often resulting in large gatherings. The concern about being crushed indicates the fervor and desperation of the people seeking Jesus, as well as the potential danger of such large crowds. This scenario reflects the growing tension between Jesus' mission and the practical challenges of His ministry. It also illustrates the human side of Jesus, who, despite His divine nature, took precautions for His safety and well-being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel of Mark, performing miracles and teaching with authority.

Word of His healings had spread (<a href="/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>), so people were flocking from every direction.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear in <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a> and <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>, underscoring how swiftly the news of His power traveled.<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s size testifies to Christ&#8217;s authority; it also creates a practical problem&#8212;people pressing in, each desperate to touch Him (<a href="/mark/3-10.htm">Mark 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Command: Jesus asked His disciples</b><p>&#8226; Jesus delegates: &#8220;asked His disciples&#8221; shows He involves followers in ministry logistics, not merely in preaching (cf. <a href="/mark/6-35.htm">Mark 6:35&#8211;37</a>; <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; This highlights responsible leadership&#8212;He foresees danger and moves to protect both Himself and the crowd.

He later uses boats the same way (<a href="/mark/4-1.htm">Mark 4:1</a>; <a href="/luke/5-3.htm">Luke 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical ministry solutions do not diminish the miraculous; they complement it. God&#8217;s people have often coupled faith with wise preparation (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The Sea of Galilee&#8217;s shoreline slopes gently, so a boat would let Jesus address thousands while remaining visible and audible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Purpose: so that the crowd would not crush Him</b><p>&#8226; The phrase reveals genuine physical danger.
