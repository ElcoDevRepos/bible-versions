In ancient Israel, vines and fig trees were common agricultural elements, representing sustenance and economic stability. The imagery suggests a time of abundance where individuals can enjoy the fruits of their labor without fear of invasion or poverty. This vision of peace is reminiscent of Solomon's reign, a period noted for its prosperity and tranquility (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>). The vine and fig tree also have eschatological significance, pointing to the Messianic age when Christ will reign and bring ultimate peace (<a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>).<p><b>with no one to frighten him</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the absence of fear and external threats. In the historical context, Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations, leading to periods of war and captivity. The promise of safety and security is a reversal of these conditions, indicating divine protection and the establishment of God's kingdom. This assurance is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>, where nations will no longer engage in war. It reflects the peace that Christ, the Prince of Peace, will bring in His kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>For the mouth of the LORD of Hosts has spoken</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and authority of the prophecy. The title "LORD of Hosts" highlights God's sovereignty and power over all creation, including heavenly armies. When God speaks, His words are unfailing and trustworthy, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). This assurance is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises, as seen in the covenants with Abraham, Moses, and David. The fulfillment of this prophecy is ultimately found in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's promises and will bring them to completion in His second coming (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of both judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.
