In the context of the ancient Near East, where polytheism was prevalent, this statement highlights the monotheistic belief in Yahweh as the one true God. The rhetorical question underscores God's unparalleled nature, echoing themes found in <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and holiness, setting Him apart from the idols worshiped by surrounding nations.<p><b>who pardons iniquity</b><br>The concept of pardoning iniquity is central to the character of God as revealed in the Old Testament. This phrase reflects God's willingness to forgive sins, a theme that is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>. The Hebrew word for "iniquity" often implies a deep moral failing, yet God&#8217;s grace is sufficient to cover even the gravest of sins. This anticipates the New Testament revelation of forgiveness through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>.<p><b>and passes over the transgression</b><br>This phrase recalls the Passover event in Exodus, where God "passed over" the houses of the Israelites marked with the blood of the lamb. It signifies God's mercy in choosing not to punish His people as they deserve. Theologically, it points to the future sacrifice of Christ, the Lamb of God, whose blood allows God to pass over our sins (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The act of passing over transgressions is a demonstration of divine forbearance and patience.<p><b>of the remnant of His inheritance&#8212;</b><br>The "remnant" refers to the faithful few who remain true to God amidst widespread apostasy. This concept is prevalent in prophetic literature, including Isaiah and Jeremiah, and signifies hope for restoration. The "inheritance" denotes Israel as God's chosen people, a theme rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>. This remnant theology finds fulfillment in the New Testament Church, which is seen as the spiritual Israel (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p><b>who does not retain His anger forever,</b><br>God's anger is depicted as temporary, contrasting with His eternal love and mercy. This reflects His covenantal faithfulness and willingness to restore His people after discipline. The temporary nature of divine anger is echoed in <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3-31.htm">Lamentations 3:31-32</a>. It reassures believers of God's readiness to forgive and restore, emphasizing His compassionate nature.<p><b>because He delights in loving devotion?</b><br>The phrase "loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," often rendered as "steadfast love" or "mercy." It is a key attribute of God, highlighting His covenantal loyalty and kindness. This delight in mercy is a central theme in the prophetic books and is foundational to understanding God's interactions with humanity. It points forward to the New Testament revelation of God's love through Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> and <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel. His prophecies often highlighted social injustices and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is portrayed as merciful and forgiving, contrasting with the human tendency to hold onto anger and grudges.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_his_inheritance.htm">The Remnant of His Inheritance</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful few among the Israelites who remain true to God despite widespread unfaithfulness. This concept of a "remnant" is a recurring theme in the prophetic books.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity_and_transgression.htm">Iniquity and Transgression</a></b><br>These terms refer to sin and wrongdoing. Iniquity implies a moral distortion, while transgression suggests a rebellion against God's law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/loving_devotion.htm">Loving Devotion (Hebrew: Chesed)</a></b><br>A key attribute of God, often translated as "steadfast love" or "mercy," highlighting His covenantal faithfulness and kindness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unique_nature.htm">God's Unique Nature</a></b><br>God is incomparable in His ability to forgive and show mercy. Unlike humans, He does not hold onto anger indefinitely.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>While God is merciful, the call to repentance is implicit.

He stands alone in holiness, power, and mercy. Throughout Scripture, the same rhetorical question underscores His unmatched character&#8212;&#8220;Who among the gods is like You, O LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>) and &#8220;To whom will you liken God?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18</a>). When we read Micah&#8217;s words, we are invited to marvel, not merely to compare. There is literally no rival. Every attribute that follows flows out of this reality: the living God alone is capable of the profound grace described in the rest of the verse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who pardons iniquity</b><p>To &#8220;pardon&#8221; means to lift away guilt so it no longer burdens the sinner. Scripture consistently affirms that God&#8217;s forgiveness is complete:<p>&#8226; &#8220;As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>Micah presents pardon as God&#8217;s active choice, grounded in the substitutionary atonement ultimately fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Because the Lord literally pays the debt, His people stand truly cleansed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and passes over the transgression of the remnant of His inheritance&#8212;</b><p>&#8220;Passes over&#8221; recalls the Passover in <a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, where judgment fell on Egypt but &#8220;passed over&#8221; Israel because of the lamb&#8217;s blood. Micah applies the same picture to the &#8220;remnant&#8221;&#8212;the faithful portion of Israel God preserves by covenant grace (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). He does not pretend sin never happened; He chooses to let the penalty pass by because a substitute has borne it. This pattern reappears in <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12&#8211;13</a>, where the remnant is sheltered, and in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, where Jesus is hailed as &#8220;the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.&#8221; God&#8217;s inheritance, His people, are safe because He Himself provides the escape from wrath.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who does not retain His anger forever,</b><p>God&#8217;s anger is real and righteous, but it is not His final word. &#8220;For His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for a lifetime&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>). After discipline, He restores: &#8220;With everlasting lovingkindness I will have compassion on you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>). The literal promise is that wrath has a limit, set by God&#8217;s own character; once justice is satisfied, He gladly embraces His children again. The cross perfectly displays this equilibrium&#8212;wrath satisfied, love released (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25&#8211;26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because He delights in loving devotion?</b><p>God&#8217;s motivation is not reluctance but delight. &#8220;The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious&#8230; abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a> says He &#8220;delights in loving devotion, justice, and righteousness.&#8221; The Hebrew idea of covenant love (&#7717;esed) speaks of steadfast, loyal kindness. God&#8217;s heart thrills to show it. His pleasure is not in punishing but in saving (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>). Every pardon, every passing over, flows from a joyful, unwavering commitment to love His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18</a> celebrates the singular glory of God: no one compares with Him. He lifts away our guilt, lets judgment pass us by, refuses to keep anger simmering, and does all this because His deepest delight is steadfast covenant love. The verse points straight to the cross of Christ, where God&#8217;s uniqueness, pardon, Passover provision, tempered anger, and delighted love converge in perfect harmony&#8212;for the remnant of faith, and for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Who is a God like unto thee</span>?--Micah, with an allusion to the significance of his own name, concludes his book with a burst of enthusiastic homage to the God of gods. The gracious character here ascribed to Jehovah is unparalleled in the Bible in human utterances; it is the response of the prophet to the glorious words spoken by Jehovah of Himself (<a href="/context/exodus/34-6.htm" title="And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The promise there made to Moses is here extended by the inspiration of the prophet to the Gentiles.
