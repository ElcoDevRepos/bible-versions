In the context of <a href="/micah/2.htm">Micah 2</a>, the prophet has been condemning the injustices and oppression committed by the leaders and wealthy of Israel. The "therefore" signals the impending judgment as a direct consequence of their actions.<p><b>you will have no one</b><br>This phrase suggests a complete absence or lack of representation. It implies that those who have been unjust will be excluded from future blessings and responsibilities. The absence of "no one" highlights the severity of the judgment.<p><b>in the assembly of the LORD</b><br>The "assembly of the LORD" refers to the gathering of God's people, often associated with worship, decision-making, and communal activities. In ancient Israel, this assembly was a place of significant religious and social importance. Being excluded from it meant being cut off from the community and its spiritual life.<p><b>to divide the land by lot.</b><br>Dividing the land by lot was a practice used during the time of Joshua when the Israelites entered the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/14-2.htm">Joshua 14:2</a>). It was a method of distributing land fairly among the tribes, seen as an act under God's guidance. The exclusion from this process signifies a loss of inheritance and blessing. This phrase underscores the gravity of the judgment: those who have acted unjustly will not partake in the future distribution of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, active during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, who spoke against the social injustices and idolatry of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often straying from God's commandments and facing consequences for their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_of_the_lord.htm">The Assembly of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the gathering of God's people, particularly in the context of dividing the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>The Promised Land, a central element of God's covenant with Israel, symbolizing God's provision and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A method used in ancient Israel to distribute land, signifying God's sovereign choice and fairness in the allocation of inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_injustice.htm">Consequences of Injustice</a></b><br><a href="/micah/2-5.htm">Micah 2:5</a> warns of the loss of inheritance due to the unjust actions of the people.
