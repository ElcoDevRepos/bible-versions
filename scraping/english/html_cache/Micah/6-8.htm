The "good" refers to moral and ethical standards that align with God's character. In the context of Micah, the prophet addresses the Israelites, who were familiar with the Law given through Moses. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>, where God outlines what He requires of Israel. The use of "O man" personalizes the message, indicating that these requirements are universal and timeless.<p><b>And what does the LORD require of you</b><br>This question highlights the simplicity and clarity of God's expectations. Unlike the complex sacrificial systems or rituals, God's requirements are straightforward. The term "require" suggests a divine mandate, not optional advice. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where obedience is a response to God's grace and faithfulness.<p><b>but to act justly,</b><br>Justice is a central theme in the Bible, reflecting God's own nature. Acting justly involves fairness, honesty, and integrity in dealings with others. In the historical context, Israel was guilty of social injustices, such as exploitation and corruption. This call to justice is consistent with other prophetic writings, like <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>, which urges justice to "roll on like a river." Justice is also a characteristic of the coming Messiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.<p><b>to love mercy,</b><br>Mercy, or "chesed" in Hebrew, implies loving-kindness, compassion, and loyalty. It is a covenantal term that describes God's steadfast love for His people. Loving mercy goes beyond mere acts of kindness; it involves a heartfelt commitment to show compassion. This reflects God's own merciful nature, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. Jesus exemplified mercy in His ministry, teaching His followers to be merciful as their Father is merciful (<a href="/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>).<p><b>and to walk humbly with your God?</b><br>Walking humbly with God denotes a lifestyle of humility and submission to God's will. It involves recognizing one's dependence on God and aligning one's life with His purposes. This phrase contrasts with the pride and self-reliance often condemned by the prophets. Walking with God is a recurring biblical metaphor for a close, personal relationship with Him, as seen in <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a> with Enoch. Humility is a key attribute of Christ, who humbled Himself in obedience to the Father (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah is known for his messages of judgment and hope.

This verse encapsulates the essence of a life pleasing to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/act_justly.htm">Act Justly</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "justly" (mishpat) implies fairness and righteousness in our dealings with others.

This might well be a comfort to the Israelites when they heard that they were doomed to be cast out of their country, and that the temple was to be destroyed, and that the ritual on which they laid such stress would for a time become impracticable. So the inculcation of moral virtues is often connected with the prediction of woe or captivity. (For the prophetic view of the paramount importance of righteousness, see <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.: 1. 8, etc.; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc.; see on Zechariah 7:7.) <span class="cmt_word">To do justly.</span> To act equitably, to hurt nobody by word or deed, which was the exact contrary of the conduct previously mentioned (<a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1, 2, 8</a>; <a href="/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To love mercy.</span> To be guided in conduct to others by loving kindness. These two rules contain the whole duty to the neighbour. Compare Christ's description of genuine religion (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To walk humbly with thy God.</span> This precept comprises man's duty to God, humility and obedience. "To walk" is an expression implying "to live and act" as the patriarchs are said to have "walked with God," denoting that they lived as consciously under his eye and referred all their actions to him. Humility is greatly enforced in the Scriptures (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, etc.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "to be ready to walk with the Lord;" Vulgate, S<span class="accented">olicitum ambulare</span> <span class="accented">cum Deo</span>; Syriac, "Be prepared to follow thy God."
