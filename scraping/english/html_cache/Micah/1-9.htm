The term "incurable" suggests that the moral and spiritual decay has reached a point beyond remedy, indicating divine judgment is inevitable. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin leading to destruction, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a> with the flood narrative. The imagery of an incurable wound is also used in <a href="/jeremiah/30-12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12-15</a>, emphasizing the severity of Israel's spiritual condition.<p><b>it has reached even Judah;</b><br>The sin and its consequences have spread from Israel to Judah, the Southern Kingdom. This highlights the interconnectedness of the two kingdoms and the pervasive nature of sin. Historically, Judah often followed in the footsteps of Israel's idolatry and rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-19.htm">2 Kings 17:19</a>. This serves as a warning that sin's influence can extend beyond its initial boundaries, affecting others who are nearby.<p><b>it has approached the gate of my people,</b><br>The "gate" symbolizes the place of authority and decision-making in ancient cities. The approach of sin to the gate signifies that the leadership and governance of Judah are now compromised. In biblical times, city gates were where elders and leaders met to discuss and make judgments (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that corruption has infiltrated the highest levels of society.<p><b>as far as Jerusalem itself.</b><br>Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah, is now threatened. This is significant because Jerusalem housed the Temple, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The mention of Jerusalem indicates the seriousness of the situation, as the city was meant to be a beacon of faithfulness to God. The prophecy foreshadows the eventual fall of Jerusalem to Babylon in 586 BC, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>. This also points to the need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would establish a new covenant and restore the relationship between God and His people (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet from Moresheth, who prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

It was often warned by prophets about impending judgment due to sin and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant as the spiritual and political center of the Jewish people.

&#8216;For her wound is incurable&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>a)<p>&#8226; Micah describes the northern kingdom (Samaria, v. 6) as mortally injured, beyond human remedy.<p>&#8226;

Like <a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>, the point is that sin&#8217;s consequences cannot be reversed by political alliances, reforms, or self-help; only divine intervention can save, and that help is being withheld because of hardened rebellion (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase warns us that sin left unchecked leads to an irreversible point of no return (<a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It has reached even Judah</b><p>&#8220;

Micah, a prophet to Judah, sounds the alarm that no covenant privilege exempts God&#8217;s people from discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20-22</a>).<p>&#8226;
