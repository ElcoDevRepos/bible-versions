It reflects the prophet Micah's grief over the moral and spiritual decay of Israel. Similar expressions are found in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>, where prophets express anguish over the state of the people and impending judgment.<p><b>For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard;</b><br>The imagery of gathering summer fruit and gleaning a vineyard suggests a time of harvest, which should be a period of abundance and joy. However, Micah finds himself in a situation where the expected bounty is absent. This metaphor highlights the spiritual barrenness of Israel, where righteousness and justice are lacking. The practice of gleaning, as described in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, was meant to provide for the poor, but here it underscores the absence of spiritual fruit.<p><b>there is no cluster to eat,</b><br>The absence of a cluster of grapes signifies the lack of righteous people in the land. In biblical symbolism, grapes often represent prosperity and blessing (<a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11-12</a>). The lack of a cluster indicates a failure to produce the fruits of righteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is compared to a vineyard that yields wild grapes instead of good fruit.<p><b>no early fig that I crave.</b><br>Early figs were considered a delicacy and a sign of the first fruits of the harvest (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). The craving for early figs represents a longing for the first signs of repentance and righteousness among the people. The absence of these figs indicates a spiritual drought, similar to the barren fig tree cursed by Jesus in <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>, symbolizing unfruitfulness and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah is the author of the book. He prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. His messages often focused on social justice and the coming judgment due to the people's sins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Micah directed much of his prophecy. During Micah's time, Judah was experiencing moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/summer_fruit_and_vineyard.htm">Summer Fruit and Vineyard</a></b><br>These are metaphors used by Micah to describe the spiritual barrenness and moral decay of the people.

The absence of the early fig symbolizes a lack of spiritual nourishment and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gleaning.htm">Gleaning</a></b><br>The act of collecting leftover crops after the harvest.

By opening with &#8220;woe,&#8221; he signals judgment that is both deserved and imminent, just as Jesus later pronounced woes over unrepentant cities (<a href="/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal accuracy of Scripture assures us that this is more than emotion&#8212;it is prophetic truth announcing that God takes wickedness seriously.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I am like one gathering summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard;</b><p>Micah pictures himself arriving after the harvest, hoping for a few leftover grapes.<p>&#8226; Gleaning was God&#8217;s provision for the poor (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2-3</a>). By law, some fruit should remain, but here the field is stripped bare.<p>&#8226; Amos saw a similar vision of &#8220;a basket of summer fruit&#8221; symbolizing Israel&#8217;s end (<a href="/amos/8-1.htm">Amos 8:1-2</a>), showing that late-season fruit can be a metaphor for the final stage before judgment.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s comparison is literal&#8212;he stands in a land once fruitful&#8212;yet also moral: the vineyard represents the people (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). What should have been a place of abundance now yields nothing lasting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is no cluster to eat,</b><p>The search turns up no bunch of grapes, no nourishing reward.<p>&#8226; God looked &#8220;for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>, corrupt Israel is compared to &#8220;the grapes of Sodom.&#8221; Micah echoes that verdict: the nation&#8217;s sins have dried up its spiritual fruit.<p>&#8226; The absence of a single cluster underscores total scarcity. Even a righteous remnant seems missing, recalling Elijah&#8217;s fear that he alone was left (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>)&#8212;though God always preserves a faithful few (<a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no early fig that I crave.</b><p>Early figs were the first, sweetest produce of the season, eagerly anticipated by travelers (<a href="/mark/11-13.htm">Mark 11:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God once delighted in Israel &#8220;like grapes in the wilderness; I viewed your fathers as the firstfruit on the fig tree in its first season&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). That joy has vanished.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah was shown &#8220;good figs, very good&#8221; symbolizing the obedient exiles, and &#8220;bad figs, very bad&#8221; for the rebellious (<a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-3</a>). Micah sees only the latter.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s craving highlights God&#8217;s own desire for genuine righteousness. When none appears, judgment follows&#8212;yet the longing itself reveals His heart, pointing ahead to the promise that He will one day produce fruit in His people (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Micah&#8217;s brief lament paints a vivid picture: standing in a once-fertile vineyard, he finds nothing&#8212;no clusters, no first-ripe figs&#8212;symbolizing a society emptied of godly character. Scripture&#8217;s other &#8220;woes,&#8221; vineyard parables, and fruit metaphors confirm that this desolation is real, deserved, and tragic. Yet God&#8217;s very hunger for early fruit hints at hope: He still seeks and will ultimately raise up a faithful harvest through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Woe is me!</span>--Micah gives here a fearful picture of the demoralised state of society in Judah which had called down the vengeance of God. As the early fig gathered in June is eagerly sought for by the traveller, so the prophet sought anxiously for a good man; but his experience was that of the Psalmist: "The godly man ceaseth; the faithful fail from among the children of men."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> &sect; 5. <span class="accented">Israel's penitential acknowledgment of the general corruption.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me!</span> (<a href="/job/10-15.htm">Job 10:15</a>).

At the fruit. harvest no early figs are to be found, and (in the next clause) after the vintage no more grapes; so in Israel there is none righteous left. The Septuagint gives a plainer exposition, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I became as one that gathereth straw in harvest;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Factus sum sicut qui collegit in autumno racemos vindimiae</span>, joining the two clauses together.
