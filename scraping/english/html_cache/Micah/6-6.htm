In the Old Testament, approaching God required adherence to specific rituals and sacrifices as outlined in the Mosaic Law. The question implies a desire to understand the requirements for worship and relationship with God. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>, which asks who may ascend the hill of the Lord and stand in His holy place, emphasizing purity and righteousness.<p><b>when I bow before the God on high?</b><br>Bowing signifies an act of worship and submission, acknowledging God's sovereignty and majesty. The phrase "God on high" underscores His exalted position above all creation. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's transcendence, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, where God is described as dwelling in a high and holy place. The act of bowing also connects to the cultural practices of showing reverence to a king or deity.<p><b>Should I come to Him with burnt offerings,</b><br>Burnt offerings were a central part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. <a href="/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a> details the procedures for these offerings, which were to be completely consumed by fire, representing total surrender to God. The question here suggests a reflection on whether external rituals alone are sufficient to please God, a theme also explored in <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice.<p><b>with year-old calves?</b><br>Year-old calves were considered prime offerings due to their value and purity, as specified in <a href="/leviticus/9-3.htm">Leviticus 9:3</a>. Offering such a valuable sacrifice indicates a desire to give God the best. However, the rhetorical nature of the question suggests a deeper inquiry into the nature of true worship. This anticipates the prophetic emphasis on justice, mercy, and humility over mere ritual, as later highlighted in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. The mention of calves also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who fulfills and transcends the sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.

Dean Stanley writes, after his picturesque manner, of "the short dialogue preserved, not by the Mosaic historian, but by the Prophet Micah, which at once exhibits the agony of the king and the lofty conceptions of the great Seer" (<span class= "ital">Jewish Church,</span> Lect. 8). But it is rather in harmony with the context to understand it as the alarmed and conscience-stricken reply of the Jewish people impersonated in some earnest speaker to the pleading brought before them by the prophet in the Lord's name.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-8.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The people, awakened to its ingratitude and need of atonement, asks how to please God, and is referred for answer to the moral requirements of the Law.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - It is greatly doubted who is the speaker here. Bishop Butler, in his sermon "Upon the Character of Balaam," adopts the view that Balak is the speaker of vers. 6 and 7, and Balaam answers in ver. 8. Knabenbauer considers Micah himself as the interlocutor, speaking in the character of the people; which makes the apparent change of persons in ver. 8 very awkward. Most commentators, ancient and modern, take the questions in vers. 6 and 7 to be asked by the people personified, though they are not agreed as to the spirit from which they proceed, some thinking that they are uttered in self-righteousness, as if the speakers had done all that and more than could be required of them; others regarding the inquiries as representing a certain acknowledgment of sin and a desire for means of propitiation, though there is exhibited a want of appreciation of the nature of God and of the service which alone is acceptable to him. The latter view is most reasonable, and in accordance with Micah's manner. <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with what offering?
