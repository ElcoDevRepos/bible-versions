It is a common biblical expression found in prophetic literature, indicating a time when God's purposes will be fully realized. This eschatological term is also used in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, suggesting a period of divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>the mountain of the house of the LORD</b><br>This refers to Mount Zion in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. In biblical symbolism, mountains often represent places of divine revelation and presence. The "house of the LORD" signifies the temple, a central place of worship and God's dwelling among His people. This imagery points to a future exaltation of God's presence and authority.<p><b>will be established as the chief of the mountains</b><br>This indicates a future elevation of Mount Zion above all other mountains, symbolizing the supreme authority and preeminence of God's kingdom. In ancient Near Eastern culture, mountains were often seen as the dwelling places of gods, so this statement emphasizes the superiority of the God of Israel over all other deities and religious systems.<p><b>it will be raised above the hills</b><br>This further emphasizes the exaltation and prominence of God's kingdom. The raising of the mountain signifies the ultimate triumph and visibility of God's rule. It suggests a transformation where God's presence and authority are recognized universally, surpassing all other powers and authorities.<p><b>and the peoples will stream to it</b><br>This phrase envisions a time when all nations will be drawn to the worship of the true God. It reflects the universal scope of God's salvation plan, where people from every nation will seek the Lord.

As the third chapter commenced with a startling denunciation, following immediately upon the predicted blessings of the restored kingdom, so upon that chapter, closed in deepest gloom, there now rises a vision of glorious light. The first three verses are almost identical with the second chapter of Isaiah, <a href="/context/micah/4-2.htm" title="And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Micah 4:2-4</a>; and it has been almost an open question which of the two prophets is the original author of them, or whether indeed they both adopted the words from an older prophecy current at the time. Dr. Pusey takes very decided ground, saying, "It is now owned, well-nigh on all hands, that the great prophecy, three verses of which Isaiah prefixed to his second chapter, was originally delivered by Micah. . . . No one now thinks Micah adopted that great prophecy from Isaiah" (<span class= "ital">Minor Prophets,</span> p. 289). This last statement, however, is far too sweeping; all that can be correctly said is that the preponderance of opinion is in favour of Micah being regarded as the original writer.<p><span class= "bld">In the top of the mountains</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the mountain of the Lord's house shall be spiritually elevated above all else, visible and invisible, and it shall be established for ever.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-5.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">The prophet suddenly announces the future glory of the temple mountain and the ideal happiness of the people</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. There is no adversative particle here; the verse is merely connected with what precedes without any expressed contrast. What is implied is that it was impossible that the temple, to which God's high promises attached, should lie waste forever. The passage, vers. 1-3, occurs in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>, The question as to which prophecy is the earlier cannot be settled. Possibly both prophets borrowed the language of some earlier work, as Isaiah is thought to have done on other occasions, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>. and 16. the community of ideas leading them to the same source of testimony. <span class="cmt_word">In the last days;</span> literally, <span class="accented">at the end of the days</span>; Cheyne, "in the days to come." It is the usual phrase to designate the time of Messiah, unto which the prophet's thoughts are directed, and for which all preceding events and periods are a preparation (<a href="/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>).

The phrase may often suitably be rendered, "in latter days," as spoken not absolutely, but relatively to preceding times. <span class="cmt_word">The mountain of the house of the Lord.</span> Mount Moriah, the ruin of which was foretold (<a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>).

The prophet speaks as if he contemplated a physical change, expressing thereby with singular force the notion that the worship of the true God (of which the temple was the symbol) shall be promulgated among all nations of the world; that from the old Jewish centre of religion a new order of things shall arise, not transitory, nor local, but extending to all time and pervading the utmost parts of the earth. <span class="cmt_word">And people</span> (<span class="accented">peoples</span>) <span class="cmt_word">shall flow unto it.</span> The prophet beholds the nations of the world coming up in formal procession to join in the service of the temple. Thus is adumbrated the comprehension of all nations in the Catholic Church.
