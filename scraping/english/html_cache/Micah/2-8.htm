Historically, Israel was chosen to be a light to the nations, but their actions have made them adversaries to God's purposes. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament where Israel turns away from God, as in <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>. The imagery of rising up "like an enemy" underscores the severity of their rebellion, akin to the betrayal seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>.<p><b>You strip off the splendid robe from unsuspecting passersby:</b><br>The act of stripping a robe symbolizes not only theft but also humiliation and violation of personal dignity. In ancient Near Eastern culture, clothing was a significant indicator of social status and identity. The "splendid robe" suggests that the victims were people of some standing or wealth. This behavior is reminiscent of the injustices condemned by other prophets, such as <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-8</a>, where the exploitation of the vulnerable is a recurring theme. The stripping of garments can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual nakedness and shame, as in <a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17-18</a>.<p><b>like men returning from battle.</b><br>This simile suggests a ruthless and aggressive action, as soldiers would strip the defeated of their possessions after a battle. It implies a sense of entitlement and conquest, even though the victims are not enemies but fellow Israelites. This behavior contrasts sharply with the expected conduct of God's people, who are called to love their neighbors (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The imagery of battle here may also foreshadow the coming judgment and destruction that will befall Israel due to their sins, as prophesied in <a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> and fulfilled in the Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.
