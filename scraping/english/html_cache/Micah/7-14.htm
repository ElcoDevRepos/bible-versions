The staff symbolizes authority and the ability to lead and protect. The "flock of Your inheritance" refers to Israel, God's chosen people, whom He has set apart as His own. This imagery is consistent with passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides and cares for His sheep. The concept of inheritance underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting their special status and the promises made to the patriarchs.<p><b>They live alone in a woodland, surrounded by pastures.</b><br>This phrase suggests a setting of isolation and provision. The "woodland" can symbolize a place of refuge and seclusion, where the people are set apart from other nations. The surrounding pastures indicate abundance and sustenance, suggesting that God provides for His people even in their solitude. This imagery may reflect the historical context of Israel's separation from other nations and their reliance on God for sustenance. It also echoes the wilderness experience of the Israelites, where they were dependent on God's provision.<p><b>Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</b><br>Bashan and Gilead were regions known for their fertile land and rich pastures, making them ideal for grazing livestock. This reference to "the days of old" likely alludes to a time of prosperity and blessing in Israel's history, possibly during the reigns of David and Solomon when the nation experienced peace and abundance. The mention of these regions serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and provision, encouraging hope for future restoration. This phrase also connects to the prophetic theme of restoration and return to a state of blessing, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_god.htm">The People of God</a></b><br>Referred to as "the flock of Your inheritance," this represents the Israelites, God's chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphor for God, who is asked to guide and protect His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A region known for its fertile land and rich pastures, symbolizing abundance and blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>Another region known for its balm and fertile land, representing healing and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_shepherd.htm">God as Shepherd</a></b><br>Recognize God's role as the ultimate guide and protector in our lives.

A shepherd&#8217;s staff both protects and directs; it nudges wandering sheep back onto safe paths and wards off predators.<p>- <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a> echoes the same comforting image: &#8220;Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.&#8221;<p>- Jesus later applies this role to Himself: &#8220;I am the good shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), confirming that God&#8217;s personal care did not end with Micah&#8217;s day.<p>- The plea &#8220;Shepherd with Your staff&#8221; is therefore a confident request that God exercise His proven, hands-on leadership over His people once more.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your people, the flock of Your inheritance</b><p>- The petition names Israel as God&#8217;s own possession. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a> states, &#8220;For the LORD&#8217;s portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His inheritance.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> reinforces the identity: &#8220;We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.&#8221;<p>- Because God Himself secured and treasures this &#8220;inheritance,&#8221; His commitment to shepherd them is rooted in covenant faithfulness, not their performance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They live alone in a woodland</b><p>- The phrase recalls <a href="/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>, where Israel is called &#8220;a people dwelling alone.&#8221; Isolation often described their condition in exile or dispersion&#8212;surrounded by hostile nations yet preserved by God.<p>- &#8220;Woodland&#8221; hints at vulnerability: sheep in thick brush are easy prey. The petition recognizes Israel&#8217;s exposed, scattered state and turns to the only reliable Protector.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surrounded by pastures</b><p>- In contrast to the tangled woodland, pastures picture abundance and rest. <a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a> promises, &#8220;I will feed them in a good pasture.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a> celebrates that same provision: &#8220;He makes me lie down in green pastures.&#8221;<p>- Micah&#8217;s wording anticipates a reversal&#8212;from scarcity and danger to open, nourishing fields under the Shepherd&#8217;s guard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead</b><p>- Bashan and Gilead, east of the Jordan, were famed for rich grazing land (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-10.htm">Deuteronomy 3:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>).<p>- By citing these specific regions, Micah asks for a literal return to historically fruitful territory&#8212;a restoration that signals complete renewal.<p>- <a href="/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a> echoes the hope: &#8220;I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As in the days of old</b><p>- The benchmark for blessing is God&#8217;s own past deeds. <a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11</a> says, &#8220;I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/malachi/3-4.htm">Malachi 3:4</a> anticipates sacrifices becoming &#8220;pleasing to the LORD as in days gone by.&#8221;<p>- Micah&#8217;s prayer trusts the unchanging character of God: what He did before, He can and will do again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a> is a heartfelt appeal for the Lord to resume His visible, protective leadership over Israel. Using shepherd imagery, covenant language, and memories of fertile Bashan and Gilead, the prophet asks God to gather His scattered flock, feed them abundantly, and restore them to the fullness they once knew. The verse underscores God&#8217;s unwavering ownership of His people and His power to turn bleak isolation into overflowing pasture&#8212;yesterday, today, and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Feed thy people with thy rod</span>.--Or, <span class= "ital">with thy shepherd</span>'<span class= "ital">s crook.</span> The prophet lifts up his prayer for the people, either dwelling "alone" among the idolaters of Babylon--among them, but not of them--or living a nation, mysteriously apart from other nations, returned from Babylon, and settled on the fruitful mountain range of Carmel, or in the rich pasture land on the east of Jordan.
