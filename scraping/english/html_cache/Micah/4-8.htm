In biblical times, a watchtower was a high place used for guarding and overseeing the land. The "watchtower of the flock" can symbolize God's protective oversight of His people, Israel. It also alludes to the role of leaders and prophets who are tasked with guiding and safeguarding the spiritual well-being of the community. The imagery of a shepherd is frequently used in the Bible to describe God's care for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>O stronghold of the Daughter of Zion</b><br>The "Daughter of Zion" is a poetic term for the city of Jerusalem and its inhabitants. A stronghold signifies a place of refuge and defense, indicating that Jerusalem is a fortified city under God's protection. Historically, Jerusalem was a central and strategic city in the ancient Near East, often under threat from surrounding nations. The term "stronghold" emphasizes God's promise to protect and preserve His people despite external threats. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate security and peace that will come through the Messiah, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p><b>the former dominion will be restored to you</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the restoration of Israel's past glory and sovereignty. Historically, Israel experienced periods of great prosperity and influence, particularly during the reigns of King David and King Solomon. The promise of restoration implies a return to a time of peace, prosperity, and divine favor. This restoration is not only political but also spiritual, as it points to the coming of the Messiah who will establish an everlasting kingdom. The theme of restoration is prevalent throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a>.<p><b>sovereignty will come to the Daughter of Jerusalem</b><br>This phrase indicates the establishment of a rightful and divine rule over Jerusalem. The "Daughter of Jerusalem" again refers to the city and its people, highlighting their central role in God's redemptive plan. Sovereignty implies not just political power but also spiritual authority, which will be fully realized in the messianic age. This prophecy finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). The promise of sovereignty reassures the faithful of God's unchanging covenant and His plan to bring about His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/watchtower_of_the_flock.htm">Watchtower of the Flock</a></b><br>This term refers to a place of vigilance and protection, often associated with shepherds watching over their sheep.

This is a more satisfactory interpretation than that which makes the tower of the flock <span class= "ital">Migdol-Edah</span> (<a href="/genesis/35-21.htm" title="And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.">Genesis 35:21</a>), a place near Bethlehem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">After a certain period of calamity and captivity the kingdom of David shall be revived.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, O tower of the flock</span> (<span class="accented">migdal-edar</span>). There was a village with a tower so called near Bethlehem (<a href="/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>), and it is thought that Micah refers to it as the home of David and as destined to be the birthplace of Messiah. But the context compels us to consider the expression as a periphrasis for Jerusalem, which the prophet here addressee, declaring that the royal power shall be restored to her. It is evidently the same place as <span class="cmt_word">the stronghold</span> (<span class="accented">ophel</span>, "the hill") <span class="cmt_word">of the daughter of Zion.</span> The name "Ophel" is affixed to the southern spur of Moriah, opposite to the Mount Zion, from which it was separated by the Tyropoeon Valley. It was fortified by Jotham (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>), and on it were the king's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old palace of David, and "the tower that lieth out," or the upper tower (see <a href="/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26, 27</a>). This is probably the "flock tower" mentioned in the text (comp. <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>, where Ophel and the watch tower are named together); and it is so called as having been originally a place of refuge for flocks, or of observation for shepherds. Micah uses the two expressions to represent the power and dominion of Jerusalem. The propriety of the usa of the term "flock tower" is seen when we remember that David was a shepherd before he was king, and that the Israelites are the sheep of the Lord's pasture. The reference to a flock in the prceeding verses may also have influenced the prophet's thought. Owing to a slight variation in the reading, the LXX. renders <span class="accented">Ophel</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "dark;" so Jerome, "nebulosa;" Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These translators would refer the term to the ruinous condition of the tower. The first dominion shall come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former, original empire, such as it was in the days of David and Solomon, and which had been lost in later times. The LXX. adds, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and hence the Greek expositors explain the passage as referring to the siege of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans. The kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem. The verb "shall come" is better taken with "the first dominion," and this clause in apposition to the former, "the kingdom of" or "the reign over the daughter of Jerusalem." Sovereignty over Jerusalem, or, as others take it, that appertains to Jerusalem, represents rule over the whole country. In Messiah the glory and power are restored to the throne of David (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32, 33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
