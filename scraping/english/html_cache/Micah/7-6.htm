In ancient Israel, honoring one's parents was a fundamental commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The family unit was central to the social and religious life of the community. The dishonoring of a father by a son indicates a rebellion against established authority and tradition, which was seen as a grave sin. This breakdown is indicative of the moral and spiritual decline that Micah is addressing.<p><b>a daughter rises against her mother</b><br>The relationship between a mother and daughter was traditionally one of closeness and mutual support. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women often relied on each other for guidance and assistance in domestic and social matters. A daughter rising against her mother signifies a disruption of these natural bonds and reflects a broader societal disintegration. This mirrors the prophetic warnings found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>, where social chaos is depicted as a consequence of turning away from God.<p><b>and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law</b><br>The relationship between a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law was often complex but crucial in maintaining family harmony. In the biblical narrative, the story of Ruth and Naomi exemplifies a positive relationship between a daughter-in-law and mother-in-law. However, Micah's prophecy highlights the inversion of this ideal, suggesting a time of conflict and division within the family structure. This internal strife is emblematic of the larger societal issues that arise when God's laws are neglected.<p><b>A man&#8217;s enemies are the members of his own household</b><br>This phrase underscores the ultimate breakdown of trust and unity within the most intimate social unit&#8212;the family. It echoes Jesus' words in <a href="/matthew/10-36.htm">Matthew 10:36</a>, where He warns that following Him may lead to division even among close family members. This internal conflict serves as a metaphor for the spiritual battle between faithfulness to God and the pressures of a sinful world. The household, once a place of refuge and support, becomes a battleground, illustrating the pervasive impact of sin and the need for divine intervention and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_israel.htm">Judah and Israel</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often straying from God's commandments and facing consequences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>The verse specifically mentions familial relationships&#8212;father, mother, son, daughter, and in-laws&#8212;highlighting the breakdown of family unity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a></b><br>Represents the intimate and foundational social unit, which is depicted as a place of conflict in this context.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_context.htm">Prophetic Context</a></b><br>Micah's prophecy speaks to the moral and social decay of the time, reflecting broader societal issues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_division.htm">The Reality of Division</a></b><br>Understand that following God can lead to division, even within families.

When Micah depicts hostility instead, it shows:<p>&#8226; Rejection of wisdom&#8212;<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a> urges, &#8220;Do not forsake your mother&#8217;s teaching.&#8221; Conflict here reflects despising what is good.<p>&#8226; Inversion of roles&#8212;children asserting authority over parents (cf. <a href="/isaiah/3-4.htm">Isaiah 3:4-5</a>) is a hallmark of national decline.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s assessment: broken homes mirror broken covenant; the inside turmoil exposes an outside rebellion against Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law</b><p>Extended family was vital in ancient Israel, providing security and inheritance.<p>&#8226; The book of Ruth offers a positive contrast: Ruth&#8217;s loyalty to Naomi (&#8220;Where you go I will go,&#8221; <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>) shows what covenant faithfulness looks like. Micah flips that picture, highlighting covenant unfaithfulness.<p>&#8226; Division spreads outward&#8212;if newly&#8208;married couples cannot unite with their elders, the next generation begins fractured, threatening future faith transmission (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter warns that unbelievers may &#8220;heap abuse&#8221; on believers (<a href="/1_peter/4-4.htm">1 Peter 4:4</a>); sometimes that abuse comes from relatives who once shouldered blessings together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A man&#8217;s enemies are the members of his own household</b><p>Micah gathers the three examples into one overarching lament: internal betrayal.<p>&#8226; David felt this pain: &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230;has lifted up his heel against me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus quotes Micah word-for-word to illustrate the cost of following Him (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34-36</a>; <a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>). When truth divides, hostility can erupt closest to home.<p>&#8226; Paul foretells &#8220;disobedient to parents&#8230;without natural affection&#8221; as signs of &#8220;terrible times&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a>). Micah&#8217;s day previews every age when culture rejects God.<p>&#8226; Hope remains: those wounded by household enemies can look to One who &#8220;came to His own, and His own did not receive Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>), yet overcame betrayal with redeeming love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a> paints a heartbreaking picture of families imploding&#8212;sons, daughters, and in-laws turning against those they should honor and cherish. It proves how deeply sin corrodes, starting at home, and anticipates the divisions Jesus said would surface when His truth confronts human rebellion. Yet the verse also serves as a wake-up call: cherish God&#8217;s design for family, uphold His Word, and find comfort that the Savior who endured betrayal offers grace and steadfast love for every household that turns back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the son dishonoureth;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">contumeliam facit</span>; literally, <span class="accented">treats as a fool, despises</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6, 15</a>).
