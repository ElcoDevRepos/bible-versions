The use of "therefore" connects this judgment to the preceding verses, where God outlines the people's injustices and lack of faithfulness. The severity of the strike suggests a divine discipline meant to bring about repentance. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The concept of God striking His people can be seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5-6</a>, where God disciplines Israel for their rebellion.<p><b>to ruin you</b><br>The purpose of the striking is to bring about ruin, which in the biblical context often refers to the destruction of cities, loss of land, or exile. This is a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to desolation. Historically, this prophecy was realized through the Assyrian and Babylonian invasions, which led to the fall of Samaria and Jerusalem. Theologically, ruin serves as a means to bring the people back to God, highlighting His justice and mercy.<p><b>because of your sins</b><br>The cause of the judgment is explicitly stated as the people's sins. This underscores the biblical principle that sin leads to separation from God and its consequences. The sins of Israel included idolatry, social injustice, and corruption, as detailed earlier in Micah. This aligns with the prophetic tradition where prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Amos called out similar transgressions. The mention of sin also points to the need for atonement, which in the New Testament is fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who bears the sins of humanity (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.
