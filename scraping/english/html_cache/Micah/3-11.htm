In biblical times, leaders were expected to uphold justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, which commands judges to judge fairly without partiality or bribery. The acceptance of bribes perverts justice and is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>, <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). This corruption reflects a broader societal decay and a departure from God's laws.<p><b>Her priests teach for a price</b><br>The priests, who were supposed to be spiritual leaders and teachers of God's law (<a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>, <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>), were instead motivated by financial gain. This mirrors the situation in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, where Eli's sons abused their priestly roles for personal profit. The commercialization of spiritual duties undermines the integrity of religious instruction and leads to a distortion of God's truth.<p><b>And her prophets practice divination for money</b><br>Prophets were meant to be God's mouthpieces, delivering His messages to the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-22</a>). However, these prophets were engaging in divination, a practice forbidden in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, and doing so for monetary gain. This reflects a betrayal of their divine calling and aligns them with false prophets condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>. Their actions contrast with true prophets like Micah, who spoke God's truth without regard for personal gain.<p><b>Yet they lean upon the LORD, saying, &#8220;Is not the LORD among us? No disaster can come upon us.&#8221;</b><br>Despite their corruption, the leaders, priests, and prophets falsely claimed divine favor and protection. This presumption is reminiscent of the false security condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, where the people believed the presence of the temple guaranteed safety. Their misplaced confidence ignored the conditional nature of God's covenant, which required obedience (Deuteronomy 28). This false assurance is a warning against complacency and presumption upon God's grace without true repentance and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders.htm">Leaders</a></b><br>Refers to the rulers of Israel who were expected to uphold justice but were instead corrupt, accepting bribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for teaching God's law, who were exploiting their position for financial gain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Those who claimed to speak on behalf of God but were practicing divination for money, misleading the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom Micah was prophesying, specifically addressing the corruption within its leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who delivered messages of judgment and hope to Israel during a time of moral and spiritual decay.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/corruption_in_leadership.htm">Corruption in Leadership</a></b><br>Recognize the dangers of leaders who prioritize personal gain over justice and righteousness.
