In biblical context, licking the dust is a metaphor for subjugation and disgrace, reminiscent of the curse placed upon the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>. The serpent, a symbol of Satan and evil, was condemned to crawl on its belly and eat dust. This imagery suggests that the enemies of God will be brought low, experiencing utter defeat and shame. It reflects the ultimate triumph of God's justice over wickedness.<p><b>like reptiles slithering on the ground</b><br>Reptiles slithering on the ground further emphasize the theme of abasement. In ancient Near Eastern culture, snakes and reptiles were often associated with danger and deceit. This phrase underscores the complete subjugation of those who oppose God, reduced to a state of vulnerability and powerlessness. It also alludes to the natural order established by God, where the proud are humbled.<p><b>They will come trembling from their strongholds</b><br>The strongholds represent places of perceived safety and power. Historically, fortified cities and strongholds were symbols of human strength and security. The trembling of those within these strongholds indicates a recognition of the futility of relying on human defenses against divine power. This echoes the fear and awe experienced by nations when confronted with the might of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where the inhabitants of Jericho trembled at the approach of the Israelites.<p><b>in the presence of the LORD our God</b><br>The presence of the LORD signifies His active involvement and sovereignty over the affairs of the world. Throughout the Bible, the presence of God is associated with both judgment and deliverance. This phrase highlights the divine authority and power that causes even the mightiest to tremble. It is a reminder of God's covenant relationship with His people, as He acts on their behalf against their enemies.<p><b>they will tremble in fear of You</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with reverence, awe, and recognition of His holiness and power. This trembling fear is not merely terror but an acknowledgment of God's supreme authority and righteousness. It reflects the eschatological hope that all nations will ultimately recognize and submit to God's rule, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where every knee will bow to Him. This fear underscores the ultimate victory of God's kingdom and the establishment of His justice on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the enemies of Israel who will be humbled and brought low before God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_our_god.htm">The LORD our God</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign over all nations and will ultimately be revered by them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reptiles/snakes.htm">Reptiles/Snakes</a></b><br>Symbolic imagery used to describe the humbled state of the nations before God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dens.htm">Dens</a></b><br>Represents places of hiding or retreat, from which the nations will emerge in fear and submission to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>The imagery of licking dust like a snake emphasizes the need for humility before God.
