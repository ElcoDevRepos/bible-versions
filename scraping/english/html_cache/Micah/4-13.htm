The imagery of threshing is agricultural, symbolizing judgment and separation, as grain is separated from chaff. In biblical context, Zion often represents the spiritual center of God's people. The call to "rise and thresh" suggests a divine empowerment for victory over enemies, echoing themes found in <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15-16</a>, where God promises to make Israel a threshing sledge.<p><b>for I will give you horns of iron and hooves of bronze</b><br>Horns in biblical literature often symbolize strength and power, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>. Iron and bronze denote durability and invincibility, suggesting that God will equip His people with the strength needed to overcome their adversaries. This imagery reflects the divine empowerment and protection promised to God's people, reminiscent of the strength given to the judges and kings of Israel.<p><b>to break to pieces many peoples</b><br>This phrase indicates a future victory over nations that oppose God's people. The breaking of nations can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would possess the gates of their enemies (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<p><b>Then you will devote their gain to the LORD</b><br>The act of devoting gain to the LORD signifies consecration and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. In biblical history, spoils of war were often dedicated to God as a sign of gratitude and recognition of His provision, as seen in <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>. This reflects the principle that all victories and blessings are ultimately for God's glory.<p><b>their wealth to the Lord of all the earth</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's universal dominion. The title "Lord of all the earth" underscores His authority over all creation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>. The dedication of wealth to God signifies the submission of all nations to His rule, pointing to the eschatological vision where every knee will bow to Christ (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>). This also prefigures the gathering of the nations in the Messianic kingdom, where all will acknowledge God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_zion.htm">Daughter of Zion</a></b><br>This term refers to the people of Jerusalem or the inhabitants of Judah.
