This concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing God's preservation of a faithful group despite widespread unfaithfulness. The remnant is often seen as a seed for future restoration and blessing, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12-13</a>. This remnant is significant in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, pointing to the faithful who will inherit the promises made to Abraham.<p><b>will be in the midst of many peoples</b><br>This phrase suggests that the remnant will be dispersed among various nations, reflecting the historical context of the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. However, it also implies a future hope where the remnant's presence among the nations serves a divine purpose. This dispersion can be seen as a precursor to the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where the followers of Christ are sent to all nations, indicating the universal scope of God's salvation plan.<p><b>like dew from the LORD</b><br>Dew is a symbol of blessing and life, especially in the arid climate of the Near East where water is precious. Dew from the LORD signifies divine favor and sustenance, independent of human effort. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>, where God promises to be like dew to Israel, bringing growth and renewal. It underscores the idea that the remnant's influence and blessing among the nations are divinely ordained and not reliant on human strength.<p><b>like showers on the grass</b><br>Showers, like dew, are a source of nourishment and growth, symbolizing God's provision and care. This imagery highlights the refreshing and life-giving presence of the remnant among the nations. It echoes the promise of spiritual renewal and abundance found in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/34-26.htm">Ezekiel 34:26</a>, where God promises showers of blessing. The showers represent the outpouring of God's Spirit, as seen in <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-29</a>, which is fulfilled in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> at Pentecost.<p><b>which do not wait for man or linger for mankind</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the sovereignty and initiative of God in His dealings with humanity. The blessings symbolized by dew and showers are not contingent upon human action or timing but are acts of divine grace. This reflects the biblical theme of God's unmerited favor, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where salvation is described as a gift from God. It underscores the idea that God's purposes will be accomplished according to His will and timing, independent of human intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, specifically the faithful remnant that remains true to God amidst adversity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant.htm">The Remnant</a></b><br>A recurring theme in the Bible, referring to a small, faithful group of God's people preserved through trials.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/many_peoples.htm">Many Peoples</a></b><br>Symbolizes the nations of the world among whom the remnant of Jacob will be dispersed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dew_from_the_lord.htm">Dew from the LORD</a></b><br>A metaphor for the refreshing and life-giving presence of God's people among the nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/showers_on_the_grass.htm">Showers on the Grass</a></b><br>Illustrates the nourishing and sustaining influence of the remnant, independent of human intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_remnant.htm">The Faithful Remnant</a></b><br>God always preserves a faithful remnant, even in times of widespread unfaithfulness.
