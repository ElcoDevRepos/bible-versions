The name "Maroth" is derived from the Hebrew word for "bitterness," which may reflect the town's experience or the nature of its inhabitants' suffering. The phrase "pined for good" suggests a longing or hope for relief and prosperity amidst adversity. This reflects a common theme in the prophetic books, where the people of Israel and Judah often yearn for deliverance from their troubles. The longing for good can be seen as a desire for God's blessing and favor, which is a recurring motif throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>but calamity came down from the LORD</b><br>The calamity mentioned here is understood as divine judgment. In the context of Micah's prophecy, this refers to the impending Assyrian invasion, which was a tool of God's judgment against the sins of Israel and Judah. The phrase emphasizes the sovereignty of God in using nations to execute His judgment, a theme also found in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah. This calamity serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments and the importance of repentance.<p><b>even to the gate of Jerusalem</b><br>The mention of Jerusalem's gate signifies the extent of the calamity, reaching even the capital city of Judah. Jerusalem, often seen as the spiritual and political center of the nation, was considered a place of refuge and divine protection. However, the prophecy indicates that even Jerusalem would not be spared from the consequences of the nation's sins. This foreshadows the eventual siege and fall of Jerusalem, which is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>. The reference to the gate highlights the vulnerability of the city and serves as a warning to its inhabitants to heed the prophetic message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/maroth.htm">Maroth</a></b><br>A town mentioned in the prophecy of Micah, whose name means "bitterness."
