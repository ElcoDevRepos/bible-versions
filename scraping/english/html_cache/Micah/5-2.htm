Ephrathah refers to the region or clan associated with Bethlehem, distinguishing it from another Bethlehem in Zebulun. This prophecy highlights the town's humble status, yet it is chosen for a monumental event. Archaeological evidence supports Bethlehem's ancient existence, and its mention here underscores God's pattern of using the humble for His purposes.<p><b>who are small among the clans of Judah</b><br>Bethlehem's insignificance among the larger and more prominent clans of Judah emphasizes God's tendency to choose the least likely places and people for His divine plans. This reflects the biblical theme of God exalting the humble (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). Historically, Bethlehem was not a major city, reinforcing the idea that God's ways are not man's ways.<p><b>out of you will come forth for Me One to be ruler over Israel</b><br>This prophecy foretells the coming of a ruler from Bethlehem, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as confirmed in <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-6</a>.

It connects to the concept of Jesus as the Word, who was with God in the beginning (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). The "origins of old" imply a divine nature, setting this ruler apart from ordinary human leaders.<p><b>from the days of eternity</b><br>This emphasizes the eternal existence of the Messiah, aligning with the Christian belief in Jesus' divinity. It echoes the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called "Everlasting Father." The phrase underscores the belief that Jesus is not a created being but has existed eternally with God, reinforcing His divine authority and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem_ephrathah.htm">Bethlehem Ephrathah</a></b><br>A small town in Judah, significant as the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah.

Beth-lehem Ephratah: the two names, modern and ancient, are united, each of them having reference to the fertility of the country. In the Gospel the scribes quote, evidently from memory, the passage from Micah, in reply to Herod's question; and their first variation is in the title of the town--"Thou, Beth-lehem (not Ephratah, but), land of Judah." So also the people protested against Jesus on the ground of His being from Galilee, for, "Hath not the Scripture said that Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?" (<a href="/john/7-42.htm" title="Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?">John 7:42</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Though thou be little.</span>--Strictly, <span class= "ital">art little</span> among the thousands, or chiliads: a word analogous to our "hundreds;" a division of the tribes. In St. Matthew the word is paraphrased by princes, as representing the chiliads.<p><span class= "bld">Yet out of thee.</span>--St. Matthew--"for out of thee," the illative conjunction--helps to show that the quotation is really a paraphrase, conveying the ultimate intention of the prophet's words, which contrasts the smallness of the chiliad with the greatness of its destiny.<p><span class= "bld">Whose goings forth have been from of old.</span>--The nativity of the governor of Israel is evidently contrasted with an eternal nativity, the depth of which mystery passes the comprehension of human intellect: it must be spiritually discerned. The Creed of the Church expresses the article of faith as "Begotten of His Father before all worlds." He came forth unto Me to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been of old, from everlasting, from the days of antiquity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - At the time of Zion's deepest distress, and when her earthly king is suffering the grossest degradation, reduced as it were to the shepherd house at Bethlehem, a Deliverer shall arise thence who shall do wonderful things.

Probably the reckoning was made of fighting men (see note on Zechariah 9:7; and comp. <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-21.htm">Joshua 22:21, 30</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>). Bethlehem, called in the text Bethlehem Ephratah for solemnity's sake, was a small place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>, <a href="/john/7-42.htm">John 7:42</a>), of such slight importance as not to be named among the possessions of Judah in <a href="/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15</a>, or in the catalogue of <a href="/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yet out of thee shall he</span> (<span class="accented">one</span>) <span class="cmt_word">come forth unto me that is to be Ruler in Israel.</span> In spite of its insignificance, this birthplace of David shall be the birthplace of Messiah. "Shall some forth" is spoken sometimes of birth and descent, as in <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and Genesis 35:11; at other times it contains merely the notion of proceeding from, as in <a href="/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. In the present ease both ideas are suitable. <span class="accented">Unto me</span> (Jehovah is speaking). To my praise and glory, to do my will. Micah by these words would recall the announcement concerning David made to Samuel, "I have provided me a king" (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>), and thus show the typical relation of David to the Messiah (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting</span>. The meaning of the word rendered "goings forth" (<span class="accented">motsaoth</span>) is somewhat doubtful. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">egressus</span>. The Fathers see in it a declaration of the eternal generation of the Son: he who was born in time at Bethlehem hath an eternal existence. In this case the plural form of the word is a plural of majesty, or an abstract expression (comp. <a href="/psalms/114-2.htm">Psalm 114:2</a>, "dominions;" <a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>. "habitations"). To Christians, who believe in the mystery of the Holy Trinity, the plural would express the continual generation or the Son from the Father from everlasting and to everlasting, never beginning and never ending; as the Council of Lateran says, "Without beginning ever and without end, the Father begetting, the Sen being born (<span class="accented">nascens</span>), and the Holy Ghost proceeding." Many commentators take the "goings forth" to be the ancient promises, the revelations of the Angel of the covenant to the patriarchs, the various preparations made in type and history for the appearance of the great Son of David in due time; but this is a forced interpretation of the word. Granted that Micah's contemporaries understood the prophecy to state merely that a Saviour should arise from the lineage of David who traced his descent from hoar antiquity, and might be said to have lived in the days of old, this fact (if it be a fact) does not preclude us, with our more perfect knowledge, from seeing a deeper meaning in the inspired utterance, an adumbration of the nature of that Prince whom Isaiah calls "Everlasting" (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), the Word who "was in the beginning with God" (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 2</a>). We may note certain contrasts in these two first verses. Zion, "the daughter of troops," is contrasted with the mean and insignificant Bethlehem; yet the former shall be shamefully handled, the latter highly honoured; that one's king shall be dethroned and disgraced, this one's Ruler is from everlasting and to everlasting. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
