Balak's counsel was driven by fear of Israel's growing power as they approached the Promised Land. This historical context highlights the opposition Israel faced and God's protection over them. Balak's actions represent the worldly attempts to thwart God's plans, which ultimately fail.<p><b>and what Balaam son of Beor answered.</b><br>Balaam, though initially hired to curse Israel, was compelled by God to bless them instead. His response underscores God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will. Balaam's prophecies, particularly in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, are seen as messianic, foretelling a ruler from Israel who would triumph over enemies. This typology points to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to bless His people.<p><b>Remember your journey from Shittim to Gilgal,</b><br>This journey marks the transition from the wilderness wanderings to entering the Promised Land, as recorded in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3-4</a>. Shittim was the Israelites' last encampment before crossing the Jordan River, while Gilgal was their first camp in Canaan. This movement symbolizes a shift from a period of testing to one of fulfillment and victory. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in leading His people to their inheritance.<p><b>so that you may acknowledge the righteousness of the LORD.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The call to acknowledge God's righteousness emphasizes His just and faithful nature. Throughout Israel's history, God demonstrated His righteousness by fulfilling His promises, protecting His people, and executing justice. This acknowledgment is not merely intellectual but calls for a response of worship and obedience. The righteousness of the LORD is ultimately revealed in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's justice and mercy, offering salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak,_king_of_moab.htm">Balak, King of Moab</a></b><br>Balak was the king who sought to curse Israel through the prophet Balaam, fearing their numbers and strength as they approached his territory (Numbers 22-24).<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam,_son_of_beor.htm">Balaam, Son of Beor</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet hired by Balak to curse Israel.

Balaam was constrained to bless when he had the highest conceivable motive to curse the Israelites. He apologised for this involuntary action on his part to Balak. There is no more conclusive instance extant of the will of man controlled to do the exact opposite of his intended action in the history of mankind. It is better to put a stop after "answered him." The next sentence records an independent instance of the interposition of God in behalf of Israel. "Remember also the incidents which happened from Shittim to Gilgal." Shittim was the name of a valley in the plains of Moab (<a href="/joel/3-18.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.">Joel 3:18</a>), from which place Joshua sent two spies to view Jericho immediately before the passage of the Jordan to Gilgal was effected, under the circumstances mentioned in the fourth chapter of Joshua.<p><span class= "bld">Righteousness.</span>--The word rather means here <span class= "ital">liberality, beneficence.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The Lord reminds the people of another great benefit subsequent to the Exodus, viz. the defeat of the designs of Balak, and the sorceries of Balaam. <span class="cmt_word">Consulted</span>.
