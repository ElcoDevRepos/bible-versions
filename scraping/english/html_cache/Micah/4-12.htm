In the biblical context, the nations surrounding Israel often acted in ways that seemed wise to them but were ultimately futile against God's sovereign plans. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are higher than those of humans. It serves as a reminder of the limitations of human wisdom and the need for reliance on divine revelation.<p><b>or understand His plan</b><br>The inability to comprehend God's plan underscores the mystery of divine providence. Historically, the nations around Israel, such as Assyria and Babylon, believed they were acting on their own accord, but they were instruments in God's larger redemptive history. This aligns with <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-34</a>, which speaks of the depth of God's wisdom and knowledge. The plan of God often involves unexpected means and outcomes, ultimately pointing to the fulfillment of His purposes in Christ.<p><b>for He has gathered them</b><br>This gathering can be seen as a divine orchestration of events, where God brings nations together for His purposes. In the prophetic literature, God often gathers nations for judgment or to fulfill His covenant promises to Israel. This gathering is reminiscent of the eschatological gathering in <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, where God assembles nations for judgment in the Valley of Jehoshaphat. It reflects God's control over history and His ability to use even the actions of nations to accomplish His will.<p><b>like sheaves to the threshing floor</b><br>The imagery of sheaves and the threshing floor is rich with agricultural symbolism, common in the ancient Near East. The threshing floor was a place where grain was separated from chaff, symbolizing judgment and purification. This metaphor suggests that the nations, like sheaves, will be brought to a place of judgment where God will separate the righteous from the wicked. This imagery is also found in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>, where John the Baptist speaks of Jesus gathering His wheat into the barn and burning the chaff with unquenchable fire, pointing to the final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's sovereignty and omniscience.

He alone sees every angle, every motive, every end.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or understand His plan</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Plan&#8221; here is deliberate; God is not reacting, He is orchestrating. Joseph told his brothers in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a> that what they meant for evil, &#8220;God intended for good.&#8221; The same principle stands in Micah&#8217;s day.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27-28</a> the early church declares that even the conspiracy against Jesus happened &#8220;to do what Your hand and plan had predestined.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan in Micah includes both judgment and restoration. <a href="/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2-3</a> parallels this: the nations gather against Jerusalem, yet the LORD fights for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for He has gathered them like sheaves to the threshing floor</b><p>&#8226; The harvest image flips the scene. What looks like Israel trapped is actually the nations bundled for judgment. <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a> says Babylon will be &#8220;threshed,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> depicts Israel as God&#8217;s threshing sledge.<p>&#8226; Threshing separates grain from chaff&#8212;echoed by John the Baptist in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>: Christ will &#8220;gather His wheat&#8230; but burn up the chaff.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14-20</a> the sickle imagery climaxes God&#8217;s final harvest. Micah hints at that day, assuring the faithful that evil never gets the last word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a> pulls back the curtain: worldly powers plot, but they are ignorant of God&#8217;s higher purpose. His sovereign plan gathers those same powers for judgment, just as a farmer bundles sheaves for threshing. For God&#8217;s people, the verse shifts fear to confidence&#8212;reminding us that every headline, every threat, ultimately serves the Lord&#8217;s redemptive agenda.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/micah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They know not the thoughts of the Lord.</span>--As a commentary upon this passage, we may compare the message of God with reference to the haughty thoughts of Sennacherib. Then the Lord declared that the Assyrian king was but His instrument in all he had done; so that when he presumed to arrogate to himself the glory of his victories, the Lord revoked his commission: "I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou carnest." And so it came to pass.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/micah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - But the enemies who came to exult over Zion do not know God's design while blindly working it out. God's people are not to be destroyed, but their adversaries. <span class="cmt_word">They know not the thoughts of the Lord.</span> The heathen, who were the instruments of God's wrath against his people, knew nothing of his purpose in thus afflicting them, nor perceived that they themselves were drawn together for punishment. <span class="cmt_word">He shall gather</span> (<span class="accented">hath gathered</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>them as the sheaves into the floor.</span> Their blindness is proved by their not perceiving till too late that God has brought them together before Jerusalem, as sheaves are brought into the threshing floor, in order to be broken up and destroyed (comp. <a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>). The metaphor is carried on in the next verse. Various are the explanations of the prophet's reference in this prophecy. Many commentators see in it a reference to the destruction of the army of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>); others discern a defeat of the Scythians after the return from captivity; others, again, place it in the times of the Maccabees; and others interpret it of the defeat of the mystical adversaries of God's Church adumbrated in <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a>; and <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20</a>. But the prophet has not one definite event in view, but looks forward to the general conflict between the powers of the world and the Church, of which the historical events and material enemies were the types. Certain historical circumstances may exactly suit the prediction, but they do not exhaust it. And indeed we do wrong to seek for minute and definite fulfilment of particular predictions. Such utterances are often conditional and are modified by subsequent circumstances. The prophets are concerned with great moral truths and the righteous government of the world, and are not always to be interpreted with literal exactness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
