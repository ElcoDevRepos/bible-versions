Proverbs in biblical times were often used as a form of wisdom literature, conveying moral lessons or truths. Here, it suggests a public acknowledgment of Israel's downfall, serving as a warning to others. The use of "proverb" implies a widespread recognition of the consequences of Israel's actions, similar to how proverbs are universally understood truths.<p><b>and taunt you with this bitter lamentation:</b><br>The lamentation is described as "bitter," indicating deep sorrow and regret. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, lamentations were often public displays of mourning, sometimes accompanied by wailing and the tearing of garments. This taunt is not just a mockery but a reflection of genuine grief over the loss and devastation experienced by the people. It echoes the lamentations found in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Lamentations, where the destruction of Jerusalem is mourned.<p><b>&#8216;We are utterly ruined!</b><br>This exclamation captures the totality of the devastation. The Hebrew word used here can imply being broken or destroyed beyond repair. It reflects the complete loss of stability and prosperity, a theme common in the prophetic literature where the consequences of turning away from God are depicted as total ruin.<p><b>He has changed the portion of my people.</b><br>The "portion" refers to the land inheritance given to the tribes of Israel, a significant aspect of their identity and covenant with God. The changing of this portion signifies a divine reallocation, often seen as a punishment for disobedience. This echoes the warnings in Deuteronomy about the consequences of breaking the covenant, where the land would be taken away if the people turned to idolatry.<p><b>How He has removed it from me!</b><br>This personal lament highlights the individual impact of the collective judgment. The removal of land is not just a physical loss but a spiritual and cultural one, as the land was tied to the promises made to Abraham and his descendants. It underscores the personal nature of God's judgment, affecting each person and family.<p><b>He has allotted our fields to traitors.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The "traitors" likely refer to foreign invaders or those within Israel who have betrayed their own people, possibly by aligning with foreign powers or adopting their practices. This allocation of fields to outsiders is a reversal of the divine promise, where the land was meant to be a perpetual inheritance for the Israelites. It serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of unfaithfulness to God, as seen in the history of Israel's interactions with surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah delivered messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel_and_judah.htm">The People of Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The primary audience of Micah's prophecy, who were facing impending judgment due to their sins and injustices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_traitors.htm">The Traitors</a></b><br>Those who would take possession of the land that was once allotted to the people of Israel, symbolizing the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_judgment.htm">The Day of Judgment</a></b><br>A future time when God's judgment would manifest, leading to lamentation and loss for the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>A significant element in the covenant between God and Israel, representing God's promise and blessing to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_injustice.htm">The Consequences of Injustice</a></b><br>God's judgment is a response to the social injustices and sins of His people.

To &#8220;change&#8221; them is drastic, paralleling <a href="/psalms/78-59.htm">Psalm 78:59&#8211;61</a> where the LORD &#8220;abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh&#8221; when His people proved faithless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;How He has removed it from me!&#8221;</b><p>The shock emphasizes personal loss: the very land that defined identity is gone. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63&#8211;64</a> warned that disobedience would bring removal from the land, and <a href="/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a> records its fulfillment for the northern kingdom. Micah now extends that warning southward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He has allotted our fields to traitors.&#8221;</b><p>The dispossession is complete: covenant outsiders receive what was Israel&#8217;s. Assyria would seize fields (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>), and later Babylon would too (<a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>). The word &#8220;traitors&#8221; points to foreign conquerors and to local collaborators, echoing <a href="/1_samuel/23-11.htm">1 Samuel 23:11&#8211;12</a> where the Ziphites betray David for personal gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a> foretells a moment when those who seized land through oppression will themselves be mocked, lamenting their total ruin.

The enemy shall use the words in which Israel laments her calamity as a taunt against her (<a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And lament with a doleful lamentation.</span> The Hebrew gives a remarkable alliteration, <span class="accented">Nahah nehi niheyah</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Lament a lamentation with melody;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cantabitur canticum cum suavitate</span>; "Wail a wail of woe." (Pusey). The Syriac coincides with the LXX. By taking the three words as cognates, we get a very forcible sentence; but most modern commentators consider <span class="accented">niheyah</span> not a feminine formation, butniph. of the substantive verb <span class="accented">hayah</span>; hence the words would mean, "Lament with the lamentation;" "It is done," they shall say; "we are utterly spoiled." Thus Cheyne. The lamentation begins with "It is done," and continues to the end of the verse. The verbs are used impersonally - "one shall take up," "one shall lament," "one shall say;" but it is plain that the last two refer to the Jews who shall utter the given dirge, which in turn shall be repeated as a taunt by the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">We are utterly spoiled.</span> According to the second of the explanations of the preceding clause, these words expand and define the despairing cry, "It is done!" In the other case, they are the commencement of the lamentation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "We are miserably miserable." The complaint is twofold. First, the once flourishing condition of Israel is changed to ruin and desolation. Secondly, <span class="cmt_word">He hath changed</span> (<span class="accented">changeth</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the portion of my people.</span> This is the second calamity: he, Jehovah, passes our inheritance over to the hands of others; the land of Canaan, pledged to us, is transferred to our enemies. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, "hath been measured with a line." <span class="cmt_word">How hath he removed it</span> [the portion] <span class="cmt_word">from me!</span> This is better than the alternative rendering, "How doth he depart from me?" Turning away he hath divided our fields; rather, <span class="accented">to an apostate he</span> <span class="accented">divideth our fields.</span> The apostate is the King of Assyria or Chaldea; and he is so named as being a rebel against Jehovah, whom he might have known by the light of natural religion (comp. <a href="/micah/5-15.htm">Micah 5:15</a>; <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). This was fulfilled later by the colonization of Samaria by a mixed population. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/micah/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
