In the context of Micah's prophecy, the city likely refers to Jerusalem, the center of religious and political life in Judah. The wealthy, who were expected to be leaders and examples of righteousness, are instead characterized by violence. This reflects a broader biblical theme where wealth often leads to moral decay when not aligned with God's principles (e.g., <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>). The violence here can be understood as both physical and systemic, including exploitation and oppression of the poor, which is condemned throughout the prophetic books (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>, <a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>).<p><b>and its residents speak lies</b><br>The prevalence of deceit among the city's inhabitants indicates a breakdown of trust and integrity. Lying is consistently condemned in Scripture as contrary to God's nature (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). In a society where truth is compromised, justice becomes impossible, leading to further societal decay. This aligns with the prophetic critique of Israel's leaders and people, who have turned away from God's covenant and embraced falsehood (<a href="/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3-6</a>).<p><b>their tongues are deceitful in their mouths</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the pervasive nature of deceit, suggesting that dishonesty has become second nature to the people. The imagery of the tongue is significant in biblical literature, often representing the power of words to harm or heal (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>, <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-8</a>). The deceitful tongue is a metaphor for the moral and spiritual corruption that has infiltrated the community. This condition is symptomatic of a deeper spiritual malaise, where the people have forsaken God's truth for personal gain, echoing the warnings found in other prophetic writings (<a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was a contemporary of Isaiah and Hosea.
