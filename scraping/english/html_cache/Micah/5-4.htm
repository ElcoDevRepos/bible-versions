The imagery of a shepherd is deeply rooted in biblical tradition, symbolizing guidance, protection, and provision. In ancient Israel, shepherds were responsible for the safety and well-being of their sheep, often risking their lives for the flock. This metaphor is frequently used in the Bible to describe leaders, particularly kings and prophets, who are expected to care for their people. The reference to "He" is often interpreted as a messianic prophecy, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is described as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>. This connection emphasizes His role in leading and caring for His followers.<p><b>in the strength of the LORD</b><br>The strength mentioned here signifies divine empowerment. Leaders in the Bible often relied on God's strength rather than their own. This phrase underscores the idea that the shepherd's ability to lead and protect comes not from human power but from the divine. This is consistent with the biblical theme that true strength and success come from reliance on God, as seen in passages like <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, which states, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," says the LORD Almighty.<p><b>in the majestic name of the LORD His God</b><br>The name of the LORD represents His character, authority, and presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name was more than just an identifier; it conveyed the essence and reputation of the person. The use of "majestic" highlights the glory and honor associated with God's name. This phrase suggests that the shepherd's authority and legitimacy are derived from his relationship with God. It also reflects the biblical principle that actions done in God's name carry His power and blessing, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, "The name of the LORD is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe."<p><b>And they will dwell securely</b><br>Security and peace are central themes in biblical prophecy concerning the messianic age. This phrase promises safety and stability for the people under the shepherd's care. In the historical context, Israel often faced threats from surrounding nations, and the promise of security would have been particularly comforting. This assurance of safety is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>, which speaks of God's people living in peaceful dwelling places, secure homes, and undisturbed places of rest.<p><b>for then His greatness will extend to the ends of the earth</b><br>This phrase speaks to the universal scope of the shepherd's reign. The extension of greatness to the ends of the earth suggests a global impact, aligning with the biblical vision of God's kingdom encompassing all nations. This is consistent with the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that all peoples on earth will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. It also foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His followers to make disciples of all nations, indicating the worldwide reach of His message and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherd.htm">The Shepherd</a></b><br>This refers to the prophesied Messiah, who will lead and care for His people with divine authority and strength.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Symbolizes the people of God, who are under the care and protection of the Shepherd.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ends_of_the_earth.htm">The Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>Represents the universal scope of the Messiah's reign and influence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered this message, providing hope and assurance to the people of Israel during a time of turmoil.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_strength_of_the_shepherd.htm">The Strength of the Shepherd</a></b><br>The Messiah leads with divine strength, reminding us to rely on God's power rather than our own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_christ.htm">Security in Christ</a></b><br>Just as the flock dwells securely, believers find true security in their relationship with Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_his_name.htm">The Majesty of His Name</a></b><br>The name of the LORD is majestic, calling us to live in reverence and awe of His holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/global_mission.htm">Global Mission</a></b><br>The extension of His greatness to the ends of the earth challenges us to participate in the global mission of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_prophecy.htm">Hope in Prophecy</a></b><br>The fulfillment of prophecy in Christ assures us of God's faithfulness and the certainty of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Micah_5_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Micah 5:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Micah_5_4_Messiah_s_leadership_traits.htm">How does Micah 5:4 describe the leadership qualities of the Messiah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Christ_s_role_today_as_shepherd.htm">What does "He will stand and shepherd" reveal about Christ's role today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Micah_5_4_to_Jesus_as_Shepherd.htm">How does Micah 5:4 connect to Jesus' description as the Good Shepherd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_peace_in_Christ_s_greatness.htm">How can we find peace in Christ's "greatness to the ends of the earth"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_mirror_Christ_s_shepherding.htm">In what ways can we emulate Christ's shepherding in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_Messiah_as_shepherd_in_Micah_5_4.htm">How does Micah 5:4 describe the role of the Messiah as a shepherd?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_He_will_shepherd_Micah_5_4.htm">What is the significance of "He will stand and shepherd" in Micah 5:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Micah_5_4_s_link_to_Jesus_Bethlehem_birth.htm">How does Micah 5:4 relate to the prophecy of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_micah_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Micah 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_did_the_magi_observe_in_the_east.htm">What does 'One Shepherd and One Flock' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_good_conscience.htm">What are the key themes of the Minor Prophets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_heavy_shepherding.htm">What is heavy shepherding?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/meaning_of_'one_shepherd,_one_flock'.htm">What does "One Shepherd and One Flock" mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Micah 5:4 Mean</div><b>He will stand</b><p>The promised Ruler isn&#8217;t passive; He rises, takes His position, and remains present with His people.
