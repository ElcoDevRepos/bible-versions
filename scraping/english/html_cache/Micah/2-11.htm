In biblical terms, wind often symbolizes emptiness or vanity (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>). This imagery is used to describe false prophets who lack the Spirit of God and whose messages are devoid of truth and substance. The context of Micah is a time when true prophets like Micah and Isaiah were often opposed by false prophets who spoke what the people wanted to hear rather than the truth of God.<p><b>and say falsely,</b><br>The act of speaking falsely is a direct violation of the commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). In the prophetic context, false prophets were those who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages that contradicted His will. This was a significant issue in Israel, as false prophets often led the people astray, promoting idolatry and injustice (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,&#8221;</b><br>Wine and strong drink symbolize indulgence and excess, often associated with moral and spiritual laxity. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, wine was a common part of daily life, but excessive consumption was frowned upon (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The false prophet's message of wine and strong drink represents a promise of prosperity and pleasure without accountability, appealing to the desires of the flesh rather than the spirit. This stands in contrast to the true prophetic message, which calls for repentance and righteousness.<p><b>he would be just the preacher for this people!</b><br>This phrase highlights the people's desire to hear messages that align with their own desires rather than the truth of God. It reflects a society that prefers comfort and affirmation over conviction and correction. This is reminiscent of Paul's warning to Timothy about people who will gather teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>). The people's preference for such a preacher indicates a spiritual decline and a rejection of God's true prophets, like Micah, who called for justice and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Micah was from Moresheth in Judah.
