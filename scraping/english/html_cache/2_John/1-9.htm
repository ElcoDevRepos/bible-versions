In the early church, false teachers often introduced new doctrines that deviated from the apostolic teachings. The phrase "runs ahead" suggests a departure from the established truth, similar to the warnings in <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> about turning to a different gospel. The teaching of Christ refers to the core doctrines delivered by Jesus and His apostles, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the original message. This reflects the cultural context of the time, where Gnosticism and other heresies were emerging, challenging the early church's beliefs.<p><b>does not have God</b><br>This part underscores the seriousness of deviating from Christ's teachings. In the Johannine context, having God is synonymous with having a relationship with Him, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/2-23.htm">John 2:23</a>, which states that denying the Son means not having the Father. The phrase implies that true fellowship with God is contingent upon remaining faithful to the teachings of Christ. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that obedience and adherence to God's word are essential for a genuine relationship with Him, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<p><b>Whoever remains in His teaching</b><br>Remaining in His teaching implies a steadfast commitment to the doctrines and instructions given by Jesus. This echoes <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-7</a>, where Jesus speaks about abiding in Him as a branch abides in the vine. The concept of remaining or abiding is central to Johannine theology, emphasizing a continuous, active relationship with Christ. Historically, this was crucial for the early church as it faced external pressures and internal divisions, necessitating a firm grounding in apostolic teaching.<p><b>has both the Father and the Son</b><br>This phrase highlights the unity and relationship between the Father and the Son, a central tenet of Christian doctrine. It affirms that accepting and adhering to the teachings of Christ ensures a relationship with both the Father and the Son, as seen in <a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>, where Jesus promises that those who love Him and keep His word will be loved by the Father, and both will make their home with them. This reflects the Trinitarian understanding of God, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one, a mystery that is foundational to Christian belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of this epistle, John was one of Jesus' closest disciples and is traditionally understood to be the "beloved disciple."

John is describing teachers or listeners who sprint ahead of the apostolic track, adding ideas, practices, or revelations that Christ never gave. Scripture warns against this kind of detour:<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> shows how quickly the Galatians deserted to &#8220;a different gospel.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-4</a> speaks of those who &#8220;advance a different doctrine&#8221; and end up &#8220;puffed up with conceit.&#8221;<p>Running ahead looks energetic, even visionary, yet it immediately places someone outside the safe boundaries God has set in His Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>without remaining in the teaching of Christ</b><p>The key word is &#8220;remaining.&#8221; Jesus used the very same idea in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, &#8220;Remain in Me, and I will remain in you.&#8221; Abiding means staying put in what we have heard from the beginning (<a href="/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24</a>). It is not passive; it is a daily choice to let the words of Christ shape our thinking, worship, morality, and relationships. When people chase new trends or so-called deeper truths that contradict Scripture, they are no longer remaining.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>does not have God</b><p>John&#8217;s verdict is sobering. To leave the doctrine of Christ is to lose fellowship with God Himself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a> warns that the branch that does not remain in the vine &#8220;is thrown away and withers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11-12</a> teaches that life is found only &#8220;in His Son.&#8221;<p>Departure from Christ&#8217;s teaching is not a minor misstep; it severs the life-giving connection with the Father.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever remains in His teaching</b><p>Stability is possible.
