Traditionally, this is understood to be the Apostle John, who was one of the original twelve disciples of Jesus. By the time this letter was written, John was likely advanced in age, which would further justify the use of the term. The role of an elder in the early church was to provide spiritual oversight and guidance, similar to the role of a pastor or bishop today. This title emphasizes John's authority and experience in the faith.<p><b>To the chosen lady and her children</b><br>The "chosen lady" is a subject of debate among scholars. Some interpret this as a metaphorical reference to a local church, with "her children" being the members of that congregation. Others believe it refers to an actual woman and her family. The term "chosen" indicates that she is part of the elect, those whom God has called to salvation. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereign choice, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>. The use of familial language underscores the close-knit nature of early Christian communities.<p><b>whom I love in the truth</b><br>The phrase "in the truth" signifies a love that is grounded in the shared belief in Jesus Christ and His teachings. This is not merely an emotional affection but a deep, spiritual connection based on the truth of the Gospel. The concept of truth is central to John's writings, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life." This love is consistent with the commandment to love one another, as found in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>.<p><b>and not I alone, but also all who know the truth</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal aspect of the Christian faith. The love and fellowship extend beyond personal relationships to include all believers who share in the truth of the Gospel. This reflects the unity of the body of Christ, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-13</a>. The phrase "all who know the truth" suggests a shared understanding and acceptance of the core doctrines of Christianity, which bind believers together across different communities and cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elder.htm">The Elder</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be the Apostle John, who is writing this letter.

Like Peter, who identified himself as &#8220;a fellow elder&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1</a>), John speaks as a shepherd caring for the flock. The term also echoes <a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17&#8211;28</a>, where elders guard doctrine and nurture believers. In <a href="/3_john/1-1.htm">3 John 1:1</a> he uses the same designation, reinforcing continuity in leadership and reminding readers that mature oversight is God&#8217;s design for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To the chosen lady and her children</b><p>The greeting moves from the sender to the recipients: a woman singled out as &#8220;chosen,&#8221; along with her children. Scripture frequently celebrates God&#8217;s electing love&#8212;&#8220;He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). Whether John writes to an individual or to a congregation personified as a &#8220;lady,&#8221; the point is clear:<p>&#8226; They belong to God by His sovereign grace (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their identity shapes their conduct, just as Paul urges believers to &#8220;walk in a manner worthy of the calling&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p>Children here likely includes both her biological family and the spiritual children under her influence, echoing the pattern of Lois and Eunice cultivating Timothy&#8217;s faith (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom I love in the truth</b><p>John&#8217;s affection is anchored &#8220;in the truth,&#8221; not in sentiment alone.

By stating this, John signals that everything he will ask of them flows from shared commitment to the gospel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and not I alone</b><p>John widens the circle: his care is not isolated. The family of God is always bigger than any one voice. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a> calls us to &#8220;spur one another on toward love and good deeds&#8230;encouraging one another&#8221;.

Paul calls the church &#8220;the pillar and foundation of the truth&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). John earlier wrote, &#8220;We are from God; whoever knows God listens to us&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-6.htm">1 John 4:6</a>).

Her sister's children are in the same place as the writer. The two mothers are both honoured with the religious title "elect." The writer (we assume from the introduction that he is the Apostle John) loves the family with true Christian love. All who are in the way of truth have the same feelings for them, for the truth is a bond of union between all such. He wishes them grace, mercy, and peace from the Father and the Son, in all their thoughts and all their affections (<a href="/context/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1-3</a>).<p>(1 a.)

Other apostles had been called elders; their successors also were called elders; but St. John was "the elder." That there was a second John at Ephesus, who was known as "the elder," to distinguish him from the apostle and evangelist, is a theory of Eusebius, based upon a doubtful interpretation of an awkwardly worded passage in Papias. But it is by no means certain that any such person ever existed. Irenaeus, who had read Papias, and been intimate with Polycarp, the disciple of St. John, seems to know nothing of any such person. Even if he existed, there is little reason for attributing this Epistle to him; it is too like the First Epistle to be by a different author. Unto the elect lady. This rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> should be retained: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="accented">cannot be a</span> proper name, on account of verse 13; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> need not be one. We commit ourselves to nothing that is disputable if we render <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "lady;" whereas if we render it "Kyria" it is open to any one to object that perhaps the lady's name was not Kyria, and that perhaps she is not an individual at all, but a Church. She is elect, as being chosen out of the dominion of the evil one (<a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>) into the Christian family. She is thus reminded at the outset of the relationship between them; she is a member of that elect company of believers of which he is the elder. It is futile to ask who this lady is. There have been various conjectures, some of them absurd; but we know no more than the letter itself tells us. Evidently the lady and her children were not among the great ones of the earth; they have made no name in the world. And herein lies one of the chief lessons of the Epistle. Those mentioned in it were ordinary people, such as any Church in any generation might produce. But because they were faithful, and endeavoured to live up to their calling, the apostle loved them, and all true Christians loved them, and he dared to assure them that "grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father" should be their portion. Any Christian minister may give the same assurance to faithful Christians, however humble and inconspicuous, still. They may win no place in the history of the world that is passing away; but they have a place in the heart of him who abideth for ever. Note the characteristic repetition of the characteristic word "truth," which occurs five times in the first four verses. All words respecting truth and bearing witness to it are characteristic of St. John. In two of the five cases "truth" has the article; "all they that know <span class="accented">the</span> truth; for <span class="accented">the</span> truth's sake which abideth in us." It is not impossible that "the truth" here means him who is the Way, the Truth and the Life. Christ is the Revelation of Divine truth to man. All who know him love all faithful Christians for his sake. To the apostle truth was not a mere notion, "or a set of notions, however large and accurate; it was no theory about God, but God himself, and God manifest in the flesh in order that we might know him and partake his life." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_john/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
