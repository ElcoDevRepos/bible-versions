This joy reflects the pastoral heart of John, who is often referred to as the "Apostle of Love." The term "children" is likely a metaphor for the members of the church, indicating a familial relationship within the body of Christ. The phrase "walking in the truth" suggests a lifestyle consistent with the teachings of Jesus, emphasizing both belief and practice. This aligns with John's emphasis on truth throughout his writings, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life." The joy John experiences is similar to that of a shepherd who finds his sheep following the right path, echoing the sentiments found in 3 <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>.<p><b>just as the Father has commanded us</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the command to walk in truth, linking it directly to the will of God the Father. The commandment to live in truth is not a new concept but is rooted in the teachings of the Old Testament, where adherence to God's commandments is a sign of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1-9</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates the importance of obedience to God's commands as a demonstration of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The reference to the Father highlights the Trinitarian nature of Christian doctrine, where the commands of God are fulfilled through the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. This obedience is not burdensome but is a reflection of the believer's relationship with God, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-3.htm">John 5:3</a>. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the continuity between the Old and New Covenants, where the moral and ethical teachings of the law are fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of this letter, traditionally understood to be John the Apostle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples.

Having congratulated her about this, he states the chief thing which he desires of her: the pure Christian love which implies every other grace and virtue; in other words, walking after the divine commandments. That this love should be pure, that these commandments should be unimpaired, it was necessary to remember that nothing new could be added to the original message of Christ. This warning was timely, because many errors had already appeared, especially that greatest error which denied the Incarnation. The family must, therefore, be on its guard, lest it should be cheated of its reward. The test was very simple: any advance beyond the doctrine of Christ. It would be better for the family not to entertain in their house any who had committed themselves to these doctrines of development (<a href="/context/2_john/1-4.htm" title="I rejoiced greatly that I found of your children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.">2John 1:4-11</a>).<p>(2 <span class= "ital">a.</span>) (4) <span class= "bld">I rejoiced . . .</span>--Comp. <a href="/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1Corinthians 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Philippians 1:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rejoice greatly that I have found (certain) of thy children walking in truth.</span> The Revised Version is certainly right in rendering <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f55;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> "I <span class="accented">have</span> found" rather than "I found;" and it is probably right in rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> "I rejoice" rather than "I rejoiced."
