The term "deceivers" refers to those who spread false doctrines, particularly Gnosticism, which denied the true humanity of Christ. The phrase "gone out into the world" suggests that these false teachers were actively spreading their beliefs beyond the local church, indicating a widespread issue. This echoes Jesus' warnings in <a href="/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a> about false prophets arising and leading many astray.<p><b>refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh</b><br>This phrase addresses a specific heresy that denied the incarnation of Christ. The denial of Jesus coming "in the flesh" was a direct challenge to the doctrine of the Incarnation, which is central to Christian faith. This aligns with the apostle John's emphasis on the reality of Jesus' humanity, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us." The refusal to confess this truth was a significant theological error that threatened the foundation of Christian belief.<p><b>Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist</b><br>Here, the text identifies those who deny Christ's incarnation as both "the deceiver" and "the antichrist." The term "antichrist" is used to describe anyone who opposes or seeks to replace Christ, not just a singular end-times figure. This is consistent with 1 <a href="/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18</a>, which speaks of many antichrists already present in the world. The use of "deceiver" and "antichrist" underscores the seriousness of this false teaching and its potential to lead believers astray. Theologically, this serves as a warning to remain vigilant against teachings that undermine the core truths of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of this epistle, John was one of Jesus' closest disciples and a key figure in the early church.

Paul echoed the same concern in <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29&#8211;30</a>, noting that wolves would arise both outside and inside the church. This phrase underscores:<p>&#8226;Deception is widespread, not isolated.<p>&#8226;The threat comes from those who present themselves as spiritual leaders.<p>&#8226;Believers must stay watchful, just as <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> urges vigilance against the adversary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh</b><p>The core test of orthodoxy centers on affirming the incarnation. &#8220;The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). To deny this truth is to reject the heart of the gospel:<p>&#8226;Jesus&#8217; full humanity&#8212;He truly entered time, space, and history (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226;Jesus&#8217; full deity&#8212;only God in the flesh can atone for sin (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226;Salvation&#8217;s reliability&#8212;if Christ did not literally come in the flesh, the cross and resurrection lose their meaning (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).<p>John had previously written, &#8220;Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>), tying a right Christology to genuine faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Any such person is the deceiver</b><p>John does not soften his language.

While Scripture speaks of a future, singular Antichrist (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3&#8211;4</a>), anyone denying Christ&#8217;s incarnation shares that same hostile spirit. Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226;Error about Christ is not neutral; it is anti-Christ.<p>&#8226;Standing against antichrist teaching means holding fast to &#8220;the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints&#8221; (Jude 3).<p>&#8226;The ultimate victory is certain, for &#8220;greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a> warns believers that numerous false teachers already spread doctrines denying the literal incarnation of Jesus Christ.

The dangers which they suggest are not imaginary. Mischief has already been done by neglecting them. "Deceiver" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here means "seducer," one who causes others to go astray. The cognate verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> is frequent in St. John, especially in the Revelation (<a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3, 8, 10</a>), and commonly indicates seduction into grave error (comp. <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). The true reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> gives "are gone forth," not "are entered" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. We cannot be sure that "are gone forth" refers to their leaving the true Church; although <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a> inclines us to think so: it may mean no more than that they have gone abroad spreading their erroneous tenets. Just as "love not" in <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10, 14, 15</a> and 1 John 4:20 is equivalent to "hate," so "confess not" here is equivalent to "deny." These seducers deny "Jesus Christ <span class="accented">as coming</span> in the flesh," or (as the Greek may possibly mean) they deny "Jesus <span class="accented">as Christ coming</span> in the flesh." The present participle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> seems to indicate exactly the position of some of the Gnostic teachers. The Jew denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">had</span> taken place - the Messiah had not yet come. The Gnostic denied that the Incarnation <span class="accented">could</span> take place: no such Person as the Christ coming in the flesh was possible; that the Infinite should become finite, that the Divine Word should become flesh, was inconceivable. The teacher who brings such doctrine as this "is <span class="accented">the</span> deceiver and <span class="accented">the</span> antichrist" about whom the elder's children had been so frequently warned. In the strong language which St. John here and elsewhere (<a href="/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22, 26</a>; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>) uses respecting those who deny or pervert the truth, we hear the voice of the "son of thunder," ever jealous about whatever touched the honour of his Lord. Such hatred of error was the outcome of a firm grasp, and profound love, of the truth. It is easy to imitate and to exceed such strength of language; but let us beware of doing so without having first attained to an equal comprehension of the truth, and an equal affection for it. The strong words of the apostle are the expression of a glowing conviction. Our strong words are too often the expression of a heated temper; and a man who loses his temper in argument cares more about himself than about the truth. Let us remember the noble words of St. Augustine to the heretics of his own day: "Let those rage against you who know not with what toil truth is found, and how difficult it is to avoid errors; who know not with how much difficulty the eye of the inner man is made whole; who know not with what sighs and groans it is made possible, in however small a degree, to comprehend God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_john/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">many</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(polloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4183.htm">Strong's 4183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many; often. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">deceivers</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#955;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(planoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4108.htm">Strong's 4108: </a> </span><span class="str2">Roving, i.e. an impostor or misleader.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have gone out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ex&#275;lthon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1831.htm">Strong's 1831: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go out, come out.
