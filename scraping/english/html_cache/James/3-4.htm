The imagery of ships would have been familiar to James's audience, many of whom lived in coastal areas or were involved in trade. This metaphor serves to illustrate the power of small things to influence larger entities, a theme consistent with the broader message of <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3</a> about the tongue's power.<p><b>Although they are so large</b><br>Ships in the first century could be quite large, especially those used for trade or military purposes. The size of these ships would have been impressive to the original audience, emphasizing the contrast between the ship's size and the smallness of the rudder. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the small and seemingly insignificant to accomplish great things, as seen in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17).<p><b>and are driven by strong winds,</b><br>The mention of strong winds highlights the challenges and forces that ships must navigate. In biblical literature, winds often symbolize trials or divine intervention, as seen in the calming of the storm by Jesus (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that despite external pressures, control can still be maintained through something small and seemingly insignificant.<p><b>they are steered by a very small rudder</b><br>The rudder, though small, has the power to direct the entire ship. This is a direct analogy to the tongue, which, though small, can have a significant impact on one's life and the lives of others. The rudder's role is crucial, much like the tongue's role in guiding one's actions and words, reflecting the biblical principle that what comes out of the mouth reflects the heart (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18</a>).<p><b>wherever the pilot is inclined.</b><br>The pilot represents the person in control, making decisions about the ship's direction. This can be seen as a metaphor for personal responsibility and the importance of self-control, a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The pilot's inclination reflects the heart's intentions, aligning with the biblical teaching that one's words and actions are a reflection of their inner spiritual state.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus.
