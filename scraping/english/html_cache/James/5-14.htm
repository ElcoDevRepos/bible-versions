In the early church, sickness was often seen as a trial or a test of faith. The question implies a communal responsibility towards those who are suffering. In biblical times, illness could be both physical and spiritual, and the community was encouraged to support one another in these trials. The question also reflects the understanding that sickness is a part of the human condition, a result of the fall of man as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>He should call the elders of the church</b><br>The elders, or presbyters, were leaders within the early Christian communities, responsible for teaching, governance, and pastoral care. Their role in this context highlights the importance of spiritual authority and communal support. The practice of calling the elders suggests a structured church community, where leaders are recognized and respected. This reflects the early church's organization as seen in <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a> and <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>, where elders were appointed to oversee the church.<p><b>to pray over him</b><br>Prayer is a central practice in Christianity, seen as a means of communicating with God and invoking His power. The act of praying over the sick emphasizes intercessory prayer, where the community, through its leaders, seeks divine intervention for healing. This reflects the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to heal, as seen in other scriptural instances like <a href="/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a> and <a href="/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>. The communal aspect of prayer underscores the unity and faith of the church body.<p><b>and anoint him with oil</b><br>Anointing with oil has historical and cultural significance, often associated with consecration and healing. In biblical times, oil was used for medicinal purposes, as well as a symbol of the Holy Spirit's presence and power. The act of anointing signifies setting apart the sick person for God's special attention and care. This practice is rooted in Old Testament traditions, such as the anointing of kings and priests (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), and is seen as a type of Christ, the Anointed One.<p><b>in the name of the Lord</b><br>This phrase signifies the authority and power of Jesus Christ invoked in the act of healing. Doing something in the name of the Lord implies acting according to His will and under His authority. It reflects the belief that all healing ultimately comes from God and that the church acts as His instrument. This is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who performed miracles and healings in His Father's name, as seen in <a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>. The invocation of the Lord's name also emphasizes faith in His power and presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Elders&#8212;also called overseers or shepherds&#8212;are charged to &#8220;watch over the flock&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>) and to &#8220;keep watch over your souls&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling them shows humility and submission to God-given authority (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; It weaves pastoral care and accountability into the healing process.<p>&#8226; The church is portrayed as a family where burdens are shared (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to pray over him</b><p>The primary ministry elders offer is earnest intercession. &#8220;The prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>), echoing Jesus&#8217; promise that &#8220;whatever you ask in My name, I will do&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Prayer declares dependence on God, not on human remedies (<a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Corporate prayer unites hearts; Peter&#8217;s chains fell off while &#8220;the church was praying earnestly to God for him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Prayer positions the sufferer under the Lord&#8217;s care, whether He heals immediately, gradually, or sustains through trial (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and anoint him with oil</b><p>Oil was both a common medicine and a sacred symbol.

The verse calls us to communal, obedient, Christ-centered ministry so that God&#8217;s compassion can be displayed and His people strengthened&#8212;whether through physical recovery or sustaining grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The elders of the church</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>literally, <span class= "ital">the presbyters.</span> The identity of "bishop" (<span class= "ital">episcopus</span>) and "presbyter" in the language of the apostolic age seems conclusive. Such is the opinion of Lightfoot (<span class= "ital">Epistle to the Philippians, </span>93-97; see also his <span class= "ital">Dissertation on the Christian Ministry, ibid., </span>180-267), and few may hope to gainsay it. In fact, the organisation of the early Church was much more elastic than theologians always suppose; and names and terms were applied less rigidly than the schoolmen of the Middle Ages have so stoutly declared. But, on the other hand, no man who has read the <span class= "ital">Patres Apostolici</span> can deny the reality of Church government as enforced by them, nor base on their authority any defence of Congregationalism or the rule of a mere presbytery. The theory of development must be maintained, though not on the lines of Dr. Newman.<p>(14, 15) <span class= "bld">Anointing him with oil</span>.--Or, <span class= "ital">unction.</span> The use of some precious and mysterious ointment, on solemn occasions, obtained in most of the ancient nations, specially the Eastern. The Jews themselves were by no means originators of the habit, although they carried it to its highest ceremonial and significance. Apart, too, from the regular performances of the rite, as upon the accession of a king, or the consecration of a high priest, it often occurred in private cases, and some striking instances are recorded in the Gospels:--the spikenard, costly and fragrant (<a href="/context/luke/7-36.htm" title="And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.">Luke 7:36-50</a>), wherewith the Saviour's feet were anointed by "a woman which was a sinner;" and that, again, which Mary, of her grateful love, poured upon Him six days before His death (<a href="/context/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3-9</a>). These were not unusual acts, but chiefly worthy of note because of the persons concerned. It was not remarkable for women to make such offerings to a famous rabbi, but that our Lord should be so treated, carried a deeper meaning. Nor, again, was it a new ordinance with which the Apostles were first commissioned, in pursuance whereof they "anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them" (<a href="/mark/6-13.htm" title="And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.">Mark 6:13</a>). "Here," observes Bishop Harold Browne, "unction was evidently an outward sign, similar to that used by our Saviour, when He made clay, and put it to the blind man's eyes. It was connected with the miraculous power of healing." This connection only, this use of a known form with a diviner import, was the cause of astonishment; and clearly it was to such a practice, with simply its common intention, that St. James refers. Nor can we refrain from saying, however undesirous of controversy, that all which unction now implies to the Romanist is quite opposed to whatever force and value are given it in Holy Writ. There unction is enjoined "with the special object of recovery;" its purport was a present bodily one, and in no way applicable to the future of the soul. "The prayer of faith shall save the sick"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shall <span class= "ital">heal</span> him: the faithful prayer shall be that which God will answer, and so "<span class= "ital">raise up</span>" the sufferer. But, it is urged, the next clause has a different force: "If he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him." Such is only apparent in our own version, and not in the original. The grammatical sense infers that the sick man is abiding under the consequence of some committed sin, which is "presumed to have been the working cause of his present sickness." So Alford, and Bede similarly: "Many by reason of sins done in the soul are compassed by weakness: nay, even death of the body." And the former theologian again: "Among all the daring perversions of Scripture, by which the Church of Rome has defended her superstitions, there is none more patent than that of the present passage. Not without reason has the Council of Trent defended its misinterpretation with anathema; for indeed it needed that, and every other recommendation, to support it, and give it any kind of acceptance. The Apostle is treating of a matter totally distinct from the occasion and the object of extreme unction. He is enforcing the efficacy of the prayer of faith in afflictions (<a href="/james/5-13.htm" title="Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.">James 5:13</a>). Of such efficacy he adduces one special instance. In sickness let the sick man inform the elders of the church. Let them, representing the congregation of the faithful, pray over the sick man, accompanying that prayer with the symbolic and sacramental act of anointing with oil in the name of our Lord. Then the prayer of faith shall save (<span class= "ital">heal</span>) the sick man, and the Lord shall bring him up out of his sickness; and even if it were occasioned by some sin, that sin shall be forgiven him. Such is <span class= "ital">the</span> simple and undeniable sense of the Apostle, arguing for the efficacy of prayer; and such the perversion of that sense by the Church of Rome." Not that we should think this and other like cases are wholly intentional twistings of God's word. The Latin Bible is in many places a faulty--though not deliberately unfaithful--rendering of the Hebrew and Greek; and half our differences with Rome arise from such misinterpretations. Allowing the beginning of mischief to have been oftentimes a wrong translation, religious opinions engendered from it, we can understand, would be hardly cast aside, more especially when advantageous to their possessors. Little by little the change of doctrine drew on, and most probably thus:--The aim of the apostolic anointing was bodily recovery, and (again we quote Bishop Browne) "this exactly corresponds with the miraculous cures of early ages; . . . so long as such . . . powers remained in the Church, it was reasonable that anointing of the sick should be retained." But these powers ceased, in the wisdom of God, after awhile; not so, however, the ceremony to which men's minds in distress had been accustomed. It was retained in affection when its true force had departed. But since no outward result remained visible, fervent and mystical teachers could not well avoid searching for the invisible; and thus the area of operations was removed from the flesh to the spirit. The words of Holy Scripture would, with a little straining, bear such a colourable translation: and so was laid the foundation of that belief now current in a great part of Christendom. The Greek Church still practices unction, but rather in memory of a venerated custom, wherein God's mercy was aforetime present; the Latin, unfortunately, is bound by its Council of Trent (<span class= "ital">Sessio</span> xiv.) to believe "extreme unction to be a sacrament, instituted by Christ, conferring good, remitting sins, and comforting the infirm." Its authorised manual of devotion--<span class= "ital">The Crown of Jesus</span> (p. 710)--says, "Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in His tender solicitude for those whom He has redeemed by His precious blood, has been pleased to institute another sacrament, to help us at that most important hour on which eternity depends--the hour of death. This sacrament is called Extreme Unction, or the last anointing." And further explains, "The priest, in administering this sacrament, anoints the five principal senses of the body--the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the lips, the hands and the feet--because these have been employed during life in offending God. At each anointing he pronounces these words: 'May the Lord by this holy anointing, and by His own most tender mercy, pardon thee whatever sin thou hast committed, by thy sight, hearing,' &c. . . ." Notwithstanding this lamentable departure from right exegesis, some divines think it wise and well to reflect how far with profit the ancient ceremony could be revived; while others would rather let it slumber with the past. "When miraculous powers ceased, it was reasonable that the unction should cease also." Still more reasonable is it that even the form or memorial, however touching and beautiful, should be abandoned, rather than we should seem by it to be at one with the changed--alas! the false--teaching of that Church of man's tradition, Rome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> <span class="accented">- Directions in ease of sickness.</span> Let him call for the elders of the Church.
