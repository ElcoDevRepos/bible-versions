The term "brothers" indicates a familial bond among believers, suggesting unity and mutual support. The "Lord's coming" refers to the anticipated return of Jesus Christ, a central tenet of Christian eschatology. This expectation of Christ's return is meant to inspire hope and perseverance. The early church lived with the imminent expectation of this event, which provided motivation for holy living and evangelism. Patience here is not passive but active, involving trust in God's timing and sovereignty.<p><b>See how the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the soil&#8212;</b><br>The imagery of a farmer is a common biblical metaphor, illustrating the principles of sowing and reaping, patience, and reliance on God's provision. In an agrarian society, the farmer's dependence on the land and weather was well understood. The "precious fruit" symbolizes the valuable outcome of patient labor and faith. This can be connected to the spiritual fruit that believers are to bear, as mentioned in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>. The farmer's work is a type of Christ's work in believers, cultivating spiritual growth and maturity.<p><b>how patient he is for the fall and spring rains.</b><br>The reference to "fall and spring rains" is significant in the agricultural cycle of the ancient Near East, particularly in Israel. The fall rains, or "early rains," typically began in October or November, softening the ground for planting. The spring rains, or "latter rains," occurred in March or April, crucial for the maturation of crops. This dependence on seasonal rains underscores the necessity of patience and trust in God's provision. The rains can also be seen as a metaphor for the Holy Spirit's work in the life of a believer, bringing growth and fruitfulness. The patience of the farmer serves as an example for believers to wait on God's timing for spiritual and eschatological fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Confidence in the Lord&#8217;s timing turns patience from passive waiting into active, hopeful perseverance (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Be patient.</span>--The third, and last, part of the Letter commences here with these exhortations towards endurance.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, because of this your deep and abiding misery, be sure God's help is nigh:--<p>"The darkest hour is on the verge of day."<p>"Out of your stony griefs" build, like Jacob of old, a house of God (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm" title="And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.">Genesis 28:19</a>), whereunto you may run and find refuge.

Be ye also patient</span>.--It becomes you, the just, to bear with the unjust till God work the end of your trial, and prove them at the same time. Again and again, through several verses (<a href="/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7-11</a>), St. James repeats his advice, emphasising it with various reasons: the nearness of deliverance; the Judge standing at the gate; the example of the prophets--persecuted by men, and therefore blessed of God; the hope of those who endure--Job for example: the very faithfulness and tender mercy of the Lord, bringing all things to a perfect end. Few ideas are more startling (is a reflection of Dr. Evans) than those produced by the strange combinations in Scripture. Matters are joined there which we mostly put asunder here, speaking of them, at least, as apart. And thus we read in the Revelation (<a href="/james/1-9.htm" title="Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:">James 1:9</a>) of the <span class= "ital">kingdom and patience</span> of Jesus Christ. But all Christians are citizens of a patient kingdom; the King thereof is more patient, as He hath greater need of patience than His subjects, and He is patient, because He is strong. Impatience is a sign of weakness. God can afford to wait, for His time is eternity. And we can be strong in His strength, and wait also in patience. In so far as St. James's hearers were earthly minded, they could not learn this lesson; so often with ourselves we would have our wrong righted instantly, and to the full. Only one view of life can alter this, viz., the lifting of our gaze from earth to heaven, remembering that "the time is short" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1Corinthians 7:29</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-20.</span> - CONCLUDING EXHORTATIONS <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> TO PATIENCE (vers. 7-11); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> AGAINST SWEARING (ver. 12); <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> TO PRACTICAL CONDUCT IN HEALTH AND IN SICKNESS (ver. 13, etc.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortation to patience.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be patient therefore</span>.
