It underscores humanity's dominion over animals as stated in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>, where God grants humans authority over all living creatures. The mention of "all kinds" emphasizes the vastness and variety of God's creation, which is also celebrated in <a href="/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>. This diversity is a testament to God's creativity and power.<p><b>are being tamed</b><br>The present tense "are being tamed" suggests an ongoing process, indicating that humanity continues to exercise control over nature. This aligns with the cultural mandate in Genesis, where humans are called to subdue the earth. Historically, taming animals has been crucial for agriculture, transportation, and companionship, reflecting humanity's ability to harness and manage the natural world. This process of taming is a demonstration of human ingenuity and adaptability.<p><b>and have been tamed by man</b><br>The past tense "have been tamed" acknowledges the historical success of humans in domesticating animals. This reflects the fulfillment of the divine mandate given in Genesis. The ability to tame animals is a unique characteristic of humans, setting them apart from other creatures. This phrase also serves as a metaphor for the potential control humans can exert, contrasting with the subsequent verses that discuss the difficulty of taming the tongue. The historical context of animal domestication, from ancient times to the present, illustrates humanity's enduring relationship with creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

From the very beginning, God granted mankind &#8220;dominion over the beasts of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>), a truth echoed in <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6-7</a>: &#8220;You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen&#8230;.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Examples of taming abound: horses bridled for work (<a href="/james/3-3.htm">James 3:3</a>), oxen yoked for plowing (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), even bears and lions trained for royal courts in ancient cultures.<p>&#8226; James uses this broad category to set up a striking contrast: if humans can master the fiercest land creatures, why is the human tongue still so unruly (<a href="/james/3-8.htm">James 3:8</a>)?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>birds</b><p>&#8226; Falcons respond to a handler&#8217;s glove, parrots mimic speech, and pigeons once carried messages&#8212;simple illustrations of God&#8217;s grant that &#8220;every winged bird&#8221; be subject to mankind&#8217;s stewardship (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/12-7.htm">Job 12:7-10</a> invites us to &#8220;ask the birds, and they will tell you&#8221; of God&#8217;s sovereign hand; Jesus pointed to the birds&#8217; dependence on the Father in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a> to teach trust. All these passages affirm that birds, though free-flying, can and do submit to human guidance&#8212;again underscoring James&#8217;s point about taming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>reptiles</b><p>&#8226; Think of snakes charmed by flute notes or turtles trained to navigate mazes. <a href="/acts/10-12.htm">Acts 10:12</a> refers to &#8220;all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds of the air,&#8221; recognizing their variety under human observation.<p>&#8226; Even the serpent, craftiest of creatures (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>), falls within the broader category that mankind has learned to handle. Yet James highlights that, impressive as this dominion is, mastery over our own speech remains elusive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>creatures of the sea</b><p>&#8226; Dolphins perform on cue, orcas respond to trainers, and massive nets haul in schools of fish (<a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4-7</a>). <a href="/psalms/8-8.htm">Psalm 8:8</a> specifically mentions &#8220;the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas&#8221; as placed beneath human authority.<p>&#8226; Humanity has explored, harvested, and even entertained itself with marine life&#8212;clear evidence that James&#8217;s statement is not hyperbole but observable fact.<p>&#8226; By including the hardest environment to conquer&#8212;the depths&#8212;James drives home that no realm of creation lies outside mankind&#8217;s taming ability&#8230;except the realm of the tongue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/3-7.htm">James 3:7</a> reminds us that the Creator entrusted humanity with genuine dominion over every kind of creature&#8212;land, air, reptile, and sea. History and Scripture alike confirm this stewardship. Yet the very next verse reveals the punchline: &#8220;but no man can tame the tongue&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-8.htm">James 3:8</a>). The verse therefore magnifies both the breadth of human capability and the stubborn power of sinful speech, urging believers to seek God&#8217;s help for the only creature we still struggle to master&#8212;our own words.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">For every kind of beasts . . .</span>--Compare the margin, and read more exactly, thus: <span class= "ital">Every nature of beasts and birds, and creeping things, and things of the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed, by the nature of man.</span> All kinds have been mastered by mankind, as promised at creation (<a href="/context/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26-28</a>).
