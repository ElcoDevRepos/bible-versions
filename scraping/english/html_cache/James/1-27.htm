The term "pure" suggests a religion that is free from corruption or hypocrisy, aligning with the biblical call for holiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>). "Undefiled" indicates a state of being untainted by sin or worldly influences, echoing the call for believers to be set apart (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). The reference to "our God and Father" highlights the personal relationship believers have with God, who is both sovereign and paternal, underscoring the familial bond within the Christian faith (<a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>).<p><b>to care for orphans and widows in their distress,</b><br>Caring for orphans and widows was a significant aspect of Jewish law and tradition, reflecting God's compassion and justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>). In the ancient world, orphans and widows were among the most vulnerable, often lacking social and economic support. The early church continued this practice, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>, where the apostles addressed the needs of widows. This care is a practical expression of love and faith, demonstrating the heart of God, who is described as a defender of the fatherless and widows (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p><b>and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</b><br>This phrase calls for personal holiness and separation from worldly values and practices that contradict God's standards. The "world" here refers to the system of values and beliefs that are opposed to God (1 <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>). The call to remain unpolluted is a reminder of the believer's identity as a new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>) and the ongoing process of sanctification (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>). This separation is not about physical withdrawal but maintaining spiritual integrity and moral purity in a fallen world, reflecting the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who was in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

In the early church, caring for them was a priority (<a href="/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1-6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>). James&#8217; wording highlights hands-on involvement &#8220;in their distress,&#8221; not distant sympathy.

No one word can express this obvious interpretation of the original, taken as it must be in completion of the verse before; and certainly "religion" in its ordinary sense will not convey the right idea. Real worship, we may say, pure and undefiled, beheld and acknowledged as such in the presence of God, even the Father--mark the tender pathos of His divine relationship--is this:<p><span class= "bld">To visit the fatherless </span>(or, <span class= "ital">orphans</span>) <span class= "bld">and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span>--Here is the double proof of the perfect life of holiness, the savour whereof is as perpetual incense before the throne of God. And the help afforded to the helpless, put thus in the first place of the two requirements, will often bring about the second--namely, that spotless condition of unworldliness which marks, and will ever mark, the true servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. Deeds of benevolence may be and are often done by those who are not His; but all who truly belong to Him must live a life which praises Him continually in good works; not, it is hardly needful to say, as a cause--but rather the natural and inevitable result of love for Him, warming the heart within.<p>Scrupulous indeed were the "religious" contemporaries of James; they would not enter where the image of Divus Caesar had its votive flame, while they were ceremonially clean for the keeping of their passover--"they went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled" (<a href="/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>). But He whom there they cruelly sought to slay had told them before, though in vain, "that which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man" (<a href="/mark/7-20.htm" title="And he said, That which comes out of the man, that defiles the man.">Mark 7:20</a>), and "nothing from without can defile him" (<a href="/james/1-15.htm" title="Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.">James 1:15</a>). What an eternal caution may be learned here against cold reliance upon ritual! What an instance, ever, under all varieties and forms, to be applied to themselves by the erring; persecuting, and deceitful sons of men! while, on the other hand, from these words of the wise Apostle we may be sure what is truest, nay, the only true service, acceptable and accepted, of the Most High--"To visit the fatherless and the widow," beholding in them a new image of Christ, the Man of Sorrows, is to show pity verily to Him; and at the last such "pure religion" will receive His own approval. "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm" title="And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.">Matthew 25:40</a>).
