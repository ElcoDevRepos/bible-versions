In the Jewish context of James's audience, being "religious" would involve adherence to the Law and participation in temple rituals. The term "religious" here implies outward expressions of faith, which can be seen in practices such as prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. This echoes Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>, where He warns against practicing righteousness before others to be seen by them.<p><b>and yet does not bridle his tongue</b><br>The imagery of "bridling" suggests control and restraint, akin to how a bridle is used to guide a horse. The tongue, representing speech, is a recurring theme in James, notably in <a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1-12</a>, where it is described as a small part of the body that can cause great harm. The cultural context of the time valued wisdom and speech, as seen in Proverbs, which frequently advises on the power of words. This phrase underscores the importance of self-control, a fruit of the Spirit mentioned in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p><b>he deceives his heart</b><br>Deception of the heart implies a self-delusion, where one's internal beliefs do not align with their external actions. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> speaks of the heart as deceitful, highlighting the need for divine guidance. This phrase warns against the danger of self-deception, where one might believe they are righteous while their actions suggest otherwise.<p><b>and his religion is worthless</b><br>The term "worthless" indicates something without value or effect. In the context of James's epistle, which emphasizes practical faith, this statement challenges the notion that mere outward religiosity is sufficient. This aligns with Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, where He criticizes their focus on external rituals while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness. The call here is for a faith that is genuine and transformative, reflecting the teachings of Christ, who emphasized the heart's condition over mere ritual compliance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

"If any man . . . seem"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to himself, and not to others merely; the warning is not to the hypocrite, but the self-deceived. A Christian may have, or rather cannot help having, the feeling that he is a religious man; and so far well. But if such a one deceive his own heart, as confessedly he may, and give to those around him the proof of his self-delusion in not curbing his tongue, vain and useless is all his religious service. Just as some mistakenly suppose there can be a religion of hearing without acting, so others rest satisfied "in outward acts of worship, or exactness of ritual." "But," remarks Bishop Moberly on this passage, and his voice may win an audience where another's would not, "if a man think himself a true worshipper because he conforms to outward services, while he lets his tongue loose in untruth or unkindness or other unseemliness, he deceives himself." The first mark of true religion is gentleness of tongue, just as the contrary, blasphemy, is the most damning fault of all. Our Lord directly says, "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned" (<a href="/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>). The text, however, is more a guide for self-examination than a stone to be cast at a neighbour; and "well is" it indeed for "him that hath not slipped with his tongue" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-8.htm" title="Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:">Ecclesiasticus 25:8</a>).<p>The Apostle returns to this subject, though from a different point of view, in James 3, which compare with the above. The best commentary on the whole is Bishop Butler's Sermon, No. IV., "Upon the Government of the Tongue."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); seems to himself rather than to others; translate, with R.V., <span class="accented">thinketh himself to be.</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si quis Putat se esse. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Religious</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>).

Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the word apparently only occurs here in the whole range of Greek literature) is the diligent performer of Divine offices, of the <span class="accented">outward</span> service of God, but not necessarily anything more. This depreciatory sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> well seen in a passage of Philo ('Quod Det. Pot. 'Jus.,' 7), where, after speaking of some who would fain be counted among the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> on the score of diverse washings or costly offerings to the temple, he proceeds: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> Trench on 'Synonyms,' from whom the reference is here taken). "How delicate and fine, then, St. James's choice of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>! 'If any man,' he would say, 'seem to himself to be <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a diligent observer of the offices of religion, if any man would render a pure and undefiled <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to God, let him know that this <span class="accented">consists</span>, not in outward lustrations or ceremonial observances; nay, that there is a better <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than thousands of rams and rivers of oil, namely, to do justly and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7, 8</a>); or, according to his own words, ' to visit the widows and orphans in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world'" (Trench on 'Synonyms,' p. 170: the whole passage will well repay study.
