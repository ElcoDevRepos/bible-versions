In biblical context, this echoes the Tenth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>), which warns against coveting. The desire for what others possess can lead to sin and disrupt community harmony. Historically, this reflects the socio-economic disparities in the early church, where some members might have been wealthier than others, leading to envy and strife.<p><b>you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it.</b><br>The language of "kill" may be metaphorical, emphasizing the extreme lengths to which people might go due to unchecked desires. This could also be a hyperbolic reference to the destructive nature of envy and strife, as seen in the story of Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>). The inability to obtain what is coveted underscores the futility of such desires, aligning with Ecclesiastes' theme of vanity and the fleeting nature of worldly pursuits.<p><b>You quarrel and fight.</b><br>This phrase points to the conflicts and divisions within the early Christian communities. The early church faced internal disputes, as seen in Paul's letters addressing divisions (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a>). Such quarrels can be traced back to selfish ambitions and desires, which James warns against. The call for unity and peace is a recurring theme in the New Testament, reflecting Jesus' teachings on peacemaking (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>You do not have, because you do not ask.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the importance of prayer and reliance on God. It suggests that unmet needs may result from a lack of prayerful dependence on God, rather than from striving through human effort. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a> about asking, seeking, and knocking. It underscores the necessity of approaching God with humility and faith, trusting in His provision rather than relying solely on human means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The word &#8220;crave&#8221; signals an appetite that refuses to be satisfied until it possesses what it wants.<p>- Scripture consistently warns against coveting&#8212;<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>&#8212;because unchecked desire dethrones God and centers life on &#8220;the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>).<p>- These cravings promise fulfillment yet deliver emptiness. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a> observes, &#8220;Whoever loves money is never satisfied with money,&#8221; underscoring that desire apart from God only intensifies hunger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it</b><p>- When desire is frustrated, it escalates. James uses the stark verb &#8220;kill&#8221; to show how far selfish ambition can go&#8212;whether literal violence like Cain murdering Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-8</a>) or murderous hatred of the heart that Jesus equates with homicide (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>).<p>- &#8220;Covet&#8221; points to yearning for what belongs to someone else, a pattern that fueled David&#8217;s sin with Bathsheba and Uriah (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>). Yet even after scheming, David still faced emptiness and judgment&#8212;the very &#8220;unable to obtain&#8221; James describes.<p>- The futility is intentional: God resists proud striving (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) so that people will recognize their need for Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You quarrel and fight</b><p>- Inner war produces outer war. Self-oriented hearts spill over into fractured relationships&#8212;families, churches, communities.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a> states, &#8220;Arrogance leads only to strife,&#8221; while <a href="/galatians/5-15.htm">Galatians 5:15</a> warns believers, &#8220;If you keep on biting and devouring one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.&#8221;<p>- The body of Christ is called instead to &#8220;do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). When that calling is ignored, conflict becomes inevitable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You do not have, because you do not ask</b><p>- After exposing the problem, James points to the neglected solution: prayer. Instead of coveting, believers are invited to bring needs to the Father.<p>- Jesus promises, &#8220;Ask, and it will be given to you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>). He repeats in <a href="/john/16-24.htm">John 16:24</a>, &#8220;Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.&#8221;<p>- James already highlighted this principle: &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). Failure to pray leaves genuine needs unmet, while misdirected cravings rage on.<p>- <a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a> assures that when we ask according to God&#8217;s will, He hears us. The doorway out of frustrated desire is humble, dependent, God-centered prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/4-2.htm">James 4:2</a> traces a clear progression: unsubmitted desire &#8594; frustrated coveting &#8594; destructive conflict &#8594; prayerless lack. The antidote is not harder grasping but humble asking. When hearts turn from self to God, cravings are purified, relationships heal, and true satisfaction is received as a gift rather than seized as a prize.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2, 3) <span class= "bld">Ye lust, and have not . . .</span>--Better thus: <span class= "ital">Ye desire, and have not; ye kill, and envy, and cannot obtain; ye fight and make war; ye have not, because ye ask not; ye ask and receive not, because ye ask that ye may spend it on your lusts.</span> It is interesting to notice the sharp crisp sentences, recollecting at the same time that St. James himself fell a victim to the passions he thus assails, probably at the hands of a zealot mob. The marginal note to the second of the above paragraphs gives <span class= "ital">envy</span> as an alternative reading for "kill": but this is an error. "Ye kill and play the zealot" would be still nearer the original: for, as with Jedburgh justice in the old Border wars, hanging preceded the trial, so with these factions in Jerusalem death went first, almost before the desire to deal it. Lust, envy, strife, and murder:--like the tale of human passion in all ages, the dreadful end draws on. It is written in every national epic; its elements abound in the life of each individual: the slaughter in Etzel's halls overshadows the first lines of the Nibelungen-lied; the curse of Medea hangs like a gathering cloud around Jason and his Argonauts. Is it objected (<a href="/james/4-3.htm" title="You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your lusts.">James 4:3</a>) that prayer is made but not answered? The reply is obvious; <span class= "ital">Ye ask not</span> in the true sense; when ye do ask ye receive not, because God is too loving, even in His anger. Nevertheless, remember, He gave the Israelites "their desire, and sent leanness withal into their soul" (<a href="/psalms/106-15.htm" title="And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.">Psalm 106:15</a>). "I," said He by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/14-4.htm" title="Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols;">Ezekiel 14:4</a>), "will answer him that cometh to Me, according to his idols." What greater curse could fall than an eternity of avarice to the miser, of pollution to the sensual, of murder to the violent? Many a man of quiet Christian life will thank God by-and-by, when he knows even as he is known (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>), that not a few of his prayers were unanswered, or at least that they were not granted in the way which he had desired. Safety is only to be found in our Lord's own manner of petition, "Not my will, but Thine be done" (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm" title="Saying, Father, if you be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.">Luke 22:42</a>). Alas! in shameful contrast to this we read of many an evil-hearted prayer offered up to the Lord our Righteousness; invocations of saints for help in unholy deeds; of angels, for acts rather befitting devils of the pit; and can hardly have the conscience to reproach the heathen for supplicating their gods in no worse a manner for no better cause.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You crave</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(epithymeite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1937.htm">Strong's 1937: </a> </span><span class="str2">To long for, covet, lust after, set the heart upon.
