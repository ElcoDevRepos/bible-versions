The early church faced persecution, and James writes to believers who are experiencing trials (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). Suffering can include physical, emotional, or spiritual distress. The Greek word for suffering here implies enduring hardship. Throughout Scripture, suffering is seen as a means of spiritual growth and reliance on God (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>). The Bible consistently encourages believers to turn to God in times of trouble, as seen in the Psalms, where David often cries out to God in his distress (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p><b>He should pray.</b><br>Prayer is presented as the appropriate response to suffering. It is a direct line of communication with God, allowing believers to seek His comfort, guidance, and intervention. The act of praying in times of trouble is a demonstration of faith and dependence on God. Jesus Himself modeled prayer during His suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-44</a>). The early church was devoted to prayer, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, and it is a central practice for believers to maintain a close relationship with God.<p><b>Is anyone cheerful?</b><br>This phrase acknowledges that life is not only filled with suffering but also with moments of joy and contentment. The term "cheerful" suggests a state of well-being and happiness. In the context of the early church, believers experienced joy despite persecution, as their hope was rooted in Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is often linked to the assurance of salvation and the presence of God in one's life.<p><b>He should sing praises.</b><br>Singing praises is the natural response to a cheerful heart. It is an expression of gratitude and worship towards God. The Psalms are filled with songs of praise, reflecting the importance of music in worship (<a href="/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95:1-2</a>). In the New Testament, Paul and Silas sang hymns to God while imprisoned, demonstrating that praise can transcend circumstances (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>). Singing praises not only glorifies God but also edifies the believer and the community of faith, as it reinforces the truths of God's character and works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Prayer and praise keep hearts aligned with the unchanging Lord who hears, helps, and deserves all glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) We now pass on to advice of different kinds--to the heavy-laden or light-hearted, to the suffering and afflicted. Prayer is to be the refuge of one, praise the safeguard of another; the whole life is to revolve, as it were, around the throne of God, whether in the night of grief or day of joy.<p><span class= "bld">Let him pray.</span>--No worthier comment can be found than Montgomery's hymn--<p>"Prayer is the burden of a sigh,<p>The falling of a tear,<p>The upward glancing of an eye,<p>When none but God is near."<p>Long petitions, or many, cannot be always made; mind and body may be too weak and ill; but ejaculations--"Arrows of the Lord's deliverance," as Augustine called them, "shot out with a sudden quickness"--these are ever in the power of the beleaguered Christian. And--<p>"More things are wrought by prayer<p>Than this world dreams of."<p><span class= "bld">Let him sing</span>.--The word originally applied to instrumental music, the Eastern accompaniment of "psalms." Praise, like prayer, ought to be individual as well as congregational. Hymns might be used by all in their devotions, and could not fail to be a blessing; while for those who have God's great gift of music, it were surely better to sing--as the Apostle urges--than to say. There is a sadness latent in the most jubilant of earthly tunes, but not so with the heavenly; and quiring angels do not scorn to catch our humblest notes, and weave them in their endless song, if they be raised in thankfulness to Him Whom they and all creation praise.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-20.</span> <span class="accented">- Exhortations with respect to practical conduct in health and sickness.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Is any among you suffering? let him pray. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Is any cheerful? let him sing praise. <p>Prayer in the narrower sense of <span class="accented">petition</span> is rather for sufferers, who need to have their wants supplied and their sorrows removed.
