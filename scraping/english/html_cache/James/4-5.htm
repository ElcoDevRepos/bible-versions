It implies that the teachings of Scripture are intentional and meaningful. The rhetorical question suggests that the audience may have been neglecting or misunderstanding the weight of biblical teachings. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><b>that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us</b><br>This refers to the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in believers, a concept rooted in the New Testament. The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a seal and guarantee of their inheritance (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>). The indwelling Spirit is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>, where God promises to put His Spirit within His people. This indwelling signifies a new covenant relationship with God, where His laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>yearns with envy?</b><br>The phrase suggests a deep, intense desire of the Spirit for the devotion and faithfulness of believers. This yearning can be understood in the context of God's jealousy for His people, a theme present throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). God's jealousy is not like human envy but is a righteous desire for His people to remain faithful to Him, avoiding idolatry and spiritual adultery. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, akin to a marriage, where God desires exclusive devotion (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

To imagine otherwise questions the Author&#8217;s wisdom.<p>&#8226; James likely alludes to the many passages describing God&#8217;s jealousy for His people&#8212;e.g., &#8220;For the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning rings true for every age: ignoring Scripture&#8217;s plain meaning opens the door to spiritual adultery (<a href="/psalms/119-9.htm">Psalm 119:9&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us&#8230;</b><p>&#8226; At conversion God places His Spirit within believers (<a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This indwelling is personal and permanent&#8212;&#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Spirit Himself authored Scripture (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>), He now applies it from the inside, refusing to coexist with divided loyalties.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;yearns with envy?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Yearns&#8221; pictures intense longing; &#8220;with envy&#8221; points to God&#8217;s holy jealousy.

It must, however, be noted that a slightly varied punctuation of the verse will give quite another sense to its questioning. (See Wordsworth.) <span class= "ital">Suppose ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the Spirit, which took up His abode in you, lust to envy?</span> And defensible or not as this translation may be, at least it escapes some of the difficulties of the foregoing.

The first clause is rendered, "<span class="accented">Or</span> think ye that the Scripture speaketh in vain?" but as an alternative there is suggested in the margin, "Or think ye that the Scripture saith in vain?" as if the following clause were a quotation from Scripture. And of this following clause three possible renderings are suggested. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">In the text</span>: "Doth the Spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying?

With regard to the first clause, the rendering of the R.V., "speaketh," may be justified by <a href="/hebrews/9-5.htm">Hebrews 9:5</a>.
