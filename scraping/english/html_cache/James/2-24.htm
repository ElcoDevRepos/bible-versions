In the context of <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2</a>, he has been discussing the relationship between faith and works, using examples like Abraham and Rahab to illustrate his point. The phrase suggests that the evidence is clear and observable, emphasizing the practical nature of faith in action.<p><b>a man is justified</b><br>The term "justified" here refers to being declared righteous in the sight of God. In the Jewish context, justification was often associated with adherence to the Law. However, James is addressing a Christian audience, emphasizing that true justification involves more than just verbal profession of faith. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of bearing fruit as evidence of genuine faith (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>).<p><b>by his deeds</b><br>Deeds, or works, are actions that demonstrate the authenticity of one's faith. James is not contradicting Paul's teaching on justification by faith (<a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>) but is complementing it by showing that genuine faith naturally results in good works. This reflects the holistic view of faith in the early church, where belief and action were inseparable. The deeds mentioned are not just ritualistic observances but acts of love and mercy, as seen in the examples of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac and Rahab's protection of the spies.<p><b>and not by faith alone</b><br>This phrase underscores the argument that faith, if it is genuine, cannot exist in isolation from works. The historical context of James' letter suggests he was addressing a misunderstanding or misuse of Paul's teachings, where some believed that mere intellectual assent was sufficient for salvation. James clarifies that true faith is living and active, echoing the teachings of Jesus in the parable of the sheep and the goats (<a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>), where actions are the evidence of one's relationship with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

He invites the reader to &#8220;see&#8221; the evidence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>: &#8220;Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>: &#8220;Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.&#8221;<p>The invitation is to observe, not speculate. Authentic faith leaves visible footprints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a man is justified</b><p>Justification is being declared righteous in God&#8217;s sight, and Scripture presents two complementary angles:<p>&#8226; Godward declaration by faith (<a href="/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Outward vindication before others by works (<a href="/james/2-22.htm">James 2:22</a>).<p><a href="/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a> notes Abraham was &#8220;justified by works&#8221; in the sense of demonstration, while verse 3 reminds us it was still &#8220;credited to him as righteousness.&#8221; James emphasizes the same event&#8217;s public dimension.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by his deeds</b><p>Works are not self&#8208;earned merit but the inevitable fruit of genuine faith.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>: &#8220;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>: &#8220;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>: Believers should &#8220;be devoted to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for the people.&#8221;<p>When God plants saving faith, productive deeds spring up naturally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and not</b><p>James contrasts true faith with empty profession.

James agrees that salvation starts and stands on faith; his concern is a faith that stays alone&#8212;unaccompanied by obedient love.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a> guards against boasting in works; verse 10 immediately calls us to walk in them.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> shows that anyone &#8220;in Christ&#8221; becomes &#8220;a new creation,&#8221; and new creations act differently.<p>Thus, faith saves, but the faith that saves never remains solitary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/2-24.htm">James 2:24</a> teaches that genuine, saving faith always produces tangible obedience. God counts a person righteous the moment he believes, yet that righteousness is proven and displayed through Spirit&#8208;empowered deeds. James and Paul harmonize: we are saved by faith alone, but the faith that saves is never alone&#8212;it grows hands and feet that serve, love, and obey.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Ye see then how that by works . . .</span>--Observe that St. James says a man is not justified "by faith <span class= "ital">only," </span>putting the adverb in the last and most emphatic position.
