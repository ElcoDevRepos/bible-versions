The term "condemned" suggests a legal judgment, possibly indicating that the rich were using their influence to manipulate the justice system against the poor. In the historical context of the early church, the wealthy often had the power to sway legal decisions, leading to the oppression and even death of the innocent. The word "murdered" is strong, implying not just physical death but also the destruction of livelihoods and well-being. This echoes the prophetic denunciations found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>, where leaders are condemned for crushing the people and grinding the faces of the poor. The "righteous" here refers to those who are innocent and just, possibly believers who are suffering unjustly. This aligns with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>, where Jesus blesses those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake.<p><b>who did not resist you</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the non-retaliatory response of the righteous. In the cultural context of the time, the oppressed often had little means to resist their oppressors, especially if they were poor. This non-resistance can be seen as a reflection of Jesus' own teachings in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, where He instructs to turn the other cheek. It also mirrors the example of Christ Himself, who, when reviled, did not revile in return (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). The phrase suggests a call to patient endurance and trust in God's justice, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are encouraged to leave vengeance to the Lord. This non-resistance is not a sign of weakness but a demonstration of faith and reliance on God's ultimate justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus.

Such a reference, however, has been disallowed by some commentators, as conveying too harsh an accusation against the whole Jewish people<span class= "ital">;</span> and besides, it being unfair to forget that St. James was writing to Christian Jews, as well as to the anti-Christian. But, in a manner, all wrong and oppression tend towards the murder of the Just One, as every falsehood (see Note on <a href="/james/3-13.htm" title="Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.">James 3:13</a>) is an attack on the Truth. And far beyond this, in the present case our Lord is rightly to be considered the victim of the Jews. His blood is on them and on their children (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm" title="Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.">Matthew 27:25</a>); they filled up "the measure of their fathers" (<a href="/matthew/23-32.htm" title="Fill you up then the measure of your fathers.">Matthew 23:32</a>), that "the blood of all the righteous" might come upon them, from Abel to Zacharias (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>): the one crowning sin made them guilty of all. And not only is this backward participation true, but there is a forward one as well. Christ Himself was persecuted by Saul in the afflictions of His servants (<a href="/context/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4-5</a>), and so onward ever till the martyr-roll be full. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The <span class="accented">climax of their sin. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one.</span> Does this allude to the death of our Lord? At first sight it may well seem so. Compare St. Peter's words in <a href="/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>, "Ye denied the Holy One and the Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" St. Stephen's in <a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>, "the coming of the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" and St. Paul's in <a href="/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a>, "to see the Just One (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." But this view is dispelled when we remember how throughout this whole passage the ideas and expressions are borrowed from the Old Testament, and when we find that in <a href="/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a> (LXX.) the wicked are represented as saying, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> passage which lies at the root of the remarkable section in Wisd. 2, "Let us oppress the poor righteous man .... Let us condemn him with a shameful death." It is probable, then, that passages such as these were in St. James's mind, and suggested the words, and thus that there is no direct allusion to the Crucifixion (which, indeed, could scarcely be laid to the charge of his readers), but that the singular <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used to denote the class collectively (cf. <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>). It is a remarkable coincidence, pointed out by most commentators, that he who wrote these verses, himself styled <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the Jews, suffered death at their hands a very few years afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">He doth not resist you.</span> According to the view commonly adopted, St. James simply means to say that the righteous man suffered this evil at their hands without resistance. Another interpretation seems more possible, taking the clause as interrogative, "Does he not resist you?" the subject, implied but not expressed, being God; as if he would say, "Is not God against you?
