Faith is a central theme throughout the Bible, often described as trust and confidence in God and His promises. <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a> states that without faith, it is impossible to please God, highlighting its importance. In the context of James, faith is not merely intellectual assent but involves a deep trust in God's character and His willingness to provide wisdom generously (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The call to ask in faith reflects the biblical principle that God responds to those who earnestly seek Him with a sincere heart (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>without doubting</b><br>Doubt, in this context, refers to a divided mind or wavering between two opinions. The Greek word used here, "diakrinomenos," suggests an internal conflict or hesitation. This echoes the story of Peter walking on water in <a href="/matthew/14-29.htm">Matthew 14:29-31</a>, where his doubt caused him to sink. Doubt can hinder one's relationship with God, as it reflects a lack of trust in His power and promises. The call to ask without doubting encourages believers to have a steadfast and unwavering faith, fully trusting in God's ability to answer prayer.<p><b>because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea</b><br>This simile paints a vivid picture of instability and restlessness. The sea, often used in Scripture to symbolize chaos and unpredictability (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>), serves as an apt metaphor for a doubter's mind. Just as waves are subject to external forces and lack a firm foundation, so too is the person who doubts. This imagery underscores the importance of having a firm and anchored faith, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, where believers are encouraged not to be tossed by every wind of doctrine.<p><b>blown and tossed by the wind</b><br>The imagery of being blown and tossed by the wind further illustrates the lack of stability and direction in a doubter's life. In ancient times, the sea was a place of uncertainty and danger, and sailors relied heavily on the wind for navigation. A person who doubts is compared to a ship without a rudder, at the mercy of external forces. This highlights the need for a strong, unwavering faith that provides direction and purpose, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages trust in the Lord for guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

Asking is required, but effective asking must be wrapped in unwavering faith. Doubt fractures that faith, producing instability likened to a restless sea driven by changing winds. The remedy is simple and profound: anchor every request in the character of the faithful God, approach Him with single-hearted trust, and expect His wise and generous response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.</span>--Surely this verse alone would redeem the Apostle from the charge of slighting the claims of faith. It is here put in the very forefront of necessity; without it all prayer is useless. And mark the addition--<p><span class= "bld">Nothing wavering.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">doubting nothing</span>: reechoing the words of our Saviour to the wondering disciples, as they gazed at the withered fig-tree on the road to Bethany (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>). This "doubting" is the halting between belief and unbelief, with inclination towards the latter. But it may be asked by some one, whence and how is an unhesitating faith to be gained? And the reply to this will solve all similar questions: faith, in its first sense, is the direct gift of God; but it must be tended and used with love and zeal, or its precious faculties will soon be gone. In the hour of some besetting thought of unbelief "the shield of faith" will "quench all the fiery darts of the wicked" (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm" title="Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.">Ephesians 6:16</a>), but that shield must be lifted up, as it were, in an act of faith. "There is no God--at least, to care for me," may be the hopeless cry, responsive to a cruel wound of the enemy. Let the battle-hymn of the Christian make quick answer, "I believe in God;" and often, with that very effort, the assault will cease for awhile. Further, let us take comfort in the thought that intellectual is not moral doubt: the unorthodox are not as the adulterous. Nevertheless, intellectual doubt may spring from an evil habit of carping criticism and self-opinion, for the foundation of which, in so far as a man himself has been either the wilful or the careless cause, he must bear the curse of its results.<p><span class= "bld">For he that wavereth</span> (or, <span class= "ital">douhteth</span>) <span class= "bld">is like a</span> <span class= "bld">wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</span>--<span class= "ital">Doubteth</span> is preferable to "wavereth"; there is no play on the Greek words, as in the English text--"wavereth" and "wave."

And who can describe the terror, even of the faithful, in those hours of darkness when the face of the Lord is hidden; when, as with the disciples of old, the ship is in the midst of the sea, tossed with the bitter waves. Nevertheless, the raging wind will clear the heavens soon from clouds, and by the radiance of the peaceful moon we too may behold our Helper near--the Lord Jesus walking on the sea--and if He come into the ship the storm must cease.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The A.V.
