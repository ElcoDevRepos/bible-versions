In the context of the Jewish tradition, the Lawgiver is understood to be God, who gave the Law to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 20). The term "Judge" reflects God's role in determining righteousness and justice, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the book of Judges where God raises leaders to deliver Israel. This phrase underscores the monotheistic belief central to Christianity and Judaism, affirming that ultimate authority rests with God alone. It also connects to <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>, which states, "For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; it is he who will save us."<p><b>the One who is able to save and destroy</b><br>This highlights God's omnipotence and His control over life and death. The ability to save and destroy is a divine prerogative, reflecting God's power over eternal destinies. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of this power in <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>, where He warns to fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. This phrase also points to the dual aspects of God's nature: His mercy and His justice. Salvation is offered through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's saving grace, while destruction is reserved for those who reject Him, as seen in the final judgment described in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<p><b>But who are you to judge your neighbor?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the reader's presumption to judge others, reminding them of their own limitations and fallibility. It echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7:1-5</a>, where He warns against judging others hypocritically. The cultural context of James' audience involved divisions and conflicts within the early Christian communities, often stemming from judgmental attitudes. This phrase calls for humility and self-reflection, urging believers to leave judgment to God. It also aligns with the broader biblical theme of loving one's neighbor, as commanded in <a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

We do not create standards; we receive them.<p>&#8226; This reality steadies the believer&#8217;s heart: moral absolutes do not shift with culture or personal feeling (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the One who is able to save and destroy</b><p>&#8220;the One who is able to save and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-12.htm">James 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power is comprehensive. <a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a> reminds us, &#8220;Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.

As a king is the fountain of honour, so the ultimate source of law is God; and all judgment really is delegated by Him, just as ordinary courts represent the royal majesty: to usurp such functions is to provoke the offended sovereign--whether of earth or heaven. "It is not our part," said Bengel, "to judge, since we cannot carry out our sentence." (Comp. a parallel scripture, <a href="/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls.
