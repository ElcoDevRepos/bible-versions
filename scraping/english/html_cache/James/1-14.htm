In <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, the serpent tempts Eve, illustrating the beginning of humanity's struggle with temptation. The Greek word for "tempted" here implies a testing or proving, which can lead to sin if not resisted. This aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>, which assures believers that God provides a way to endure temptation.<p><b>when by his own evil desires</b><br>The phrase emphasizes personal responsibility in the face of temptation. Unlike external forces, it is the internal "evil desires" that lead to sin. This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful. The term "evil desires" can be linked to the concept of the flesh in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, where Paul lists the works of the flesh, contrasting them with the fruit of the Spirit.<p><b>he is lured away</b><br>The imagery here is akin to a fish being drawn away from safety by bait. This metaphor highlights the deceptive nature of temptation, which often appears attractive but leads to danger. <a href="/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a> provides a vivid illustration of this process, describing a young man being led astray by an adulteress, symbolizing the seductive power of sin.<p><b>and enticed</b><br>The word "enticed" suggests being caught or trapped, similar to a hunter capturing prey. This reflects the cunning nature of sin, which entices individuals through their desires. <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a> continues this thought, showing the progression from desire to sin and ultimately to death. This progression is a warning to remain vigilant and rely on God's strength to resist temptation, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, which describes the armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

When those desires are unchecked, they lure us step by step until we are trapped. By acknowledging personal responsibility, fleeing the bait, and relying on God&#8217;s promised escape, we can resist temptation and walk in the freedom Christ purchased for us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) So far the inspired Apostle has spoken of the outward part of temptation; now he lays bare the inner--for we suffer the two-fold evil. From without come the whispers of Satan, by himself or his legionaries, skilled in all that may entice and delude the unwary soul. And if the doctrine be true that to every one a guardian angel is appointed, so also would seem to be the opposite idea, that each has some demon of the pit watching him incessantly, and commissioned specially for his utter destruction. How terrible must be the skill of such assailants, experienced in the arts which have deceived mankind since the first fatal day. But there is the limit of external power in this matter; the ablest and subtlest fiend can but guess what is passing in its victim's mind, and shape its snares accordingly. God only is the discerner of hearts, and the "spirit of man which is in him" alone, with its Maker, "knoweth the things of a man" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1Corinthians 2:11</a>). The Holy Spirit "searcheth all things" (<a href="/james/1-10.htm" title="But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.">James 1:10</a>), and all are manifest in His sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm" title="Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.">Hebrews 4:13</a>), but to no less than His own omniscience. Satan, therefore, can merely act on his general knowledge of human nature, aided by particular guesses at the individual before him, whom he fain would destroy. He has learned too well the deep corruption of the heart, and knows what gaudy bait will most attract the longing and licentious eyes.<p><span class= "bld">Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of </span>(or, <span class= "ital">by</span>)<span class= "bld"> his own lust, and enticed.</span>--Evil humanity thrills responsive as a harp played by a cunning hand; but no power of hell can force its way through the barriers which God the Holy Ghost erects around the faithful and confiding soul: only by treason of the man himself can the great enemy enter in and reign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14</span> states the true origin of temptation.

Compare with this verse the description of the harlot in <a href="/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6-27</a>.
