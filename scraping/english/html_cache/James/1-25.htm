The "perfect law of freedom" refers to the Gospel, which liberates believers from the bondage of sin. In the context of James, this law is not a set of legalistic rules but a guide to living a life that reflects Christ's teachings. The concept of freedom here aligns with Jesus' words in <a href="/john/8-32.htm">John 8:32</a>, "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." The idea of looking intently suggests a deliberate and focused study, akin to the Bereans in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, who examined the Scriptures daily.<p><b>and continues to do so</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of perseverance in studying and applying God's Word. It is not enough to merely glance at the Scriptures; one must persist in their study and application. This continuous action is reminiscent of the call to meditate on the law day and night as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>. The ongoing nature of this study reflects a lifestyle of discipleship and commitment to spiritual growth.<p><b>not being a forgetful hearer</b><br>This part of the verse warns against the danger of hearing God's Word without retaining or acting upon it. The cultural context of the time placed a strong emphasis on oral tradition and memory, making the act of forgetting particularly significant. Jesus' parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19-23</a> illustrates how the Word can be snatched away if not properly received and remembered. The call is to internalize the teachings, much like the Israelites were instructed to bind the law on their hearts (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>).<p><b>but an effective doer</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of action in the Christian faith. James consistently emphasizes that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The effective doer is one who not only hears the Word but also puts it into practice, reflecting the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>). This active obedience is a demonstration of genuine faith and aligns with the biblical principle that true belief results in transformed behavior.<p><b>he will be blessed in what he does</b><br>The promise of blessing is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with obedience to God's commands. This blessing is not necessarily material but encompasses spiritual prosperity and fulfillment. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> describes the blessed man as one who delights in the law of the Lord and prospers in all he does. The assurance of blessing serves as motivation for believers to live out their faith actively and consistently, trusting in God's faithfulness to reward those who diligently seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

He reads, as it were, upon his knees; and if he finds therein a law, it is one of liberty and not slavery, life and not death--although, as Dean Alford observes here, "not in contrast with a former law of bondage, but as viewed on the side of its being the law of the new life and birth, with all its spontaneous and free development of obedience."<p><span class= "bld">Not a forgetful hearer . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">not a hearer of forgetfulness, but a doer of work.</span> Thus rendered, the words of the sentence balance each other, and comment is needless.<p><span class= "bld">This man shall be blessed in his deed.</span>--Or, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">doing.</span> A return perhaps in thought to the Beatitudes, and the close of that Sermon on the Mount, of which they were the opening words.
