The terms "brother" and "sister" reflect the spiritual kinship among believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>, where Jesus refers to His followers as His family. This language underscores the expectation of care and support within the Christian community.<p><b>is without clothes</b><br>The lack of clothing signifies extreme poverty and vulnerability. In the historical context of the early church, many believers faced economic hardships, often due to persecution or social ostracism. Clothing in biblical times was a basic necessity, and its absence would have been a clear indicator of need. This echoes the call for compassion and action found in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>, where sharing with the needy is a sign of true worship.<p><b>and daily food.</b><br>The mention of "daily food" points to the immediate and ongoing needs of sustenance. In the ancient world, food insecurity was a common issue, and the early church often organized to provide for those in need, as seen in <a href="/acts/6.htm">Acts 6:1-4</a>. This phrase calls to mind the Lord's Prayer in <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>, where believers are taught to pray for "daily bread," emphasizing reliance on God for provision and the importance of meeting the physical needs of others as an expression of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus.

This reflects the communal aspect of the early church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love.htm">Practical Love</a></b><br>Love is not just an emotion but a tangible action.
