The concept of fulfillment is central to biblical theology, where events in the New Testament are seen as the realization of Old Testament prophecies. This particular fulfillment refers to <a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, where God makes a covenant with Abraham. The idea of Scripture being fulfilled underscores the continuity and reliability of God's Word throughout the Bible.<p><b>&#8220;Abraham believed God,</b><br>Abraham's belief is a foundational example of faith in the Bible. His faith was not merely intellectual assent but a deep trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seemed impossible, such as the promise of a son in his old age. This belief is highlighted in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8-12</a>, where Abraham's faith is commended. Abraham's faith is a model for believers, illustrating that true faith involves trust and obedience to God.<p><b>and it was credited to him as righteousness,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the doctrine of justification by faith, a key tenet in Christian theology. Righteousness was "credited" or "imputed" to Abraham not because of his works but because of his faith. This concept is further explored in <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3-5</a>, where Paul uses Abraham's example to explain that righteousness comes through faith, not works. The idea of imputed righteousness is central to understanding salvation in the New Testament.<p><b>and he was called a friend of God.</b><br>Being called a "friend of God" signifies a close, personal relationship with the Creator. This title is unique and denotes a special status, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, where Abraham is referred to as God's friend. This relationship is based on trust and obedience, highlighting the intimacy that can exist between God and those who have faith in Him. It also foreshadows the relationship believers can have with God through Jesus Christ, who calls His followers friends in <a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.
