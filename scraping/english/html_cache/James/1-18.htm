The concept of being "born again" is central to Christian theology, as seen in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, where Jesus tells Nicodemus that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God. This new birth is not a result of human effort but a divine act of grace, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which underscores salvation as a gift from God. The imagery of birth signifies a new beginning and transformation, reflecting the radical change in identity and status for believers.<p><b>through the word of truth</b><br>The "word of truth" refers to the gospel message, the good news of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for the salvation of humanity. This aligns with passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, where the "word of truth" is equated with the gospel of salvation. The phrase underscores the power and necessity of the gospel in the process of spiritual rebirth, as faith comes from hearing the message of Christ (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The truth of the gospel stands in contrast to the false teachings and philosophies prevalent in the world, highlighting the importance of sound doctrine.<p><b>that we would be a kind of firstfruits</b><br>The term "firstfruits" has rich Old Testament connotations, referring to the initial portion of the harvest offered to God as a sign of gratitude and dedication (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>). In the New Testament context, believers are seen as the firstfruits of God's new creation, indicating their special status and role in God's redemptive plan. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>, where believers are described as having the firstfruits of the Spirit. The idea of firstfruits also points to the eschatological hope of a future harvest, where God's kingdom will be fully realized.<p><b>of His creation</b><br>This phrase highlights the broader scope of God's redemptive work, which encompasses all of creation. It reflects the biblical narrative of creation, fall, and redemption, where God is actively restoring and renewing the world through Christ. <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-20</a> speaks of Christ's preeminence in creation and His role in reconciling all things to Himself.

Just as Israel was &#8220;a people for His own possession&#8221; by divine election (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>), believers today stand secure because the Father freely set His love upon us.

And the fruition of this hope is foreshadowed in the words above. "The very struggles," it has been well observed by Dean Howson, "which all animated beings make against pain and death show that pain and death are not a part of the proper laws of their nature, but rather a bondage imposed upon them from without; thus every groan and fear is an unconscious prophecy of liberation from the power of evil." "The creature itself also shall be delivered" is the plain assertion of St. Paul (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>); comparing his with that of St. James, we must conclude that they point to all nature, animate and inanimate as well. "We look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>), and "there shall be no more death . . . nor any more pain" (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Begat</span>; literally, <span class="accented">brought forth</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>.
