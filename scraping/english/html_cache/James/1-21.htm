The term "moral filth" suggests impurity and corruption, often associated with the sinful nature of humanity. In biblical context, this aligns with the call to holiness found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a>, where God commands His people to be holy as He is holy. The phrase "every expression of evil" encompasses all forms of wickedness, echoing the comprehensive nature of sin described in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. The imagery of "getting rid" suggests a cleansing or purging, akin to the purification rituals in the Old Testament, which were necessary for approaching God. This reflects the need for believers to live in a manner worthy of their calling (<a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>).<p><b>and humbly accept the word planted in you</b><br>The call to "humbly accept" indicates a posture of submission and openness to God's instruction. Humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, which states that God gives grace to the humble. The "word planted in you" suggests the transformative power of the Gospel, which takes root in the believer's heart. This imagery of planting is reminiscent of the Parable of the Sower in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, where the seed represents the word of God. The idea of the word being "planted" implies that it is meant to grow and bear fruit, as seen in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him to bear much fruit. This phrase emphasizes the importance of internalizing and living out the teachings of Scripture.<p><b>which can save your souls</b><br>The phrase "which can save your souls" underscores the salvific power of the word of God. Salvation is a central theme in the New Testament, with the soul representing the eternal aspect of human existence. This aligns with the message of <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>, where the Gospel is described as the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. The assurance of salvation is a cornerstone of Christian faith, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, which promises eternal life to those who believe in Jesus Christ. The phrase also highlights the ongoing process of sanctification, where believers are continually being saved from the power of sin, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>. This reflects the transformative impact of God's word in the life of a believer, leading to ultimate redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

All such a rank and poisonous crop must be gathered and laid aside, in caps may be, for some fiery trouble to consume, that out of the dead luxuriant weeds a richer soil for virtue may be made.<p><span class= "bld">Naughtiness</span> (<span class= "ital">ne-aughtiness, </span>or <span class= "ital">nothingness</span>) was used in 1611, instead of the older and more correct translation, <span class= "ital">malice</span> or <span class= "ital">maliciousness.</span> The badness implied in the original is much more positive than that which appears from our present version.<p><span class= "bld">Receive with meekness the engrafted word.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">in mildness accept ye this word of truth</span> (see <a href="/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">James 1:18</a>, above), engrafted, like a good olive tree, or rather <span class= "ital">implanted, </span>in you. The term is peculiar to this place, and means "innate" in its first intention. If taken so, "the innate Word" will be Christ Himself formed within us. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Able to save your souls.</span>--In like manner Paul at Miletus commends the elders of Ephesus "to God, and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified" (<a href="/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>). Observe, the idea of salvation thus conveyed by the implanted word, is so potentially and not actually. Tended and cultured, it will grow into a tree of life, the fruit whereof may heal the wounds of sin; but the after-growth of this plant of God is largely in the hands of man. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - With the form of expression in this verse, comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, "Putting away, therefore, all wickedness (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings, as new-born babes long for the spiritual milk," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Filthiness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Here only in the New Testament, never in LXX.; but the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is the word used of the "filthy garments" in <a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3, 4</a> - a narrative which illustrates the passage before us. <span class="accented">Karts</span> is not vice in general, but rather that vicious nature which is bent on doing harm to others (see Lightfoot on <a href="/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>). Thus the two words <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> comprise two classes of sins - the sensual and the malignant, <span class="cmt_word">Engrafted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">implanted.</span> The word is only found again in Wisd. 12:10, where it signifies "inborn." St. James's teaching here is almost like a reminiscence of the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>, etc.). The "implanted Word" is the gospel teaching.
