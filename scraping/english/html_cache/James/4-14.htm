In biblical context, it reflects the wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/27.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a>, which advises against boasting about the future. The unpredictability of life is a theme throughout Scripture, reminding believers of their dependence on God&#8217;s sovereignty. Historically, this would resonate with early Christians who faced persecution and uncertainty about their future. It underscores the need for humility and trust in God&#8217;s plan, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>, where Jesus teaches not to worry about tomorrow.<p><b>What is your life?</b><br>This rhetorical question invites introspection about the nature and purpose of life. It echoes the existential inquiries found in Ecclesiastes, where the brevity and seeming futility of life are explored. The question challenges believers to consider their priorities and the eternal perspective, aligning with Jesus&#8217; teachings in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a> about the value of the soul over worldly gain. It calls for a reflection on living a life that honors God, as seen in the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>.<p><b>You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.</b><br>This metaphor highlights the transient nature of human existence. The imagery of mist or vapor is used in <a href="/job/7-7.htm">Job 7:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a> to convey life's fleetingness. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, where life was often short and unpredictable, this would be a poignant reminder of mortality. Theologically, it points to the eternal nature of God in contrast to human temporality, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>. It also serves as a call to focus on eternal matters, encouraging believers to store treasures in heaven, as Jesus taught in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus.

We map out schedules, draft five-year plans, and assume we will wake up to carry them out, yet Scripture reminds us that tomorrow is outside our jurisdiction. <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a> echoes the same warning: &#8220;Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.&#8221; Jesus uses similar language in <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>, steering anxious hearts away from the unseen future and back to present dependence on the Father. The parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-20</a>) drives the lesson home&#8212;plans built on self-confidence can evaporate overnight.<p>&#8226; The verse presses us toward humility; all of life sits under God&#8217;s sovereign timetable.<p>&#8226; It also calls for flexibility: plans should always be penciled in with &#8220;If the Lord wills&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing the future is God&#8217;s domain, not ours, and that frees us to obey today without paralyzing fear of what might happen next.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What is your life?</b><p>This probing question pauses our frantic planning and asks us to take inventory. <a href="/psalms/39-4.htm">Psalm 39:4-5</a> pleads, &#8220;O LORD, make me know my end and the measure of my days&#8230;surely every man at his best state is but a vapor.&#8221; Recognizing human limits is not morbid; it is clarifying.<p>&#8226; Life&#8217;s true worth lies not in length but in alignment with God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;&#8220;Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Self-examination dismantles pride; when we see how small we are, we marvel at how great God is.<p>&#8226; The question also redirects priorities: if life is short, only what is done for Christ will endure (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are a mist that appears for a little while</b><p>James moves from question to illustration.
