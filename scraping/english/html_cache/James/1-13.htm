The Greek word for "tempted" can also mean "tested," indicating both trials and enticements to sin. In the biblical context, temptation often serves as a test of faith, as seen in the trials of Job or the testing of Abraham. Understanding temptation as a test can help believers see it as an opportunity for spiritual growth.<p><b>no one should say, &#8220;God is tempting me.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility in the face of temptation. It reflects the biblical teaching that God is holy and cannot be the source of evil. The Israelites in the wilderness often blamed God for their hardships, but James corrects this misunderstanding. Theologically, this aligns with the nature of God as depicted throughout Scripture, where God is consistently portrayed as righteous and just.<p><b>For God cannot be tempted by evil</b><br>This statement underscores the absolute holiness and purity of God. Unlike humans, God is not susceptible to evil influences. This is consistent with the portrayal of God in the Old Testament, where His holiness is a central theme, as seen in Isaiah's vision (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The idea that God is beyond temptation assures believers of His unchanging nature and perfect goodness.<p><b>nor does He tempt anyone</b><br>God's role in the life of believers is to guide and support, not to lead them into sin. This aligns with the Lord's Prayer, where Jesus teaches His followers to pray, "Lead us not into temptation" (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). Theologically, this reflects God's desire for His people to pursue righteousness and holiness, as He provides a way out of temptation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). This assurance encourages believers to trust in God's provision and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally identified as James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

The source is internal, not divine.<p>&#8226; Jesus teaches us to pray, &#8220;Lead us not into temptation&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>), highlighting our need for God&#8217;s protective guidance, not suggesting He pushes us toward sin.<p>&#8226; When temptation comes, we can confidently seek deliverance, knowing God stands against the tempter with us (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a> settles the question of blame. Temptation is real, but it never originates with God. His holy nature makes evil repulsive to Him and excludes any possibility that He would entice us toward sin. We are responsible for our responses, yet God faithfully provides the grace and escape we need to stand firm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/james/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.</span>--Far be it from the true Christian either to give way to sin "that grace may abound" (<a href="/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>), or to suppose for one moment that God, and therefore power invincible, is drawing him from righteousness. Almost every reflection upon the nature of sin leads up to an inquiry as to its cause; and the enigma will hardly be solved in this life. The very facts of the presence of evil amongst God's creatures, and its continual attraction even for the best, have often driven men to doubt His supremacy. Sadly--how can we of charity think otherwise?--some have felt the pain, but not the purpose of the world. At times they cannot see in nature "the work of a Being at once good and omnipotent," and prefer to doubt the latter quality sooner than the former.<span class= "note">[14]</span> But this nineteenth-century conclusion is no advance beyond the dual system of the Persians, or rather, of Manes, who corrupted with his Indian fancies the faith of Zoroaster. The Manichees settled the difficulty better than our Deists by declaring the existence of a good God and a bad one; and appealed to the daily strife between virtue and vice, nay, life and death, in witness of their simple creed. Thanks to the gospel, a nobler theology is our Christian heritage, whereby we are persuaded that good will triumph at the last, and by which we are taught humility withal to own that God's ways in so permitting and overworking evil are beyond man's comprehension. And a better scepticism remains for us than that of the Theist, or Agnostic either; a disbelief more vehement that here can be the end, since in this life we experience in no sense the rewards of just and unjust to the full.<p><span class= "note">[14] Specially see J. S. Mill's "Three Essays on Religion." <span class= "ital">Nature, </span>p. 38.</span><p><span class= "bld">For God cannot be tempted with evil.</span>--We can see here a good instance of the excellence of the old Geneva Bible, "the first on several occasions to seize the exact meaning of a passage which all the preceding versions had missed." Our present rendering follows the Genevan exactly, rejecting those of Wiclif. "God is not a tempter of yuell things"; Tyndale, "God tempteth not vnto evyll"; and Cranmer, "God cannot tempte vnto euyll."<p><span class= "bld">Neither tempteth he any man.</span>--The trial comes of Him, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Tempter is allowed; but so far, and no further. God Himself is "unversed of evils," and no possibility of temptation remains with Him. Into the unseen splendour of His fulness no thought of wrong can enter; no foul thing wing its silent flight. It were blasphemy, perilously near that of the Pharisees (<a href="/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22-37</a>) to think God's kingdom could be so divided against itself, that He, directly or indirectly, should seduce His subjects into the revolt of sin. No; if we have one golden clue by which we may feel our erring way out of the labyrinth of this lower world into the belief and trust in God our Father for the life to come, it is this: trials and temptations are permitted to strengthen us--if we will--for His mightier service. And, as compulsory homage would be worthless to the loving Lord of all, voluntary must be found instead, and proved and perfected. Herein is the Christian conflict, and the secret of God's ways with man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - God is not the author of temptation; cf.
