In biblical times, mirrors were typically made of polished metal, offering a less clear reflection than modern glass mirrors. This metaphor implies a superficial or incomplete self-assessment. The act of observing oneself can be compared to the introspection encouraged in <a href="/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>, where believers are urged to examine themselves to see if they are in the faith. The mirror here represents the Word of God, which reveals the true nature of one's heart and actions.<p><b>goes away</b><br>The action of going away indicates a departure from the moment of reflection. This can symbolize a return to daily life without applying the insights gained from the Word. In the cultural context of the early church, there was a strong emphasis on living out one's faith through actions, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The idea of going away without change highlights the danger of being a hearer of the Word but not a doer.<p><b>and immediately forgets</b><br>The immediacy of forgetting underscores the transient nature of the reflection. This can be likened to the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13-19.htm">Matthew 13:19</a>, where the seed sown along the path is quickly snatched away by the evil one. The quickness of forgetting suggests a lack of depth in one's spiritual life, where the truths of Scripture do not take root. It serves as a warning against superficial engagement with God's Word.<p><b>what he looks like</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the loss of self-awareness and understanding. In a spiritual sense, it reflects a failure to recognize one's true identity in Christ and the areas needing transformation. The Bible often speaks of the importance of remembering God's works and commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, where the Israelites are cautioned not to forget the Lord who brought them out of Egypt. Forgetting one's reflection in the mirror of God's Word can lead to a life that does not reflect Christ, who is the ultimate image of God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, traditionally understood to be James, the brother of Jesus and a leader in the early Jerusalem church.

There is a recognition of the well-known face, followed by instant and complete forgetfulness; and thus is it often with the mirror of the soul. In some striking sermon or book a man's self is made manifest to him, and the picture may be too familiar to cause aversion; but, whether or no, the impression fades from his mind as quickly as the echoes of the preacher's words. At the best the knowledge was only superficial, perhaps momentary; widely different from that which comes of a holy walk with God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - Observe the tenses; literally, <span class="accented">He considered</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">himself</span>, <span class="accented">and has gone away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), <span class="accented">and straightway forgot</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) <span class="accented">what he was like</span> (compare note on ver. 11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/james/1-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
