Elijah's prayer life is a model of fervent and effective prayer, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42-45</a>. His prayers were aligned with God's will, showcasing the power of righteous prayer. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, which emphasizes the effectiveness of a righteous person's prayer. Elijah's example encourages believers to pray persistently and with faith, trusting in God's timing and sovereignty.<p><b>and the heavens gave rain</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the miraculous end of a three-and-a-half-year drought in Israel, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>. The drought was a divine judgment due to Israel's idolatry under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. Elijah's prayer for rain was a demonstration of God's mercy and power, affirming His control over nature. The rain symbolizes God's provision and blessing, restoring the land and the people. This event also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises and His responsiveness to the prayers of His people.<p><b>and the earth yielded its crops</b><br>The yielding of crops signifies the restoration and renewal of the land following the drought. This agricultural abundance is a sign of God's blessing and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>, where obedience to God results in prosperity and fruitful harvests. The return of rain and crops also underscores the interconnectedness of creation and the Creator's sustaining power. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and fruitfulness that comes from divine intervention and obedience to God's will. It points to the ultimate restoration and abundance found in Christ, who is the source of all spiritual blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament known for his powerful prayers and miracles, including the cessation and subsequent return of rain in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>Refers to the sky or the atmosphere, which withheld rain during Elijah's initial prayer and later released it upon his subsequent prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The land of Israel, which experienced drought and then abundance as a result of Elijah's prayers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation that experienced a severe drought due to its disobedience and idolatry, which was later relieved through Elijah's intercession.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/james.htm">James</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, who uses Elijah's example to teach about the power of prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_prayer.htm">The Power of Prayer</a></b><br>Elijah's example shows that prayer is a powerful tool for believers.

The word &#8220;again&#8221; highlights perseverance.<p>&#8226; Prayer is not a one-and-done exercise; Elijah&#8217;s sevenfold petitions on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-42.htm">1 Kings 18:42-44</a>) model steadfast faith.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere commends the same persistence: &#8220;pray without ceasing&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>), keep &#8220;knocking&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9-10</a>), and &#8220;do not lose heart&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>).<p>&#8226; James emphasizes that Elijah &#8220;was a man with a nature like ours&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>). Ordinary believers can expect God to hear when they keep seeking Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the heavens gave rain</b><p>God answers Elijah&#8217;s second season of prayer with a literal downpour (<a href="/1_kings/18-45.htm">1 Kings 18:45</a>).<p>&#8226; Rain is the Lord&#8217;s exclusive domain: &#8220;Are there any among the idols of the nations that can give rain? &#8230; Is it not You, O LORD our God?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; He uses it as both blessing and discipline (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-17</a>). After three and a half years of judgment drought, the opened heavens prove God&#8217;s mercy in response to repentance (<a href="/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that the &#8220;effective prayer of a righteous man has great power&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). Whenever believers witness answered prayer&#8212;even in areas that seem fixed by natural law&#8212;they can trace every drop back to God&#8217;s gracious hand (<a href="/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the earth yielded its crops</b><p>Rain is never an end in itself; it nurtures the harvest.<p>&#8226; The promise echoes <a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>: &#8220;I will send you rain in its season, and the land will yield its produce.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Physical fruitfulness points to spiritual fruitfulness.
