The mention of Boaz as a "relative" is crucial, as it sets the stage for the concept of the kinsman-redeemer, a key theme in the Book of Ruth. According to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), a kinsman-redeemer had the responsibility to redeem a relative in serious difficulty, which could include marrying a widow to preserve the family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). Ruth's connection to Boaz through Naomi highlights the providential care of God in providing for Ruth and Naomi's future. The reference to Ruth working with Boaz's servant girls underscores her diligence and the favor she has found in Boaz's eyes, which is a testament to her character and God's provision.<p><b>In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley on the threshing floor.</b><br>The threshing floor was a significant location in ancient agricultural society, often situated on elevated ground to take advantage of the wind for separating grain from chaff. The process of winnowing involved tossing the harvested grain into the air so that the wind would blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the heavier grain to fall back to the ground. This activity typically took place in the evening when the breezes were more predictable. The mention of Boaz winnowing barley indicates the time of the barley harvest, which is in the spring, around the time of the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost). This setting not only provides a backdrop for the unfolding events but also symbolizes a time of provision and blessing. The threshing floor is also a place of transformation and revelation, as seen in other biblical narratives (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>), and it foreshadows the pivotal encounter between Ruth and Boaz that will lead to their eventual marriage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem to seek refuge and provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>Ruth's mother-in-law, who has returned to Bethlehem after the death of her husband and sons.

Earlier we read, &#8220;Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great wealth&#8230; whose name was Boaz&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>). Naomi&#8217;s question is rhetorical, almost a gentle nudge: &#8220;Remember who Boaz is.&#8221; By calling Boaz to mind, she is recalling the Lord&#8217;s provision&#8212;Boaz is no random acquaintance; he is the one the LORD used to protect Ruth in the fields (<a href="/ruth/2-8.htm">Ruth 2:8-12</a>). Just as God provided Joseph for Israel in famine (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7-8</a>), He has placed Boaz in Ruth&#8217;s life at exactly the right moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with whose servant girls you have been working</b><p>Naomi emphasizes Ruth&#8217;s existing relationship with Boaz&#8217;s household. Ruth has labored side-by-side with Boaz&#8217;s maidservants (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17-23</a>).<p>&#8226; This shared work matters: Old Testament gleaning laws (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) allowed the poor to gather behind harvesters, and Ruth has consistently honored those statutes.<p>&#8226; Boaz has already praised Ruth&#8217;s diligence and kindness (<a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11-12</a>), creating a foundation of respect and trust.<p>&#8226; The familiarity makes Naomi&#8217;s upcoming plan less abrupt; Ruth will approach a man who already knows her sterling character, just as Esther later approached the king after months of building credibility (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a relative of ours?</b><p>Here Naomi explicitly identifies Boaz as kin. The word &#8220;relative&#8221; points to the biblical role of a kinsman-redeemer (<a href="/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>).<p>&#8226; A redeemer had both the right and the duty to rescue family members from poverty, slavery, or loss of inheritance (<a href="/leviticus/25-47.htm">Leviticus 25:47-49</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting kinship, Naomi underscores that Boaz is qualified to redeem Elimelech&#8217;s land and marry Ruth, preserving the family line (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The question form (&#8220;is he not&#8230;?&#8221;) moves Ruth toward recognizing God&#8217;s provision&#8212;similar to how Moses reminded Israel, &#8220;Is not the LORD your God with you?&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In fact, tonight he is winnowing barley</b><p>Naomi shifts from identity to timing. Harvest season is closing, and Boaz will be working late into the evening, tossing grain in the breeze to separate chaff (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a> shows the same activity).<p>&#8226; Winnowing required calm, usually nighttime breezes; Naomi knows Boaz&#8217;s routine.<p>&#8226; The statement &#8220;tonight&#8221; signals urgency and a God-ordained window, echoing moments when God told His people to act &#8220;this night&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-42.htm">Exodus 12:42</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting foreshadows redemption: just as grain is purified, God is about to refine Ruth&#8217;s circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the threshing floor.</b><p>The threshing floor was a communal, open space where grain was threshed and guarded overnight (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It doubled as a place of celebration (<a href="/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a>) yet also symbolized judgment and deliverance (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s strategy places Ruth where Boaz will be alone yet within the safety of community boundaries.<p>&#8226; Historically, threshing floors became sites of significant covenant moments&#8212;David later purchased one that became the Temple mount (<a href="/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18-25</a>). Naomi likely senses that God is about to establish another covenant-shaping act here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a> is Naomi&#8217;s faith-filled prompt: &#8220;God has already provided Boaz&#8212;our relative, your respectful employer&#8212;who will be working tonight at the threshing floor.&#8221; Each phrase layers truth upon truth: God&#8217;s providence (&#8220;Boaz&#8221;), Ruth&#8217;s proven character (&#8220;working with his servant girls&#8221;), covenant opportunity (&#8220;a relative of ours&#8221;), divine timing (&#8220;tonight&#8221;), and appointed place (&#8220;on the threshing floor&#8221;). The verse invites us to trust that the LORD orchestrates people, relationships, timing, and settings to accomplish redemption for His people, just as He ultimately did through Christ, our greater Redeemer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now is not Boaz, with whose young women thou wast, our relatives.</span> Naomi opens her case. She had been studying Boaz all through the harvest season. She had been studying Ruth too. She saw unmistakable evidence of mutual responsiveness and attachment. And now she had a matured scheme in her head. Hence she brings up Boaz's name at once, and says, "Is he not our relative?" <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, an abstract term used concretely, meaning literally" acquaintance," but here "relative," or "kinsman" (see <a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, he is</span> <span class="cmt_word">winnowing barley on the threshing-floor tonight.</span> Literally, "<span class="accented">Lo</span>, he is winnowing the threshing-floor of barley." The Hebrews could idiomatically speak of "the threshing-floor of barley," meaning "the threshing-floor-full of barley." The barley lay heaped up in Boaz's threshing-floor, and he was changed in winnowing it. He threw up against the wind the mingled mass that was on his floor, after the stalks had been carefully trodden or beaten. "Not far," says Dr. Horatio Hackett, "from the site of ancient Corinth, I passed a heap of grain, which some laborers were employed in winnowing. They used for throwing up the mingled wheat and chaff a three-pronged wooden fork, having a handle three or four feet long" ('Illustrations,' p. 106). "The winnowing," says Dr. Kitto, "<span class="accented">was</span> performed by throwing up the grain with a fork against the wind, by which the chaff and broken straw were dispersed, and the grain fell to the ground. The grain was afterwards passed through a sieve to separate the morsels of earth and other impurities, and it then underwent a final purification by being tossed up with wooden scoops, or shorthanded shovels, such as we see sculptured on the monuments of Egypt" ('Illustrations,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>., p. 40). In some of the Egyptian sculptures the winnowers are represented as having scoops in both hands. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tonight</span> (Scottice, "the nicht"). The agriculturist in Palestine and the surrounding districts would often carry on his winnowing operations after sunset, taking advantage of the evening breeze that then blows.
