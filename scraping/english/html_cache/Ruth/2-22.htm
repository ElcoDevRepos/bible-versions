This relationship is significant as it highlights the loyalty and devotion Ruth has for Naomi, choosing to stay with her despite the cultural and ethnic differences. Naomi's guidance reflects her protective and maternal role, emphasizing the familial bond that transcends bloodlines, a theme that resonates throughout the book of Ruth.<p><b>&#8220;My daughter,</b><br>Naomi's use of "my daughter" signifies a deep affection and acceptance of Ruth into her family. This term of endearment underscores the close relationship they share, despite Ruth being a foreigner. It also reflects the biblical theme of adoption and inclusion, which is seen in the New Testament where believers are adopted into the family of God (<a href="/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>).<p><b>it is good for you to work with his young women,</b><br>Naomi advises Ruth to stay with Boaz's young women, indicating the importance of community and protection within the social structure of ancient Israel. Working with Boaz's female servants ensures Ruth's safety and provides her with a sense of belonging. This advice also foreshadows the providential care that God extends to Ruth, as Boaz is a kinsman-redeemer, a concept that prefigures Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>so that nothing will happen to you in another field.&#8221;</b><br>Naomi's concern for Ruth's safety highlights the potential dangers faced by women gleaning alone in the fields during the time of the Judges, a period marked by social instability and moral decline (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). By staying in Boaz's field, Ruth is protected from harm, illustrating God's provision and care.

"<span class="accented">It</span> is good," says Naomi, "that 'they' do not set upon thee in another field." She <span class="accented">says</span> "<span class="accented">they</span>," but allows the parties she had in view to remain, dimly visible, in the shade. No doubt, however, she refers to the reapers, binders, gleaners, and other workers who might have to be encountered "in another field." "<span class="accented">Meaning</span>," says homely Richard Bernard, "some lewd and lustful men whom Naomi would not so much as make mention of."
