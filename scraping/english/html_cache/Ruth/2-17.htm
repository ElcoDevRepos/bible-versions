This reflects the cultural practice of gleaning, where the poor and foreigners were allowed to gather leftover crops from the fields (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>). Ruth's actions demonstrate her commitment to providing for herself and Naomi, her mother-in-law. The setting is in Bethlehem during the barley harvest, a time of hope and provision after famine. This act of gleaning also foreshadows the provision and protection she will receive from Boaz, a type of Christ, who later becomes her kinsman-redeemer.<p><b>And when she beat out what she had gleaned,</b><br>The process of beating out the grain involved separating the edible part of the grain from the chaff, a task that required effort and skill. This reflects the agrarian lifestyle of ancient Israel, where such tasks were common. The act of threshing is often used metaphorically in Scripture to describe judgment and purification (<a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15-16</a>). Ruth's diligence in this task underscores her resourcefulness and determination, qualities that are rewarded later in the narrative.<p><b>it was about an ephah of barley.</b><br>An ephah is a unit of measure roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about half a bushel. This substantial amount indicates the abundance of Boaz's field and his generosity, as gleaners typically gathered much less. The provision of an ephah of barley not only meets Ruth and Naomi's immediate needs but also symbolizes God's providence and blessing. This abundance can be seen as a precursor to the greater blessings that come through Ruth's eventual marriage to Boaz, leading to the lineage of King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, fulfilling God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by staying with her and returning to Bethlehem.

Boaz&#8217;s obedience to this command opens the door for Ruth&#8217;s survival and eventual blessing.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that ordinary diligence is often God&#8217;s chosen channel for extraordinary grace, much like Paul&#8217;s call to &#8220;work with your own hands&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11-12</a>) so that our daily labor may win the respect of outsiders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when she beat out what she had gleaned,</b><p>&#8226; Beating out (threshing) separates kernels from the stalks&#8212;hard, dusty work, yet necessary before bread can be baked. <a href="/isaiah/28-28.htm">Isaiah 28:28</a> notes the purposeful, measured nature of threshing; God directs even the rough steps that lead to nourishment.<p>&#8226; Ruth does not delay this step; she finishes the job the same evening, mirroring the diligence urged in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>, &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In the bigger narrative, each swing of Ruth&#8217;s staff foreshadows how God will &#8220;beat out&#8221; redemption through trials, refining His people for future blessing (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it was about an ephah of barley.</b><p>&#8226; An ephah is roughly 30-35 pounds&#8212;a remarkable haul for one day&#8217;s gleaning. The weight underscores Boaz&#8217;s generosity (<a href="/ruth/2-15.htm">Ruth 2:15-16</a>) and God&#8217;s lavish care, recalling <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;My cup overflows.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such abundance anticipates the harvest imagery Jesus uses in <a href="/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11-13</a> when He multiplies bread until every basket brims; God&#8217;s supply consistently exceeds mere survival.<p>&#8226; Barley, the first crop of Israel&#8217;s agricultural year (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-14</a>), hints at firstfruits. Ruth&#8217;s ephah is an early sign of larger blessings to come: covenant inclusion, marriage to Boaz, and her place in the lineage of David and ultimately Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17</a> paints a vivid picture of diligent labor met by divine generosity.

Her story encourages believers to serve wholeheartedly, trust God&#8217;s laws of provision, and expect His overflowing grace to meet&#8212;and surpass&#8212;every genuine need.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Beat out.</span>--That is, she threshed it herself, so as to save the labour of carrying away the straw. She then found she had an ephah, that is, rather more than four pecks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she gleaned in the field until the evening, and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> Gathering together her various sheaves, lots, or bundles (see ver. 7), she threshed them with some suitable rod or simple 'flail' (<span class="accented">flagellum</span>), which she had either brought with her in the morning, as part of her equipment as a gleaner, or had obtained at the hut; or perhaps, like many others, she would make use of a convenient stone. Speaking of the village of Huj, near Gaza, Robinson says, "We found the lazy inhabitants still engaged in treading out the barley harvest, which their neighbors had completed long before. <span class="accented">Several women were beating out with a stick handfuls of the grain which they seemed to have gleaned</span>. One female was grinding with a hand mill, turning the mill with one hand, and occasionally dropping in the grain with the other" ('Researches,' vol. 2. p. 385). "In the evening," says Dr. W. M. Thomson, "you might see some poor woman or maiden, that had been permitted to glean on her own account, sitting by the roadside, and beating out with a stick or a stone what she had gathered, as Ruth did. I have often watched this process in various parts of the country" ('The Land and the, Book,' p. 647). The diligent gleaner on Boaz's field found, after threshing, that she had nearly an ephah of barley. It would be a considerable load for a female to curry - about a bushel. Josephus mentions incidentally, in his ' Antiquities' (15:9, 2), that the Hebrew <span class="accented">cot</span> or <span class="accented">homer</span> was equivalent to ten Attic <span class="accented">me>dimnoi</span>. But as the ephah was exactly the tenth part of a cor or homer, it follows that the Hebrew ephah was equivalent to the Attic <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Moreover, just as the ephah was the tenth part of a homer, so the omer was the tenth part of an ephah (<a href="/exodus/16-36.htm">Exodus 16:36</a>); and thus, if an omer of barley would be somewhat equivalent for nutritive purposes to an omer of manna, it would be a sufficient daily allowance for a man (see <a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16</a>). Hence Ruth would take home with her what would suffice for several days' sustenance to Naomi and herself. <p> CHAPTER 2:18-23. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Ruth gathered grain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;laq&#183;q&#234;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
