Ruth's actions demonstrate her gratitude and acknowledgment of Boaz's authority and kindness. This mirrors other biblical instances of bowing, such as Abraham's servant bowing in <a href="/genesis/24-26.htm">Genesis 24:26</a>, showing a deep respect and recognition of divine providence.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Why have I found such favor in your eyes</b><br>Ruth's question highlights her surprise and humility at receiving kindness from Boaz. The concept of "favor" is often associated with grace and unmerited kindness, reflecting God's grace towards humanity. This echoes the theme of divine favor found in <a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>, where Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord, suggesting a parallel between Ruth's situation and God's grace.<p><b>that you should take notice of me</b><br>Boaz's attention to Ruth is significant, as it reflects God's care for the marginalized and the outsider. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of God's concern for the vulnerable, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>, where God defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow. Boaz's actions prefigure Christ's ministry, where He often took notice of and ministered to those society overlooked.<p><b>even though I am a foreigner?&#8221;</b><br>Ruth's identity as a Moabite is crucial, as Moabites were often viewed with suspicion and hostility by Israelites due to historical enmity (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>). Her inclusion in the community of Israel through Boaz's kindness foreshadows the New Testament message of the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>.
