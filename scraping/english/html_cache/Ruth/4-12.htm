Perez's line is significant in Israel's history, as it leads to King David and ultimately to Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3-6</a>). The house of Perez is noted for its strength and prominence among the tribes of Israel. This blessing implies a hope for prosperity and enduring legacy for Boaz and Ruth's family, similar to the fruitful and influential lineage of Perez.<p><b>whom Tamar bore to Judah</b><br>This reference recalls the story in <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, where Tamar, Judah's daughter-in-law, bore Perez after a complex series of events. Tamar's actions ensured the continuation of Judah's line, which was crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham and Jacob. The mention of Tamar highlights themes of redemption and God's providence in using unexpected circumstances to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>because of the offspring the LORD will give you</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty in granting children and blessings. In the context of Ruth, it underscores the divine intervention in Ruth and Boaz's union, which was orchestrated by God to continue the lineage leading to David and Christ. The offspring, Obed, becomes the grandfather of David, linking Ruth and Boaz directly to the messianic line.<p><b>by this young woman.</b><br>Ruth, the young woman, is a Moabitess, which emphasizes the inclusivity of God's plan. Her inclusion in the genealogy of David and Jesus highlights God's grace and the breaking of ethnic barriers.

They are asking God to establish a dynasty through this marriage, the way He did for Abraham (&#8220;I will make you into a great nation,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>) and later for David (&#8220;Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me,&#8221; <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). Scripture consistently treats a stable, God-honoring household as His gift and workmanship (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;house&#8221; in biblical terms means people&#8212;spouses, children, grandchildren&#8212;bound together in covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Such a house is built not merely by human effort but by God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like the house of Perez,</b><p>Why single out Perez? Because his descendants were numerous, respected, and influential within Judah (<a href="/numbers/26-20.htm">Numbers 26:20&#8211;21</a>). Perez&#8217;s line became a symbol of strength and expansion: &#8220;The sons of Perez numbered 2,518&#8221; even during Israel&#8217;s wilderness years. By citing Perez, the elders envision Boaz&#8217;s future family multiplying and taking a prominent place among God&#8217;s people&#8212;anticipating kings like David (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>) and ultimately the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; In Hebrew culture, naming Perez (&#8220;bursting forth&#8221;) already hinted at rapid growth (<a href="/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The tribe of Judah, to which Boaz belongs, traces its royal credentials through Perez, reinforcing the blessing&#8217;s royal undertone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom Tamar bore to Judah,</b><p>Mentioning Tamar recalls an unexpected yet divinely directed story (<a href="/bsb/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>). Although human choices were messy, God preserved the promise line through Tamar&#8217;s courageous pursuit of offspring. By invoking her name, the elders acknowledge that God often works through surprising, even scandal-scarred situations to advance His redemptive plan. Matthew includes Tamar in Jesus&#8217; genealogy to show the same (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Tamar&#8217;s perseverance ensured Judah&#8217;s line would not die out, foreshadowing Ruth&#8217;s own faithfulness to Naomi.<p>&#8226; Both Tamar and Ruth were Gentile women grafted into Israel, illustrating God&#8217;s heart for the outsider.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of the offspring</b><p>The blessing zeroes in on children&#8212;&#8220;offspring&#8221; that will carry covenant promises forward. This is covenant language, echoing the promise to Abraham: &#8220;your offspring will possess the gate of their enemies&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The elders believe God is still writing His story through each new generation.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18</a>, the narrator immediately lists Perez&#8217;s genealogy, linking this blessing to tangible descendants.<p>&#8226; Scripture views children not merely as biological results but as arrows in God&#8217;s quiver (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD will give you</b><p>Children are granted, not guaranteed. &#8220;Every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The elders openly recognize Yahweh&#8217;s sovereign hand over the womb, just as He opened Hannah&#8217;s (<a href="/1_samuel/2-20.htm">1 Samuel 2:20&#8211;21</a>) and Rebekah&#8217;s (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>). Boaz and Ruth&#8217;s upcoming child will be evidence of divine kindness, not mere human achievement.<p>&#8226; God delights to reward faithful obedience with fruitfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>).<p>&#8226; His giving underscores that lineage in Scripture is always a story of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by this young woman.</b><p>Finally, the blessing spotlights Ruth herself. She is called &#8220;this young woman,&#8221; a term of affection and honor in context. Ruth&#8217;s loyalty (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>) and industrious spirit (<a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11-12</a>) have already drawn public admiration. Now the elders affirm that God will use her, a Moabite convert, to extend Judah&#8217;s heritage. <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a> reminds us that &#8220;a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised,&#8221; and Ruth embodies that truth.<p>&#8226; Ruth&#8217;s inclusion showcases God&#8217;s pattern of grafting willing outsiders into His covenant people (<a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Her story proves that faith, not pedigree, qualifies a person for God&#8217;s redemptive purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/4-12.htm">Ruth 4:12</a> is a heartfelt, Spirit-guided blessing: the community prays that Boaz and Ruth&#8217;s marriage will birth a flourishing, influential family line like that of Perez. It underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty in granting children, celebrates the surprising ways He weaves broken stories into His redemption plan, and anticipates the royal lineage culminating in David and Jesus.
