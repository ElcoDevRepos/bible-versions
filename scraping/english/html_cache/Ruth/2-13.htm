This reflects the cultural norms of ancient Israel, where social hierarchies were respected. The use of "lord" is not only a sign of respect but also an acknowledgment of Boaz's role as a potential redeemer, a concept that foreshadows Christ as the ultimate Redeemer.<p><b>&#8220;may I continue to find favor in your eyes,&#8221;</b><br>Ruth seeks ongoing grace and kindness from Boaz, which is significant in the context of her being a foreigner and a widow. This request for favor echoes the biblical theme of grace, where God's unmerited favor is extended to those who seek Him. It also parallels the favor Mary found with God in <a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>.<p><b>&#8220;for you have comforted and spoken kindly to your maidservant,&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's actions towards Ruth are characterized by compassion and kindness, reflecting the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor.

The term "maidservant" indicates Ruth's humility and her acceptance of a lowly position, similar to the humility Christ demonstrated.<p><b>&#8220;though I am not like one of your servant girls.&#8221;</b><br>Ruth acknowledges her status as an outsider, emphasizing her Moabite heritage. This highlights the inclusivity of God's plan, as Ruth, a Gentile, is grafted into the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus.

Her polite greeting reflects the humility expected of God&#8217;s people when they approach one who is greater (<a href="/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-15.htm">1 Samuel 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; In the wider narrative, Ruth&#8217;s deference underscores her submission not only to Boaz but ultimately to the LORD whose providence brought her to this field (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;may I continue to find favor in your eyes,</b><p>&#8226;

Ruth, a Moabite, now seeks that same covenant kindness.<p>&#8226; Earlier she set out hoping to &#8220;find favor&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-2.htm">Ruth 2:2</a>), and Boaz&#8217;s generosity assures her that God is answering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you have comforted</b><p>&#8226;

By calling herself &#8220;your maidservant,&#8221; Ruth places herself under Boaz&#8217;s protective care, foreshadowing the fuller request she will make in chapter 3.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though I am not like one of your servant girls.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;
