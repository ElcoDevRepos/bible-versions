It was a place where elders and leaders of the community would meet to discuss and resolve matters. Boaz's action of going to the gate indicates his intention to address the legal issue of redeeming Naomi's land and marrying Ruth. This setting underscores the public and legal nature of the proceedings, ensuring transparency and accountability. The gate also symbolizes a place of judgment and decision-making, reflecting Boaz's role as a man of integrity and responsibility.<p><b>Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along,</b><br>The concept of a kinsman-redeemer (Hebrew: "goel") is rooted in the Levitical law, where a close relative had the duty to redeem a family member in distress, whether by buying back land, marrying a widow, or avenging blood. This practice ensured the preservation of family lineage and property within the tribe. The arrival of the kinsman-redeemer highlights the providence of God in orchestrating events according to His plan. This role also foreshadows the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who is our ultimate Redeemer, restoring us to God.<p><b>and Boaz said, &#8220;Come over here, my friend, and sit down.&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's invitation to the kinsman-redeemer is both courteous and strategic. By addressing him as "my friend," Boaz maintains respect while preparing to discuss a serious matter. The term "friend" here is somewhat impersonal, possibly indicating that the man's name is intentionally left out of the narrative, emphasizing his decision's significance rather than his identity. Boaz's approach reflects wisdom and tact, ensuring the conversation occurs in a formal setting with witnesses present.<p><b>So he went over and sat down.</b><br>The kinsman-redeemer's compliance in sitting down signifies his willingness to engage in the legal discussion. This act of sitting down at the gate with Boaz and the elders signifies his readiness to fulfill or relinquish his duty as a redeemer. The narrative sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan through Boaz, who ultimately becomes the redeemer, marrying Ruth and continuing the lineage that leads to King David and, ultimately, to Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A prominent and wealthy man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a central figure in the Book of Ruth.

Boaz chooses the setting where legal matters must be settled, showing his respect for God-ordained order and transparency.<p>- His initiative reveals living faith&#8212;acting, not merely wishing (cf. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Boaz sat down there</b><p>- &#8220;&#8230;and sat down there.&#8221;<p>- Sitting marks readiness to preside, much like the husband in <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a> who &#8220;sits among the elders of the land.&#8221;<p>- It also pictures confident rest in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>); Boaz is poised, not passive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The kinsman-redeemer arrived</b><p>- &#8220;Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came along&#8230;&#8221;<p>- What looks like chance is providence (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).

Why the name is not recorded here does not appear; possibly it was not known to the writer, or it may have been thought unworthy of recording, since he neglected his plain duty in refusing to raise up seed to the dead.
