This role required leadership and accountability, ensuring that the work was done efficiently and fairly. The foreman's response indicates his awareness of the people working in the field, reflecting the close-knit nature of agrarian communities in biblical times.<p><b>She is the Moabitess</b><br>The term "Moabitess" identifies Ruth's ethnic background, highlighting her foreign status in Israel. Moab was a neighboring nation often at odds with Israel, and Moabites were generally viewed with suspicion or hostility. This detail underscores the remarkable nature of Ruth's acceptance and integration into the Israelite community, which foreshadows the inclusive nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>who returned with Naomi</b><br>Naomi's return to Bethlehem with Ruth marks a significant turning point in the narrative. Naomi, having left Bethlehem due to famine, returns after the death of her husband and sons, accompanied by her loyal daughter-in-law. This return signifies a movement from despair to hope, setting the stage for God's providential care and the unfolding of His redemptive plan.<p><b>from the land of Moab</b><br>Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was known for its rugged terrain and historical enmity with Israel. The mention of Moab emphasizes the cultural and religious barriers Ruth overcame to join Naomi.

Ruth&#8217;s origin, devotion, and humble presence in Boaz&#8217;s field prepare us to see the breadth of divine grace and the certainty that the Lord rewards those who take refuge in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6, 7) The steward gives a detailed account of Ruth. She is "the (rather "a") Moabitish damsel," she is a foreigner [as such she had a <span class= "ital">special </span>claim to the gleaning, <a href="/context/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>]. She is the daughter-in-law of Naomi; and he adds that her behaviour has been praiseworthy, for she asked leave before beginning to glean, and she has worked hard all day, save for a short interval of rest. It would seem that Boaz's visit to the field fell at the time when Ruth was thus resting: "This is her tarrying for a little in the house"; apparently, that is, some rude shelter from the heat set up in the field, like the <span class= "ital">lodge </span>of <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the young man who was set over the reapers replied and said, She is a Moabitish young woman who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab.</span> The young man had already received, no doubt from her own lips, particulars regarding the attractive stranger.
