This practice is rooted in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7-10</a>, where a sandal removal ceremony is described in the context of levirate marriage. The act signified the transfer of responsibility and rights from one party to another. In this context, the kinsman-redeemer, who had the first right of redemption, relinquishes his claim to Boaz. This act underscores the legal and cultural customs of the time, emphasizing the importance of family lineage and property inheritance in Israelite society.<p><b>and said to Boaz,</b><br>Boaz, a man of standing in Bethlehem, is a central figure in the Book of Ruth. His role as a kinsman-redeemer is pivotal, as he steps in to marry Ruth and preserve the family line of Elimelech, Naomi's deceased husband. This moment highlights Boaz's integrity and willingness to fulfill his duty under the law. The narrative sets Boaz as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate Redeemer who would come to restore and redeem humanity.<p><b>&#8220;Buy it for yourself.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates the transfer of the right to purchase the land and marry Ruth from the nearer kinsman to Boaz. This transaction not only involves property but also the continuation of a family line, which was crucial in Israelite culture. The act of buying the land and marrying Ruth ensures that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from among his family and town. This reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and restoration, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a> and <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-5</a>, where God redeems His people. Boaz's actions prefigure the redemptive work of Christ, who "purchased" believers with His sacrifice, ensuring their place in the family of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential man from Bethlehem, Boaz is a kinsman-redeemer for Naomi's family.

Josephus allowed his imagination to run off with his memory when, mixing up the historical case before us with the details of the ancient Levirate law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7-9</a>), which were, in later times at all events, more honored in the breach than in the observance, he represents Boaz as "bidding the woman loose the man's shoe and spit in his face." The actual ceremony was not an insult, but a graphic and inoffensive attestation. Yet it gradually wore out and was superseded. No vestige of it remained in the days of the writer, and the Chaldea Targumist seems to have been scarcely able to realize that such a custom could ever have existed, he represents the anonymous kinsman as drawing off his "right-hand glove" and handing it to Boas.
