At this point in the narrative, she is addressing her daughters-in-law, Ruth and Orpah, after the death of her husband and sons. Naomi's use of "Look" indicates a moment of decision and urgency. This reflects the dire circumstances she faces and her concern for the well-being of her daughters-in-law. Naomi's character is one of wisdom and care, as she seeks what she believes is best for Ruth and Orpah.<p><b>"your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods;"</b><br>Orpah, Ruth's sister-in-law, decides to return to Moab, her homeland. This decision highlights the cultural and religious differences between Moab and Israel. Moabites worshiped gods like Chemosh, contrasting with the monotheistic worship of Yahweh in Israel. Orpah's return signifies a choice to remain within her cultural and religious identity. This moment underscores the theme of loyalty and faith, as Ruth will choose a different path. The mention of "gods" also sets the stage for Ruth's later declaration of faith in the God of Israel.<p><b>"follow her back home."</b><br>Naomi encourages Ruth to follow Orpah's example, suggesting that returning to Moab might offer security and familiarity. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of women seeking protection within their familial and cultural structures. Naomi's suggestion is practical, considering the vulnerability of widows in that era. However, Ruth's subsequent decision to stay with Naomi and embrace her people and God becomes a pivotal moment in the narrative, showcasing her loyalty and foreshadowing her role in the lineage of King David and ultimately, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem who moved to Moab during a famine.

The verse exposes the stark divide between the way of the world and the way of covenant faith, urging every reader to decide where true home, true people, and the true God will be found.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) Naomi, now armed with a fresh argument, urges Ruth to follow her sister-in-law's example.<p><span class= "bld">Her gods.</span>--Naomi doubtless views the Moabite idols as realities, whose power is, however, confined to the land of Moab. She is not sufficiently enlightened in her religion to see in the Lord more than the God of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law.</span> The expression that stands in King James's version thus, "and to her gods," is rendered by Dr. Cassel "<span class="accented">and</span> to her God." The same interpretation, it is noteworthy, is given in the Targum of Jonathan, who renders the expression, "and to her Fear" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span>). Such a translation assumes that the Moabites were not only theists, but monotheists. And yet in the mythology, or primitive theology, of Moab, we read both of Baal-Peor and of Chemosh. As to the former, see <a href="/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8, 5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-3.htm">Deuteronomy 4:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>. As to the latter, see <a href="/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7, 33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7, 13</a>. In Numbers, moreover, 21:29, and in <a href="/jeremiah/48-46.htm">Jeremiah 48:46</a>, the Moabites are called the <span class="accented">people of Chemosh</span>, and frequently is their national god called Chemosh in the inscription of King Mesha on <span class="accented">the Moabitish Stone</span>, so recently discovered and deciphered. It is supposed, not without reason, that the two names belonged to one deity, Chemosh being the old native name. Nevertheless, the translation "to her god" is an interpretation, not a literal rendering, and, on the other hand, the translation "to her gods" would, on the hypothesis of the monotheism of the Moabites, be unidiomatic. The original expression, "to her Elohim," does not tell anything, and was not intended by Naomi to tell anything, or to hint anything, of a numerical character concerning the object or objects of the Moabitish worship. <span class="accented">It was an expression equally appropriate whether there was</span>, <span class="accented">or was not</span>, <span class="accented">a plurality of objects worshipped</span>. It might be liberally rendered, <span class="accented">and to her own forms of religious worship</span>. The word <span class="accented">elohim</span> was a survival of ancient polytheistic theology and worship, when a plurality of powers were held in awe. "<span class="accented">For</span>," says Fuller, "the heathen, supposing that the whole world, with all the creatures therein, was too great a diocese to be daily visited by one and the same deity, they therefore assigned sundry gods to several creatures." The time arrived, however, when the great idea flashed into the Hebrew mind, <span class="accented">The Powers are One</span> and hence the plural noun, with its subtended conception of unity, became construed with verbs and adjectives in the singular number. It was so construed when applied to the one living God; but it readily retained its original applicability to a plurality of deifies, and hence, in such a passage as the one before us, where there is neither adjective nor verb to indicate the number, the word is quite incapable of exact rendering into English. <span class="cmt_word">Orpah had returned to her people and her Elohim.</span> Return thou after thy sister-in-law. Are we then to suppose that Naomi desired Ruth to return to her Moabitish faith? Is it with a slight degree of criticism that she referred to Orpah's palinode? Would she desire that Ruth should, in this matter, follow in her sister-in-law's wake? We touch on tender topics. Not unlikely she had all along suspected or seen that Orpah would not have insuperable religious scruples. And not unlikely, too, she would herself be free from narrow religious bigotry, at least to the extent of dimly admitting that the true worship of the heart could reach the true God, even when offensive names, and forms, and symbolisms were present in the outer courts of the creed. Nevertheless, when she said to Ruth, "Return thou after thy sister-in-law," she no doubt was rather putting her daughter-in-law to a final test, and leading her to thorough self-sifting, than encouraging her to go back to her ancestral forms of worship. "God," says Fuller, "<span class="accented">wrestled</span> with Jacob with desire to be conquered; so Naomi no doubt opposed Ruth, hoping and wishing that she herself might be foiled." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said Naomi,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
