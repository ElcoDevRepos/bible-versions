This relationship is significant as it highlights the loyalty and devotion Ruth has shown to Naomi, choosing to stay with her even after the death of her husband. Naomi's role as a mother-in-law is pivotal in guiding Ruth through the customs and laws of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;May he be blessed by the LORD,</b><br>Naomi invokes a blessing upon Boaz, recognizing the LORD's providence in their lives. The use of "LORD" refers to Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing the personal relationship and faithfulness of God to His people. This blessing reflects the Hebrew tradition of acknowledging God's hand in acts of kindness and provision.<p><b>who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's ongoing faithfulness and covenant loyalty (hesed) to both the living (Naomi and Ruth) and the dead (Elimelech and his sons). It underscores the belief that God's kindness extends beyond death, maintaining His promises to the family line. This reflects the cultural importance of family legacy and the continuation of one's name in Israelite society.<p><b>Naomi continued, &#8220;The man is a close relative.</b><br>Naomi identifies Boaz as a close relative, which is significant in the context of Israelite family law. The Hebrew term "goel" (kinsman-redeemer) implies a responsibility to protect the interests of needy family members. This relationship sets the stage for Boaz's potential role in redeeming Naomi and Ruth from their destitution.<p><b>He is one of our kinsman-redeemers.&#8221;</b><br>The concept of a kinsman-redeemer is rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a>), where a close relative has the duty to redeem a family member in distress, whether by buying back land, marrying a widow, or avenging blood. Boaz as a kinsman-redeemer is a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus' redemptive work for humanity.

Either way a good sense is obtained. As our lost dear ones had kindness shown them of old, so we too now. If Boaz is the antecedent, it may seem curious that Naomi (knowing that she was dwelling near to a kinsman of her husband's, and, further, one who had shown kindness before they departed to Moab) should not have made herself known to him. It is, at any rate, a proof of the independence of her character. However, the name once named evidently suggests the train of thought which at length leads Naomi to appeal to him for a kinsman's special aid, the aid of the <span class= "ital">Goel </span>or redeemer.<p><span class= "bld">One of our next kinsmen.</span>--One of those who must redeem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed 'of' Yahveh be he who - .</span> The expression is literally, "Blessed 'to' Yahveh be, he who," that is, "Blessed in relation to Yahveh be he who," or "Blessed be he! I carry the desire and prayer up to Yahveh," which just amounts, in meaning, to this: "<span class="accented">Blessed</span> ' by' Yahveh be he who." See other instances of the same construction in <a href="/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19</a>, and <a href="/psalms/115-15.htm">Psalm 115:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Who has not let go his kindness to the living and to the dead.</span> Some take these words to be descriptive of Yahveh. Others take them to be descriptive of Boaz. If they be regarded in the former point of view, then the foregoing clause must be rendered, not, "Blessed by Yahveh be he who," but, "Blessed be he by Yahveh who." Dr. Cassel assumes, but without any formal reasoning or apparent reason, that the reference of the relative is to Yahveh, and hence he makes out an ingenious argument in defense of the doctrine, <span class="accented">that those who are dead to us are yet alive to</span> God - the doctrine of immortality. It is strained. Yet Raabe thinks that the reference is to Yahveh, inasmuch as Naomi had as yet no evidence of Boaz's kindness to the deceased. The reason thus given for carrying the reference up to God is certainly unsatisfactory; for, looking at the subject from the human point of view, it is obvious that Boaz's peculiar kindness to the living was his kindness to the deceased; whereas, if we look at the case from the Divine point of view, it is difficult, if not impossible, to account for the discrimination between the living and the dead. The first feeling that sprang up in the heart of Naomi at the mention of the name of Boaz was one of adoration. The next was a generous desire in reference to Boaz himself. She prayed that he might be graciously recompensed by Yahveh for the kindness he had shown that day, both toward the living - Ruth and herself - and toward the deceased - Elimelech and his sons. A man of less noble nature might have been ready, in reference to relatives in reduced circumstances, to ignore the present, and to bury in oblivion the past. After giving scope to her feelings of adoration and benediction, Naomi, with the prompt and practical directness of a true woman, said to her daughter-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">The man is near to us</span>, adding immediately, and with a rapid glance at bright contingencies that were in the region of the possible, <span class="cmt_word">He is one of our peculiar kinsmen</span> (our <span class="accented">Goelim</span>). She meant that he was one of those peculiarly near kinsmen who had a right of redemption over' whatever lands may have formerly belonged to her, and the first right of purchase over whatever lands might yet remain in the possession of herself or of her daughter-in-law. Naomi and Ruth, though greatly reduced in circumstances, and painfully pent up in present straits, were far from being Paupers. They were proprietors (see <a href="/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3, 5</a>). But their property was not, for the time being, available for income or sustenance. It had either been farmed out on usufruct or allowed to lie waste. In the absence of the <span class="accented">yod</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> we have an instance of <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span>, as distinguished from <span class="accented">scriptio plena</span>. Such defective manuscription might be expected to occur occasionally in transcription from dictation, when, as here, the presence or the absence of the letter made no difference in the pronunciation of the reader. Michaelis, however ('Mosaisches Recht,' &sect; 137), and Gesenius ('Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in voc</span>.), instead of regarding the absence of the <span class="accented">yod</span> as an instance of <span class="accented">scriptio defectiva</span>, have conjectured that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> is a noun, or name, meaning <span class="accented">the seemed in order of the Goelim</span>. But, notwithstanding the ingenuity of the conjecture, there is not a shadow of evidence to evince that the Hebrews themselves ever knew of such a word. Nor does the supposition or subsumption of such a word in the least facilitate the construction on the one hand, or illumine the narrative on the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Naomi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1502;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5281.htm">Strong's 5281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naomi -- mother-in-law of Ruth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
