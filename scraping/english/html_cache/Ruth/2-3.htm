In the cultural context of ancient Israel, widows often faced poverty and marginalization. Ruth's decision to glean reflects the Mosaic Law's provision for the poor, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, which allowed the needy to gather leftover crops. This act of gleaning demonstrates Ruth's humility and determination.<p><b>and gleaned after the harvesters.</b><br>Gleaning was a common practice in ancient Israel, where landowners were instructed to leave the edges of their fields unharvested for the poor and foreigners. Ruth, a Moabite, was both a foreigner and a widow, making her eligible to glean. This practice highlights God's provision for the marginalized and sets the stage for Ruth's encounter with Boaz, a man of standing in the community.<p><b>And she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz,</b><br>The phrase "she happened" suggests a divine orchestration rather than mere coincidence. In the biblical narrative, God's providence is often at work behind the scenes. Boaz's field becomes a place of blessing and protection for Ruth, illustrating how God guides and provides for those who trust in Him. This moment foreshadows the unfolding of God's plan for Ruth and Naomi's redemption.<p><b>who was from the clan of Elimelech.</b><br>Boaz's connection to Elimelech, Naomi's deceased husband, is significant. In the cultural and legal context of Israel, the concept of the kinsman-redeemer (goel) was crucial. A kinsman-redeemer had the responsibility to protect the interests of needy family members, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a>. Boaz's role as a potential redeemer for Ruth and Naomi is a central theme in the book, symbolizing Christ's redemptive work for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who demonstrates loyalty and faithfulness by staying with her mother-in-law, Naomi, and seeking to provide for them both.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential man from Bethlehem, belonging to the clan of Elimelech.

"There are some," says Lawson, "whose virtue and industry lie only in their tongues. They say, and do not. But Ruth was no less diligent in business than wise in resolution." The later Jews had a set of fantastic bylaws concerning gleaning, detailed by Maimonides. One of them was, that if only one or two stalks fell from the sickle or hand of the reaper, these should be left lying for the gleaners; but if <span class="accented">three stalks</span> fell, then the whole of them belonged to the proprietor (see Carpzov's 'Collegium Rabbinico-Biblicum,' p. 242).
