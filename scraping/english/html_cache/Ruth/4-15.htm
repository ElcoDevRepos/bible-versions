In the cultural context of ancient Israel, children were considered a blessing and a source of security for the future, especially in one's old age. The birth of Obed symbolizes hope and redemption for Naomi, who had previously lost her husband and sons. This renewal of life can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers spiritual renewal and sustenance to believers. The idea of renewal and sustenance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, which speaks of those who hope in the Lord renewing their strength.<p><b>For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons,</b><br>Ruth's devotion to Naomi is highlighted here, emphasizing the depth of her love and loyalty. In the cultural context, sons were highly valued for carrying on the family name and providing for their parents. The comparison to "seven sons" underscores Ruth's exceptional worth, as seven is a number often associated with completeness and perfection in the Bible. Ruth's actions reflect the biblical principle of hesed, or loving-kindness, which is a key theme throughout the book. Her loyalty and love are reminiscent of the love Christ shows to His people, as seen in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>, where Jesus speaks of the greatest love being to lay down one's life for friends.<p><b>has given him birth.</b><br>The birth of Obed is significant not only for Naomi and Ruth but also in the broader biblical narrative. Obed becomes the grandfather of King David, placing him in the direct lineage of Jesus Christ, as outlined in <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>. This connection highlights the providential hand of God in orchestrating events for His purposes. The birth of Obed is a fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham's descendants, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>. This event foreshadows the coming of Christ, who would be the ultimate Redeemer and bring spiritual renewal to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>The mother-in-law of Ruth, who experienced great loss but is now being restored through the birth of her grandson.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite woman, Naomi's daughter-in-law, whose loyalty and love for Naomi lead to her becoming the great-grandmother of King David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed.htm">Obed</a></b><br>The son born to Ruth and Boaz, who is seen as a restorer of life and sustainer for Naomi.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A kinsman-redeemer who marries Ruth, ensuring the continuation of Naomi's family line.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The setting of the account, significant as the birthplace of both King David and Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_restoration.htm">God's Restoration</a></b><br>God can renew and restore life even in seemingly hopeless situations.
