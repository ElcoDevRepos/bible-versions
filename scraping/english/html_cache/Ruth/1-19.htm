Bethlehem, meaning "House of Bread," is a town in Judah, known as the future birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ, linking Ruth to the Davidic line. This journey symbolizes a return to God's provision and covenant land, contrasting Moab, often associated with idolatry and judgment. Ruth's commitment to Naomi and her God reflects a profound conversion and loyalty, prefiguring Gentile inclusion in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them,</b><br>The arrival of Naomi and Ruth causes a commotion, indicating Naomi's previous status and the town's small, close-knit nature. The Hebrew word for "stirred" suggests a significant emotional reaction, possibly due to Naomi's changed appearance and circumstances. This scene sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providence and foreshadows the impact Ruth will have on the community and Israel's history. The town's reaction also highlights the cultural importance of community and kinship in ancient Israel.<p><b>and the women of the town exclaimed, &#8220;Can this be Naomi?&#8221;</b><br>The women's question reflects surprise and perhaps pity, as Naomi's return contrasts with her previous departure with a full family. Her name, meaning "pleasant," now seems ironic given her hardships. This moment underscores themes of identity and transformation, as Naomi's experiences have reshaped her life. The women's role in the narrative emphasizes the communal aspect of Israelite society and sets up Naomi's lament in the following verses, where she expresses her bitterness and sense of loss. This exclamation also foreshadows the restoration and redemption that will come through Ruth's actions and God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite woman, widow of Mahlon, who shows loyalty and faithfulness by accompanying her mother-in-law, Naomi, back to Bethlehem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>An Israelite woman who returns to Bethlehem after the death of her husband and sons in Moab.

Earlier they had left Moab because &#8220;the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-6.htm">Ruth 1:6</a>). That faithful provision fuels their perseverance.<p>&#8226; Bethlehem, whose name means &#8220;house of bread,&#8221; had once been emptied by famine (<a href="/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>). Now the very place of former loss is the destination of renewed hope, echoing journeys of faith like Abram&#8217;s in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a> and later Joseph&#8217;s in <a href="/luke/2-4.htm">Luke 2:4</a>.<p>&#8226; The wording reminds us that the Bible treats geography as theology in action&#8212;God bringing His people, step by literal step, back into promised blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When they entered Bethlehem</b><p>&#8226; Arrival matters. <a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a> notes it was &#8220;at the beginning of the barley harvest,&#8221; the season of firstfruits&#8212;hinting that God&#8217;s mercy is blossoming right on time (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Entrance into the town gates marks a threshold moment: Ruth the Moabitess moves from outsider status toward inclusion, foreshadowing <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> where Bethlehem will host the ultimate Redeemer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The whole town was stirred because of them</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew narrative loves understatement; one verse lets us feel the buzz of an entire community. Similar civic ripples echo in <a href="/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13-14</a> and <a href="/matthew/21-10.htm">Matthew 21:10</a>.<p>&#8226; The commotion reveals how deeply famine, death, and exile had scarred Bethlehem. Naomi&#8217;s return re-opens a shared wound&#8212;yet also signals that God might be turning the page.<p>&#8226; God often uses the arrival of needy people to awaken spiritual expectation in those who think they are settled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The women of the town exclaimed, &#8220;Can this be Naomi?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question drips with shock: years and losses have altered her face, just as sorrow marked Job when his friends &#8220;did not recognize him&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>) and as <a href="/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a> foretells of the Suffering Servant.<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s name means &#8220;pleasant,&#8221; but the towns&#173;women glimpse a woman who will soon say, &#8220;Call me Mara&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>). Their gasp sets up the contrast between her perceived emptiness and the fullness God will restore.<p>&#8226; Notice it is the women who voice the town&#8217;s wonder. In Scripture, female witnesses often herald redemptive turning points&#8212;think of the women at Jesus&#8217; tomb (<a href="/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/1-19.htm">Ruth 1:19</a> captures a threshold: two widows walk into Bethlehem at harvest-time, and the community cannot help but react.

Two rivers, Arnon and Jordan, had to be forded or otherwise crossed; and the distance of actual journeying cannot have been less than fifty miles. Thus, weary and travel-stained, they reach Bethlehem, and neighbours, doubtless never looking to see Naomi again, are all astir with excitement. It would seem that though the news of the end of the famine had reached Naomi in Moab, news of her had not reached Bethlehem.<p><span class= "bld">They said . . .</span>--The Bethlehemite women, that is, for the verb is feminine.

It mirrors in language the actual facts of relationship in life. The masculine is some- times assumptively representative of both itself and the feminine. And sometimes, even apart from the representative element, it is the overlapping and overbearing gender. <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they entered Bethlehem, that the whole city got into commotion concerning them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</span> Naomi, though greatly altered in appearance, besides being travel-worn and weary, was recognized. But who was that pensive and beautiful companion by her side? Where was Elimelech? Where was Machne and Chillon? Why are they not with ir mother? Such would be some of the questions started, and keenly talked about and discussed. Then on both the wayfarers the finger-marks of poverty, involuntary signals of distress, would be unconcealable.
