Moabites were often viewed with suspicion due to their historical enmity with Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>). Her inclusion in the narrative underscores the theme of God's grace extending beyond Israel. Ruth's loyalty and faithfulness to Naomi and the God of Israel set her apart, prefiguring the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<p><b>He also told me</b><br>This phrase indicates direct communication and favor from Boaz, a man of standing in Bethlehem. Boaz's actions reflect the character of a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). His kindness foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who communicates God's grace to all people.<p><b>&#8216;Stay with my young men</b><br>Boaz's instruction for Ruth to stay with his young men is a protective measure, ensuring her safety and provision. In the ancient Near Eastern context, gleaning could be dangerous for a woman alone. This protection mirrors God's provision and care for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>.<p><b>until they have finished gathering all my harvest.&#8217;</b><br>The harvest season in Israel, particularly the barley and wheat harvests, was a time of community and celebration. Ruth's continued presence in the fields signifies ongoing provision and blessing. This period of gathering can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual harvest, where God gathers His people (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>). Boaz's generosity and Ruth's diligence during the harvest foreshadow the ultimate gathering of believers through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth_the_moabitess.htm">Ruth the Moabitess</a></b><br>A widow from Moab who showed loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and embraced the God of Israel.

There is apparently no discoverable reason for the re-repetition. It is simply antique particularity, not amenable to any literary law - "the said Moabitess." There is a peculiar abruptness in the initial words of what follows: - <span class="cmt_word">Yea also he said to me.</span> Carpzov and Wright understand them thus: "'Yea' blessed be he, 'for' he said to me." But the word <span class="accented">blessed</span>, as used by Naomi, is too far removed to make it natural for the <span class="accented">yea of</span> Ruth's remark to fall back upon it. Her mind and heart were full. She was profoundly affected by the kindness that had been shown to her. Hence she piles up her representation. "<span class="accented">Also</span>," - <span class="accented">so may I well speak</span>, <span class="accented">-</span> "<span class="accented">for he said to</span> me." <span class="cmt_word">Keep close by my young men, until they have finished all my harvest.</span> The "young men" are not here discriminated from the "young women" (see ver. 8). The idea, consequently, is not that Ruth was to keep close to them in distinction from the young women. It was understood that she should work behind the young women, who followed in the rear of the young men. But it was the express desire of Boaz that, instead of exposing herself among strangers, on any adjoining harvest-fields, she should maintain her position behind his raspers as long as there remained any golden crops to reap. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Ruth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7327.htm">Strong's 7327: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruth -- 'friendship', a Moabite ancestress of David</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Moabitess</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
