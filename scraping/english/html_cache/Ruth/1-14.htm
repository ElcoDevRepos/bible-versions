In the ancient Near Eastern culture, expressions of grief were often public and vocal, reflecting the communal nature of life and relationships. The weeping signifies the pain of separation and the uncertainty of the future, especially for widows in a patriarchal society where their security depended on male relatives.<p><b>and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye</b><br>Orpah's kiss symbolizes a farewell and a return to her Moabite roots. The act of kissing as a form of goodbye is consistent with cultural practices of the time, indicating respect and affection. Orpah's decision to leave Naomi and return to her people and gods (as mentioned in the following verses) reflects a choice to seek security in familiar surroundings, which was a practical decision given the vulnerability of widows.<p><b>but Ruth clung to her</b><br>Ruth's clinging to Naomi is a powerful demonstration of loyalty and commitment, transcending cultural and familial expectations. The Hebrew word used here for "clung" is the same used in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> to describe the bond between husband and wife, indicating a deep, covenantal loyalty. Ruth's decision foreshadows her role in the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus Christ, as her faithfulness leads her to become part of the Messianic line.

Hence the propriety of the singular number, as in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And wept again.</span> The "again" doubles back on the statement in ver. 9. With uplifted voice, in shrill Oriental wail, and amid streams of tears, they bemoaned their hapless lot. Then, after the paroxysm of grief had somewhat spent itself, Orpah yielded to her mother-in-law's dissuasives, and at length imprinted on her, reluctantly and passionately, a farewell kiss. Then, not waiting to ascertain the ultimate decision of Ruth, or rather, perhaps, having now a fixed presentiment what it would be, she moved regretfully and tearfully away. She was afraid, perhaps, that if she, as well as Ruth, should insist on accompanying her mother-in-law, the two might be unreasonably burdensome to the aged widow. Perhaps, too, she was not without fear that her own burden in a foreign land, amid strangers, might be too heavy to be borne. There is not, however, the slightest need for supposing that she was, in any respect, deficient in attachment to her mother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">Ruth clave to her mother-in-law</span>, all reasonings, remonstrances, dissuasives on Naomi's part notwithstanding. Ruth would not be parted from her. "Clave." It is the same word that is used in the primitive law of marriage. "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall <span class="accented">cleave</span> to his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).
