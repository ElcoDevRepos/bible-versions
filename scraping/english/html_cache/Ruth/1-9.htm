The invocation of "the LORD" (Yahweh) signifies a deep trust in the God of Israel, highlighting Naomi's faith even in her grief. The concept of "rest" here is significant, as it implies security, peace, and provision, which were often found in the context of marriage during ancient times. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God providing rest for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a> and <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>, where rest is associated with divine care and provision.<p><b>in the home of your new husband.&#8221;</b><br>The cultural context of this phrase is crucial. In ancient Near Eastern societies, a woman's security and social standing were largely tied to her marital status. Naomi's wish for her daughters-in-law to find new husbands reflects the societal norms of the time, where marriage was a primary means of ensuring a woman's well-being and future. This also foreshadows the eventual marriage of Ruth to Boaz, which not only provides her with rest and security but also plays a critical role in the lineage of King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, as outlined in <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>.<p><b>And she kissed them</b><br>The act of kissing here is a gesture of affection and farewell. It signifies Naomi's deep emotional bond with Orpah and Ruth, despite the cultural and ethnic differences between them. This moment underscores the theme of loyalty and love that permeates the Book of Ruth. Kissing as a form of greeting or parting is a common biblical motif, seen in other passages such as <a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a> and <a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37</a>, symbolizing reconciliation, love, and deep emotional connection.<p><b>as they wept aloud</b><br>The weeping of Naomi, Orpah, and Ruth highlights the intense emotional pain and sorrow of their impending separation. This expression of grief is a natural human response to loss and uncertainty, reflecting the depth of their relationship. The communal aspect of their weeping also emphasizes the shared nature of their suffering and the strong bonds of family and loyalty. This moment of shared grief can be compared to other biblical instances of communal lament, such as in <a href="/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9</a> and <a href="/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33-35</a>, where weeping is a precursor to divine intervention and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem who lost her husband and two sons while living in Moab.

She prays first for the general blessing, that God will show them mercy, and secondly for the special blessing, that they may find rest and peace in a new home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">May Yahveh grant to you that ye may find rest, each in the house of her husband.</span> Naomi again, when the current of her tenderest feelings was running full and strong, lifts up her longing heart toward her own Yahveh. He was the God not of the Hebrews only, but of the Gentiles likewise, and rifled and overruled in Moab. The prayer is, in its form, full of syntactical peculiarity: "May Yahveh give to you," and, as the result of his giving, "may you find rest, each [in] the house of her husband." The expression, "the house of her husband," is used locatively. It is an answer to the suppressed question, "Where are they to find rest?" And hence, in our English idiom, we must insert the preposition, "in the house of her husband." As to the substance of the prayer, it has, as truly as the grammatical syntax, its own tinge of Orientalism. Young females in Moab had but little scope for a life of usefulness and happiness, unless shielded round and round within the home of a pure and devoted husband. Naomi was well aware of this, and hence, in her motherly solicitude for her virtuous daughters-in-law, she gave them to understand that it would be the opposite of a grief to her if they should seek, in the one way open to them in that comparatively undeveloped state of society, to brighten the homes of the lonely. In such homes, it circumstances were propitious, they would find deliverance from unrest and anxiety. They would find <span class="accented">rest</span>. It would be a position in which they could <span class="accented">abide</span>, and in which their tenderest feelings and most honorable desires would find satisfaction and <span class="accented">repose</span>. The peculiar force of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is finely displayed by the texture of the associated expressions in <a href="/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17, 18</a>: "<span class="accented">And</span> the work of righteousness shall be <span class="accented">peace</span>; and the effect of righteousness <span class="accented">quietness</span> and <span class="accented">assurance forever</span>; and my people shall dwell in <span class="accented">a peaceable habitation</span>, and in <span class="accented">sure dwellings</span>, and in <span class="accented">quiet resting-places"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And she kissed them,</span> locking them lingeringly and lovingly in a farewell embrace. "<span class="accented">Kissed</span> them." The preposition <span class="accented">to</span>, according to the customary Hebrew idiom, <span class="accented">stands</span> before the pronoun. In kissing, Naomi imparted herself passionately <span class="accented">to</span> her beloved daughters-in-law, and clung <span class="accented">to</span> them. There would be full-hearted reciprocation, and each to each would cling "in their embracement, as they grew together" (Shakespeare, <span class="accented">Henry VIII</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And they lifted up their voice and wept.</span> The idea is not that all three wept aloud. The pronoun "they" refers to the daughters-in-law, as is evident both from the preceding and from the succeeding context. The fine idiomatic version of the Vulgate brings out successfully and unambiguously the true state of the <span class="accented">case - quae elevata voce flere coeperunt</span>. The <span class="accented">lifting</span>, <span class="accented">up of the voice</span> in weeping must be thought of according to the measure of Oriental, as distinguished from Occidental, custom. In the East there is less self-restraint in this matter than in the West. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">May the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">enable</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">each of you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1462;&#1443;&#1488;&#1503;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7779;e&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
