This reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where the community shared in both the sorrows and joys of its members. The women serve as a chorus, affirming God's providence and the restoration of Naomi's fortunes.<p><b>Blessed be the LORD</b><br>This phrase is a doxology, a short hymn of praises to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and goodness. It reflects the belief that all good things come from God and that He is actively involved in the lives of His people. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting His faithfulness.<p><b>who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer</b><br>The concept of a kinsman-redeemer (Hebrew: go'el) is central to the book of Ruth. It refers to a close relative who has the responsibility to redeem a family member in distress, whether by buying back land, marrying a widow, or avenging blood. Boaz fulfills this role for Naomi and Ruth, symbolizing God's provision and care. This also foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate Redeemer for humanity.<p><b>May his name become famous in Israel</b><br>This blessing speaks to the hope that the child born to Ruth and Boaz, Obed, will have a lasting legacy. It underscores the importance of family lineage and heritage in Israelite culture. Obed becomes the grandfather of King David, linking this narrative to the Davidic line and ultimately to Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecies and establishing a royal lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Ruth, Naomi is a widow who returns to Bethlehem from Moab after the death of her husband and sons.

May his name become famous in Israel.</span> Of course it is Ruth's son who is the kinsman referred to, the nearest kinsman, still nearer than Boaz. The kinsman was given, said the women, "this day," the day when the child was born. The expression which we have rendered, "who has given thee a kinsman," is, literally, "who has not caused to fail to thee a kinsman." The sympathetic women who had gathered together in Boaz's house were sanguine, or at least enthusiastically desirous, that a son so auspiciously given, after most peculiar antecedents, would yet become a famous name in Israel. Canon Cook supposes that the kinsman referred to by the women was not the child, but his father, Boaz ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loc</span>.). Yet it is obvious that the kinsman specified was the one who, as they said, had been given, or had not been caused to fail, "that day." He was, moreover, the one of whom they went on to say, "May his name become famous in Israel, and may he be to thee a restorer of life, and for the support of thine old age," etc. Dr. <span class="accented">Cook's</span> objections are founded on a too narrow view of the functions devolving on, and of the privileges accruing to, a <span class="accented">goel</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the women</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
