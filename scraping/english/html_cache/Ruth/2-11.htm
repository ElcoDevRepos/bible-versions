This reflects the cultural importance of family loyalty and the care for widows, which is emphasized in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>). Ruth's actions demonstrate the biblical principle of hesed, or loving-kindness, which is a key theme throughout the book.<p><b>how you left your father and mother and the land of your birth</b><br>Ruth's decision to leave her family and homeland, Moab, mirrors the call of Abraham, who left his country and family to follow God's promise (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). This act of faith and commitment is significant, as it shows Ruth's willingness to embrace a new identity and future with the people of Israel.<p><b>and how you came to a people you did not know before</b><br>Ruth's journey to Bethlehem represents a step of faith into the unknown, much like the journey of faith every believer is called to undertake. Her integration into the Israelite community prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).

His acknowledgment assures us that the Lord sees every hidden act of faith and honors those who seek refuge in Him. <a href="/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a> therefore celebrates providence rewarding covenant loyalty, encouraging believers to walk the same path of sacrificial, observable faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Heretofore.</span>--The curious Hebrew phrase thus rendered is literally, <span class= "ital">yesterday and the day before.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Boaz's interest and admiration grew. <span class="cmt_word">And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully showed to me, all that thou hast done toward thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband: and that thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and hast come to a people whom heretofore thou knewest not.</span> When Boaz says, "It has been fully showed to me," he probably refers to the information which he had received from his overseer. The expression rendered "fully showed" is a fine specimen of a very antique idiom, <span class="accented">showed-showed</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>). "Toward thy mother-in-law." The preposition which we render "toward" is literally "with," which, indeed, when laid side by side with the Hebrew preposition, looks as if it were organically identical. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> = <span class="accented">eth</span>. Compare the old Hebrew <span class="accented">etha</span> with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">itah</span>. See Raabe's 'Glossar'). The expression which we render "heretofore" is literally "yesterday and the day before," a very primitive way of representing <span class="accented">time past</span>. It must have been like balm to the anxious heart of Ruth to hear from the lips of such a man as Boaz so hearty a "well-done." "Ruth," says the venerable Lawson, "showed no disposition to praise herself. She did not claim a right to glean from what she had done for Naomi, but wondered that such kindness should be showed by Boaz to her who was a stranger, and she hears the voice of praise from the mouth of one whoso commendations were a very great honor. No saying was oftener in the mouth of Jesus than this, <span class="accented">He that exalteth himself shall be abased</span>, <span class="accented">and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Boaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#8216;az)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1162.htm">Strong's 1162: </a> </span><span class="str2">Boaz -- 'quickness', an ancestor of David, also a pillar before the temple</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
