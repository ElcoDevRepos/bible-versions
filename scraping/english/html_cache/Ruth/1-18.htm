Her daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth, were Moabite women. The cultural context here is significant; Moabites and Israelites had a history of tension, and Ruth's determination to leave her homeland and follow Naomi is a profound act of loyalty and faith. This determination can be seen as a reflection of God's covenant faithfulness, as Ruth's commitment mirrors the steadfast love God shows to His people. Ruth's decision also foreshadows her role in the lineage of David and ultimately Jesus Christ, highlighting the inclusion of Gentiles in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>she stopped trying to persuade her</b><br>Naomi's initial attempts to persuade Ruth to stay in Moab were rooted in practical concerns for Ruth's future security and prospects for remarriage. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, a widow's survival often depended on her family connections, and Naomi had no more sons to offer as husbands. Naomi's cessation of persuasion indicates her recognition of Ruth's unwavering commitment. This moment underscores the theme of divine providence, as Ruth's choice to stay with Naomi leads to her becoming an ancestor of King David and, by extension, Jesus Christ. Naomi's acceptance of Ruth's decision also marks a turning point in the narrative, setting the stage for the unfolding of God's plan through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite woman, widow of Mahlon, who demonstrates loyalty and faithfulness to her mother-in-law, Naomi.

The verse begins with her seeing, not merely hearing. Scripture often shows God&#8217;s people paying attention before acting (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithful discernment&#8212;recognizing what God is doing in another&#8217;s life&#8212;protects against rash words or needless pressure (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Naomi&#8217;s grief could have clouded her judgment, yet she notices genuine devotion in Ruth, reminding us that God can sharpen our spiritual sight even in sorrow (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Ruth was determined</b><p>&#8226; Determination here is no passing emotion; it mirrors the steadfastness God desires (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Daniel who &#8220;resolved that he would not defile himself&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), Ruth sets her will. God honors such firm decisions (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Single-minded commitment contrasts with double-minded wavering (<a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6&#8211;8</a>). Ruth&#8217;s resolve points forward to Christ &#8220;determined to go to Jerusalem&#8221; for our redemption (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>&#8226; True covenant love expresses itself in decisive action, not vague intentions (<a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to go with her</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;With&#8221; underscores relationship.

Ruth&#8217;s presence will later be Naomi&#8217;s answer to loneliness and loss (<a href="/ruth/4-15.htm">Ruth 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedient companionship often precedes unforeseen blessing; Ruth&#8217;s journey will position her in Bethlehem, paving the way for Boaz, Obed, and ultimately David (<a href="/ruth/4-17.htm">Ruth 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she stopped trying to persuade her</b><p>&#8226; Naomi recognizes that continued urging would oppose what God is forming in Ruth.
