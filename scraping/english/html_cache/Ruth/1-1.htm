The period of the judges was a time of social and religious upheaval in Israel, characterized by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. This era is detailed in the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly turned away from God, leading to periods of foreign domination. The judges were leaders raised by God to deliver Israel from its oppressors. This time was marked by moral relativism and a lack of centralized leadership, as noted in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>, "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes."<p><b>there was a famine in the land</b><br>Famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East and often signified divine displeasure or a test of faith. In the context of Israel, a famine could be seen as a consequence of the nation's disobedience to God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-24</a>, where God warns of drought and famine as a result of turning away from His commandments. This famine sets the stage for the narrative, prompting the movement of the family from Bethlehem to Moab.<p><b>And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah</b><br>Bethlehem, meaning "house of bread," is ironically the setting of a famine. It is a small town in Judah, significant in biblical history as the birthplace of King David and later, Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>). The mention of Judah highlights the tribal affiliation, emphasizing the family's connection to the lineage of David, which is central to the messianic prophecy.<p><b>with his wife and two sons</b><br>The family unit is central to the narrative, highlighting themes of loyalty, kinship, and survival. The mention of the wife and sons sets up the personal and familial challenges that will unfold. The family structure also reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where lineage and inheritance were passed through male descendants.<p><b>went to reside in the land of Moab</b><br>Moab was located east of the Dead Sea and was often in conflict with Israel. The Moabites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>) and had a complicated relationship with the Israelites, sometimes hostile, as seen in <a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-30</a>. The decision to move to Moab indicates the severity of the famine and the desperation of the family. Moab's inclusion in the narrative foreshadows the integration of Ruth, a Moabite, into the Israelite community, which is significant for the genealogy of David and ultimately, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>This period refers to the time in Israel's history when judges led the people, a time marked by cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food that affected the land of Israel, prompting the movement of people in search of sustenance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>A town in Judah, known as the future birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ.

The "And" is somewhat remarkable, standing at the commencement of the Book. But as it is also found at the commencement of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Ezekiel, Esther, and Ezra, its use, though inartistic, must be amenable to some literary law. The Books specified, even including Ezekiel, are historical They are parcels of history, each narrating events that had their genesis in more or less significant antecedent occurrences. This historical genesis, so very different from an "absolute commencement" of things, is indicated, though probably in unreflective spontaneity, by the copulative "And." <span class="cmt_word">In the days when the judges ruled.</span> Or, more literally, "when the judges judged." In primitive times there was no function that was more important for society than that of judiciously settling disputes between man and man. Every such settlement, besides conferring a benefit on society, and in particular on the individuals at variance, would increase the moral influence and social elevation of the judge. By and by his moral and social superiority would, in favorable circumstances, grow into authority, specifically judicial on the one hand, and generically political, or semi-political, on the other. When military prowess and skill in strategy were added, a ruler, champion, or leader would be the result. Many such leaders rose up among the Hebrews ere yet society was compactly organized. They were vanously endowed; but most of them were only very partially equipped for the judicious administration of the affairs of the commonwealth. All, however, were called <span class="accented">judges</span>; and the discharge of their high duties was denominated <span class="accented">judging</span>, even when it was entirely inconspicuous as regards judicial ability or judicious determinations. The Hebrew word for <span class="accented">judge</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;</span> <span class="accented">shofet</span>; and it is an interesting evidence of the very close kinship of Hebrew and Phoenician, that in Carthage the chief magistrate, as we learn from Livy and other Roman writers, was called <span class="accented">sufes</span> (originally, as we see from the inflection, <span class="accented">sufet</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That there was a famine.</span> An admirable though free rendering. In the original the structure of the whole statement is exceedingly primitive and "agglutinative" - <span class="accented">And</span> (<span class="accented">it</span>) <span class="accented">was in the days of the judging of the judges</span>, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">there</span>) <span class="accented">was a famine</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In the land.</span> Namely, of Israel. The non-specification of the particular country referred to is evidence that the writer was living in it, as one at home. Josephus says that it was under the judgeship of Eli, the high priest, that the famine spoken of occurred ('Antiquities,' 5:9, 1). But here the historian speaks "without book," and without any particular plausibility. Several expositors, such as Bishop Patrick, have antedated, by a very long way, the calculation of Josephus They would assign the famine to the period when the Midianites and Amalekites came up, "as grasshoppers for multitude, to destroy the land," so that Israel was greatly impoverished (see <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>.). But it is in vain to multiply guesses. The date of the famine is not given, and it is futile to make inquisition for it. <span class="cmt_word">And a certain man.</span> The interpolation of the individualizing word "<span class="accented">certain"</span> is quite uncalled for, and now quite archaic. The simplicity of the original is sufficient, "And a man. <span class="cmt_word">Of Bethlehem</span>-<span class="cmt_word">judah.</span> Or, as it might be still more literally represented, "of Bethlehem, Judah." Them is no such single name as Bethlehem-judah. There is only the apposition, for discrimination's sake, of one geographical name to another, just as we may say, in English, <span class="accented">Boston</span>, <span class="accented">Lincolnshire</span>, or <span class="accented">Alexandria</span>, <span class="accented">Dumbartonshire</span>. The localization of the main name is thus effectually indicated. There is another Alexandria in Egypt; there is another Boston in the United States of America; and there was in Palestine another Bethlehem, namely, in the canton of Zebulun (see <a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). Bethlehem, Judah, lies about six miles to the south of Jerusalem. "Its appearance," says Dr. Porter, "is striking. It is situated on a narrow ridge, which projects eastward from the central mountain range, and breaks down in abrupt terraced slopes to deep valleys on the north, east, and south. The terraces, admirably kept, and covered with rows of olives, intermixed with the fig and the vine, sweep in graceful curves round the ridge, regular as stairs" ('Syria and Palestine,' D. 199). The valleys below are exceptionally fertile, and have been so from time immemorial. Hence indeed the name <span class="accented">Beth-lehem</span>, or <span class="accented">Bread-house</span>. Its modern name is <span class="accented">Beit-lahm</span>, or <span class="accented">Flesh-house</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Went to sojourn in the land of Moab.</span> We have no word in English that exactly, corresponds to the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> rendered <span class="accented">sojourn</span>. The cognate noun is uniformly translated, in King James's version, <span class="accented">stranger</span>, and means <span class="accented">foreigner</span>. The verb means <span class="accented">to dwell as a foreigner</span>, but its root-idea is yet undetermined. The Latin <span class="accented">peregrinari</span> admirably corresponds. The man of Bethlehem, Judah, went forth from his own country to "peregrinate" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) "in the land of Moab;" literally, "in the fields of Moab," that is, "in the pastoral parts of the territory of Moab." It was not a very great way off, this land of his "peregrination." Its blue mountains, rising up luridly beyond the silver thread of the Jordan and the gleaming expanse of the Dead Sea, are distinctly visible from the Mount of Olives and the heights about Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">He, and his wife, and his two sons.</span> The resumptive he is employed for the purpose of linking on to him, in his "peregrination, the other members of the little household. He emigrated "along with his wife and two sons." He had fought hard to keep the wolf of hunger from his door, but was like to be beaten. One after another the props of his hope that better days would soon dawn had been swept from under him, and he saw no alternative but to leave for a season the land of his fathers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
