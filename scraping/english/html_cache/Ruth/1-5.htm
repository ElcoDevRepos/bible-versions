Their names, which mean "sickness" and "wasting" respectively, may foreshadow their untimely deaths. This event occurs in Moab, a land often at odds with Israel, highlighting the peril of leaving the Promised Land during a time of famine. Theologically, their deaths can be seen as a divine judgment or a consequence of leaving Bethlehem, the "house of bread," for a foreign land. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of faithfulness to God&#8217;s covenant.<p><b>and Naomi was left without her two sons</b><br>Naomi's loss of her sons is a profound personal tragedy and a social crisis. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sons were vital for the continuation of a family line and for providing for their parents in old age. This loss leaves Naomi vulnerable and without support, emphasizing the precarious position of widows in biblical times. Theologically, this sets the stage for God's redemptive work through Ruth, Naomi's daughter-in-law, who will later become an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ. This reflects the biblical theme of God bringing hope and restoration out of despair.<p><b>and without her husband</b><br>The death of Elimelech, Naomi's husband, compounds her grief and vulnerability. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, a husband was the primary provider and protector. Elimelech's death leaves Naomi without male protection or provision, underscoring her dire situation. This loss also signifies the end of Elimelech's lineage unless a kinsman-redeemer steps in, a concept that will become central later in the story. This foreshadows the role of Boaz as a type of Christ, who redeems and restores what was lost, pointing to the ultimate redemption found in Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Ruth, Naomi is a widow who loses her two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, in the land of Moab.

But why "cudgelled?" There is no evidence in the text of Divine displeasure, and the Christian expositor, when going beyond the text in quest of principles, should not forget the tower of Siloam, and the victims of Pilate s bloodthirstiness (see <a href="/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</span> That is, "of her two children as well as of her husband."

If all sentiment were to be taken out of the expression, it might then be simply said, in very commonplace prose, <span class="accented">she survived them</span>. Poor woman! "Of the two sexes," says Fuller, "the woman is the weaker; of women, old women are most feeble; of old women, widows most woeful; of widows, those that are poor, their plight most pitiful; of poor widows, those who want children, their case most doleful; of widows that want children, those that once had them, and after lost them, their estate most desolate; of widows that have had children, those that are strangers in a foreign country, their condition most comfortless. Yet all these met together in Naomi, as in the center of sorrow, to make the measure of her misery pressed down, shaken together, running over. I conclude, therefore, many men have had affliction - none like Job; many women have had tribulation - none like Naomi." <p> CHAPTER 1:6-14. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">both</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc &#124;
