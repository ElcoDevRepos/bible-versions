This role was crucial in maintaining the family lineage and property within the tribe. Boaz acknowledges his position as a kinsman-redeemer, which highlights his willingness to fulfill this duty. This concept is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Redeemer for humanity, purchasing us with His sacrifice (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>).<p><b>but there is a redeemer nearer than I</b><br>Boaz demonstrates integrity and adherence to the law by acknowledging the presence of a closer relative who has the first right to redeem. This reflects the importance of following God's established order and respecting family rights. The mention of a nearer redeemer introduces a tension in the narrative, emphasizing the legal and cultural procedures of the time. It also foreshadows the resolution of Ruth's situation, as Boaz's actions align with God's providential plan. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His redemptive purposes, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and has come to Bethlehem to seek refuge and provision.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy and influential relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.

Thus God&#8217;s providence works through both human freedom and legal structures (<a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, Christ became our nearest possible kin by taking on flesh (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>), fulfilling all righteous requirements on our behalf (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/3-12.htm">Ruth 3:12</a> presents Boaz as an honest, eager, yet law-abiding kinsman-redeemer. His respectful acknowledgment of a closer relative models integrity and patience, while his readiness foreshadows Christ&#8217;s perfect redemption. The verse assures us that God&#8217;s rescue operates within His righteous order, guaranteeing both justice and steadfast love for all who seek shelter under His wings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now it is the case of a truth that while I am a kinsman, there is yet a kinsman nearer than I.</span> Or the rendering might with greater brevity be given thus: <span class="cmt_word">And now of a truth I am a kinsman; and yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span> The survivals of a very ancient style of elaborately-detailed composition are here preserved. The archaism, however, was not quite appreciated by the Mazorites, who, in accordance with the spirit of the age in which they flourished, took but little note of the philological development, historical and prehistorical, of the language they were handling. Hence they suppressed the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> in K'ri, though faithfully preserving it in C'tib. The particles, standing up and semi-isolated, palaeolithic-wise, might be accounted for in some such way as is shown in the following paraphrase: "<span class="accented">And now</span> (I declare) 'that' <span class="accented">of a truth</span> (it is the <span class="accented">case</span>) '<span class="accented">that if</span> (I declare the whole truth) I (am) <span class="accented">a kinsman</span>, <span class="accented">and also there is a kinsman nearer than I</span>." Boas was of that strictly honorable cast of mind that he could not for a moment entertain any project that might amount to a disregard of the rights of others, even although these rights should fly violently in the teeth own personal desires. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is true</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_551.htm">Strong's 551: </a> </span><span class="str2">Verily, truly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
