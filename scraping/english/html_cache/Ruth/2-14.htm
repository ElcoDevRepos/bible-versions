Mealtime was a communal event, and inviting Ruth, a Moabite and a gleaner, to join was an act of inclusion and grace. This reflects the biblical principle of hospitality and care for the foreigner and the needy, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Come over here;</b><br>Boaz's invitation is personal and direct, showing his willingness to break social norms. In ancient Israel, social barriers often separated landowners from the poor and foreigners. Boaz's actions prefigure the inclusive nature of Christ's ministry, where He often reached out to those marginalized by society.<p><b>have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.&#8221;</b><br>Bread was a staple food, symbolizing sustenance and life. The vinegar sauce, likely a sour wine or vinegar mixture, was used for flavor.

Boaz personally offering it to Ruth demonstrates his care and provision, akin to how God provides for His people. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers Himself as the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and she ate and was satisfied</b><br>Ruth's satisfaction from the meal symbolizes God's provision and abundance. It reflects the biblical theme of God satisfying the needs of His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>. This satisfaction also points to the spiritual fulfillment found in Christ.<p><b>and had some left over.</b><br>The abundance of food, with leftovers, signifies God's overflowing provision. This mirrors the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000, where Jesus provided more than enough for the crowd, with baskets of leftovers (<a href="/john/6-12.htm">John 6:12-13</a>).

Similar to this was the vinegar of the Gospel narrative, a sour wine generally mixed with water, which was offered to our Saviour (<a href="/matthew/27-48.htm" title="And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.">Matthew 27:48</a>, &c.).<p><span class= "bld">Left.</span>--Had to spare.

But it is evidently to be taken, in accordance with the Masoretic punctuation, as the historical statement of the narrator: "At meal-time, Boaz said, <span class="accented">Come along hither</span>." At meal-time Boaz rejoined Ruth, and said to her, "Come along hither." Then they would walk along in company, till they reached the siesta-hut, ' <span class="cmt_word">And eat of the bread, that is going, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar</span>, or the <span class="accented">sour wine</span> that was quite a favorite beverage with out-door workers. It had a peculiarly cooling and refreshing effect. It corresponded to the posed used by the Roman soldiery, and would, according to circumstances and individual taste, be taken either "neat" or diluted with water. <span class="cmt_word">And she sat by the side of the reapers.</span> Probably along with the other young women, although the refer-once to them is accidentally overlapped by the specification of the male workers. <span class="cmt_word">And he prepared for her a bunch of parched corn</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> is only conjecturally rendered "reached" in King James's version, and by many other translators. The rendering is given under the leadership of the Chaldee Paraphrast, who explains the word by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span>, which is a pure Chaldee word for "reached." But light is thrown on the old Hebrew word by both Arabic and Sanscrit cognates, as well as by the Septuagint version (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). It meant <span class="accented">to bind into a bunch</span> or <span class="accented">bunches</span> (see Furst and Raabe). The word is illustrated by modern Oriental usage. Dr. W. M. Thomson says, "Harvest is the time for parched corn. It is made thus: - A quantity of the best ears, not too ripe, are plucked with the stalks attached. These are tied into small parcels; a blazing fire is kindled with dry grass and thorn bushes, and the corn-heads are held in it until the chaff is mostly burnt off. The grain is thus sufficiently roasted to be eaten, and it is a favorite article all over the country" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 648). Mr. Legh, in like manner, states, in MacMichael's Journey, 1819, that, traveling in harvest-time in the country cast of the Dead Sea, they one day rested near some cornfields, "where one of the Arabs, having plucked some green ears of corn, parched them for us by putting them into the fire, and then, when roasted, rubbing out the grain in his hands" (Kitto's 'Pictorial Bible,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). Sometimes, however, the parched corn is otherwise prepared. Dr. Robinson says, "<span class="accented">In</span> one field, as we approached Kubeibeh, nearly 200 reapers and gleaners were at work; the latter being nearly as numerous as the former. A few were taking their refreshment, and offered us some of their 'parched corn.' In the season of harvest the grains of wheat, not yet fully dry and hard, are roasted in a pan or on an iron plate, and constitute a very palatable article of food. This is eaten with bread, or instead of it. Indeed, the use of it is so common at this time among the laboring classes, that this parched wheat is sold in the markets; and it was among our list of articles to be purchased at Hebron for our journey to Wady Musa. The Arabs, it was said, prefer it to rice; but this we did not find to be the case. The whole scene of the reapers and gleaners, and their 'parched <span class="accented">corn</span>,' gave us a lively representation of the story of Ruth and the ancient harvest-time in the fields of Boaz" ('Biblical Researches,' vol. 2. p. 394, ed. 1841). Boaz had given Ruth a kind of Benjamin's portion of parched corn. She could not use it all. <span class="cmt_word">And she ate, and was satisfied, and left over.</span> Carefully reserving, however, and "basketing up" the liberal surplus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At mealtime</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
