The term "my daughter" indicates a familial and respectful relationship, highlighting the cultural norms of addressing younger women with care and respect. It also reflects Boaz's role as a kinsman-redeemer, a concept rooted in Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), where a close relative is responsible for protecting the interests of family members in need.<p><b>I will do for you whatever you request,</b><br>Boaz's willingness to fulfill Ruth's request demonstrates his integrity and commitment to the law of levirate marriage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of redemption and foreshadows the ultimate redemption found in Christ, who fulfills the law and offers grace. Boaz's actions are a type of Christ, who willingly redeems those who come to Him in faith.<p><b>since all my fellow townspeople know</b><br>This indicates the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where personal reputations were well-known and significant. The mention of "fellow townspeople" suggests that Ruth's actions and character have been observed and discussed within the community, reflecting the importance of communal relationships and accountability in biblical times.<p><b>that you are a woman of noble character.</b><br>Ruth's reputation as a "woman of noble character" aligns with the description of the virtuous woman in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>. This phrase highlights her loyalty, hard work, and moral integrity, which have earned her respect and admiration.

Everything in Ruth&#8217;s journey&#8212;her loyalty to Naomi, her hours gleaning in the fields, her midnight venture to the threshing floor&#8212;has led to this point of resolution. Scripture often highlights such turning points: &#8220;Behold, now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>). God&#8217;s providence moves from preparation to action in real time, underscoring that His plans unfold within concrete moments of history rather than vague ideals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not be afraid</b><p>Boaz immediately calms Ruth&#8217;s heart. Fear could have flooded her mind: fear of rejection, fear of public shame, fear for her future. Yet the kinsman-redeemer tells her what the Lord so often tells His people: &#8220;Do not fear, for I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Joshua heard the same encouragement before entering the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), and believers today rest in it when facing uncertainty (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>). Boaz mirrors God&#8217;s own shepherd-like reassurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My daughter</b><p>The term reflects tenderness and protective responsibility. Ruth, a Moabitess and a widow, needed both. Boaz treats her with the familial honor prescribed in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a> (&#8220;treat younger women as sisters, with absolute purity&#8221;) and models the compassion &#8220;as a father has compassion on his children&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). The words affirm Ruth&#8217;s belonging within God&#8217;s covenant community despite her foreign birth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will do for you whatever you request</b><p>Boaz pledges full cooperation with Ruth&#8217;s plea for redemption and marriage. His readiness echoes God&#8217;s own willingness to answer the cries of His people: &#8220;Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>). Under the law of the kinsman-redeemer (<a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>), Boaz is prepared to act sacrificially and legally on Ruth&#8217;s behalf. The promise foreshadows Christ, who not only can redeem but delights to redeem (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character</b><p>Ruth&#8217;s reputation precedes her. From Moab to Bethlehem, her consistent faithfulness has become public knowledge. <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a> praises &#8220;a wife of noble character,&#8221; and Ruth embodies that ideal:<p>&#8226; Loyalty: She clung to Naomi when Orpah turned back (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Humility: She called herself a servant while gleaning (<a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Industry: She worked &#8220;from early morning until now&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-7.htm">Ruth 2:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Modesty: Her nighttime approach was pure, not provocative, relying on Boaz&#8217;s honor.<p>The community&#8217;s affirmation fulfills <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>&#8212;&#8220;Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven&#8221;. Ruth&#8217;s quiet integrity becomes a testimony that validates Boaz&#8217;s forthcoming action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a> captures the pivotal pledge of a faithful man to a virtuous woman under God&#8217;s providence. Boaz moves from reassurance to commitment, grounded in Ruth&#8217;s proven character and witnessed by the community. The verse showcases fearless trust, familial compassion, willing redemption, and public virtue&#8212;elements that anticipate the greater Redeemer who answers every plea with steadfast love and perfect faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ruth/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">City.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">gate: </span>the constant meeting-place of persons going in and out.

But every side of its import brings into view one or other or more of such affiliated ideas as <span class="accented">strength</span>, <span class="accented">force</span>, <span class="accented">forces</span>, <span class="accented">capability</span> - whether mental and moral only, or also financial; <span class="accented">competency</span>, <span class="accented">substantiality</span>, <span class="accented">ability</span>, <span class="accented">bravery</span>. All who had taken notice of Ruth perceived that she was mentally and morally, as well as physically, a <span class="accented">substantial</span> and <span class="accented">capable</span> woman. She was possessed of <span class="accented">force</span>, both of mind and character. She was, in the New England sense, of the expression, <span class="accented">a woman</span> of "faculty. She was <span class="accented">full of resources</span>, and thus adequate to the position which, as Boaz's wife, she would be required to fill. There was no levity about her, "no nonsense." She was earnest, industrious, virtuous, strenuous, brave. There was much of <span class="accented">the heroine in</span> her character, and thus the expression connects itself with the masculine application of the distinctive and many-sided word, "<span class="accented">a</span> mighty man of <span class="accented">valor</span>." The expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> occurs in <a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>, where, in King James's version, it is, as here and in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>, translated 'Ca virtuous woman" - "a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband." But it is not so much to moral <span class="accented">virtue</span> that there is a reference as to that general capacity which consists in "<span class="accented">large</span> discourse, looking before and after" ('Hamlet, ' 4:4). Compare the masculine expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> in <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21, 25</a>, rendered, in King-James's version, "able men," and meaning <span class="accented">capable</span> or <span class="accented">substantial men</span>, who, however, as we learn from the additional characteristics that are specified, were to be likewise conspicuous for high moral worth. In <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a> there is the same reference to <span class="accented">general capacity</span>, as is evidenced by the graphic representation that follows - a representation that by no means exhausts itself in the idea of <span class="accented">moral virtue</span>. Ibn Ezra takes the whole soul out of the expression when he interprets it, both here and in Proverbs, as meaning "<span class="accented">a</span> woman possessed of riches." When Boaz says, "All that thou sayest I will do to thee," he means, "All that thou hast so winsomely and yet so modestly referred to in what thou didst say, I am prepared to do to thee. There was only one obstacle in the way, and that of a somewhat technical description. If that should be honorably surmounted, nothing would be more agreeable to Boaz s heart than to get nearer to Ruth "For," said he, "it is on all hands known in the gate of my people that," etc. Literally the phrase is, "for all the gate of my people know," a strange inverted but picturesque mode of expression. It was not "the gate of the people," but the people of the gate," that knew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/3-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
