This reflects the familial bond and loyalty that Ruth has shown by staying with Naomi. The term "wait" suggests patience and trust in God's timing, a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, which encourages believers to wait on the Lord.<p><b>until you find out how things go,</b><br>This phrase indicates anticipation and uncertainty about the outcome of Ruth's proposal to Boaz. It reflects the cultural practice of seeking a kinsman-redeemer, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25-55</a>, where a relative could redeem a family member in distress. The outcome is uncertain, but there is hope in the process.<p><b>for he will not rest</b><br>Boaz is portrayed as a man of action and integrity, committed to resolving the situation. This mirrors the character of God, who is depicted as a redeemer who does not rest until His purposes are fulfilled, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/62.htm">Isaiah 62:1</a>. Boaz's diligence foreshadows Christ's redemptive work, who also did not rest until He accomplished salvation.<p><b>unless he has resolved the matter today.</b><br>The urgency in Boaz's actions reflects the cultural importance of resolving legal and familial obligations promptly. This resolution is crucial for Ruth and Naomi's future security. The immediacy also points to the certainty of God's promises, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>, where all promises find their "Yes" in Christ.
