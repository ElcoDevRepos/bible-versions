In ancient Israel, the harvest was a time of joy and thanksgiving to God for His provision. The mention of Boaz being in "good spirits" suggests a relaxed and positive mood, which sets the stage for the events that follow. This context is important as it shows Boaz's readiness to receive Ruth's request with kindness. The cultural practice of sharing meals and drinks after a hard day's work was common, fostering community and gratitude.<p><b>he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain</b><br>Boaz lying down at the end of the heap of grain indicates his role as the owner and protector of the harvest. It was customary for landowners to sleep near their grain to guard against theft. This setting also highlights the abundance of the harvest, a sign of God's blessing. The location at the threshing floor is significant, as it was a place of separation and preparation, symbolizing the potential for new beginnings and transformation.<p><b>Then Ruth went in secretly</b><br>Ruth's secretive approach underscores the delicacy and risk of her actions. In the cultural context, a woman approaching a man at night could be misinterpreted, yet Ruth's intentions are pure and guided by Naomi's instructions. Her discreet manner reflects her humility and respect for Boaz, as well as her understanding of the social norms of the time. This act of courage and faith is pivotal in the unfolding of God's plan for her and Boaz.<p><b>uncovered his feet, and lay down</b><br>Uncovering Boaz's feet was a symbolic gesture of submission and a request for protection. In the cultural and historical context, this act was a non-verbal proposal for marriage, invoking the role of the kinsman-redeemer. By lying down at his feet, Ruth was expressing her willingness to be under Boaz's care and protection, aligning with the Levirate marriage customs found in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>. This act foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who covers and redeems those who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/boaz.htm">Boaz</a></b><br>A wealthy landowner in Bethlehem, a relative of Naomi's deceased husband, Elimelech.
