"Full" signifies not only material wealth but also the presence of her family&#8212;her husband and two sons. This phrase highlights the initial hope and prosperity she felt, contrasting with her current state. The move to Moab, a land often at odds with Israel, was a significant decision, showing the desperation of the times (<a href="/ruth/1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>). The fullness she refers to is both physical and relational, emphasizing the loss she has experienced.<p><b>but the LORD has brought me back empty</b><br>Naomi attributes her return to the sovereignty of God, acknowledging His control over her circumstances. "Empty" signifies the loss of her husband and sons, as well as her perceived loss of purpose and identity. This reflects the cultural importance of family and lineage in ancient Israel. The emptiness also symbolizes spiritual and emotional desolation, a theme echoed in Job's lament (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). Naomi's return to Bethlehem, the "house of bread," during the barley harvest (<a href="/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>) foreshadows the restoration and provision that God will bring.<p><b>Why call me Naomi?</b><br>Naomi's name means "pleasant" or "delightful," and she questions its appropriateness given her current state of bitterness and sorrow. This reflects the biblical theme of names and their significance, as seen in other scriptural accounts where names are changed to reflect new realities or divine encounters (e.g., Abram to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>). Naomi's question underscores her struggle with identity and the impact of her suffering.<p><b>After all, the LORD has testified against me</b><br>Naomi perceives her suffering as a divine testimony against her, suggesting a belief in retributive justice common in the Old Testament. This reflects the cultural understanding of God's direct involvement in the fortunes and misfortunes of individuals. The idea of God testifying against someone is seen in the lamentations of Job (<a href="/job/16-8.htm">Job 16:8</a>) and the psalms of David (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>), where personal suffering is interpreted as divine judgment.<p><b>and the Almighty has afflicted me.</b><br>The use of "Almighty" (Shaddai) emphasizes God's power and authority. Naomi's statement reflects a deep sense of personal affliction and divine chastisement. This aligns with the biblical theme of God as both a source of comfort and a figure of awe-inspiring power, as seen in the narratives of the patriarchs and the prophets. Naomi's lament is a precursor to the redemptive arc that will unfold, pointing to the ultimate restoration and hope found in Christ, who bears our afflictions (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A central figure in the Book of Ruth, Naomi is a widow who returns to Bethlehem from Moab after the death of her husband and sons.

Naomi interprets her loss through that covenant lens.<p>- The prophets use similar language when national sin brings judgment (<a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).<p>- Even so, God&#8217;s testimonies ultimately aim at restoration, not destruction (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Almighty has afflicted me</b><p>- &#8220;Almighty&#8221; (Shaddai) stresses God&#8217;s absolute power; Naomi acknowledges nothing happens outside His hand (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p>- Affliction in Scripture can refine faith (<a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p>- Her words echo Job&#8217;s lament (<a href="/job/30-20.htm">Job 30:20, 24</a>) yet Job&#8217;s story&#8212;and Ruth&#8217;s&#8212;show the Lord weaving suffering into eventual blessing.<p>- Standing in Bethlehem, Naomi is unaware that God is already turning her affliction into future joy through Ruth and the lineage leading to David and, ultimately, Christ (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-17</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Naomi&#8217;s statement layers honest grief with unshaken belief in God&#8217;s control. She left Bethlehem feeling blessed by family; she returns feeling stripped of every support. Yet by calling Him &#8220;LORD&#8221; and &#8220;Almighty,&#8221; she affirms His sovereignty even while lamenting His discipline. Scripture invites such truthful lament, using it as fertile ground for renewed hope. In Naomi&#8217;s emptiness, God is quietly setting the stage for redemption&#8212;both for her household and, through her descendant Jesus, for the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I went forth full, and Yahveh has caused me to return in emptiness. Why should you call me Naomi, and Yahveh has testified against me, and the Almighty has brought evil upon me?</span> She went forth "full," with husband and sons, not to speak of goods. She was under the necessity of returning <span class="accented">in emptiness</span>, or <span class="accented">with empty</span> hands. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> does not exactly mean <span class="accented">empty</span>, as it is rendered in the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version. It is not an adjective, but an adverb, <span class="accented">emptily</span>. This lamentable change of circumstances she attributed to the action of Yahveh. He had, she believed, been testifying against her by means of the trials through which she had passed. She was right in a certain conditional acceptation of her language; but only on <span class="accented">condition of that condition</span>. And, let us condition her declarations as we may, she was probably in danger of making the same mistake concerning herself and her trials which was made by Job's comforters in reference to the calamities by which he was overwhelmed. In so far as <span class="accented">penal evil is</span> concerned, it may be traced directly or circuitously to the will and government of God. "<span class="accented">Shall</span> there be <span class="accented">evil -</span> that is, penal evil - in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). But <span class="accented">there are many sufferings that are not penal</span>. The evil that is penal is only one segment of physical evil; and then there is besides, metaphysical evil, or the evil that consists in the inevitable imperfection of finite being. It is noteworthy that the participle of the Hiphilic verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> employed by Naomi is always translated in King James s version <span class="accented">evil doer</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked doer</span>, or <span class="accented">evil</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked</span>, Naomi, in using such a term, and applying it to Yahveh, was walking on a theological precipice, where it is not needful that we should accompany her. Instead of the literal expression, '<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, we may, with our English wealth of conjunctions freely say, '<span class="accented">when</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>. There is a charm in the original simplicity. There is likewise a charm in the more complex structure of the free translation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1428;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;la&#7733;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">full,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has brought me back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1457;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#277;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#7687;a&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
