Their willingness to accompany Naomi highlights the strong familial bonds and loyalty that existed despite the cultural and religious differences. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the bond between a mother-in-law and her daughters-in-law was crucial, especially after the death of the husbands. This phrase sets the stage for the unfolding story of loyalty and devotion, particularly Ruth's, which becomes a central theme in the book.<p><b>she left the place where she had been living</b><br>Naomi had been living in Moab, a region east of the Dead Sea, for about ten years. Moab was often in conflict with Israel, and its people were descendants of Lot. The decision to leave Moab signifies a turning point for Naomi, as she seeks to return to her homeland after the deaths of her husband and sons. This departure can be seen as a step of faith, leaving behind a place of sorrow and loss to return to her roots in Judah.<p><b>and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah</b><br>The journey from Moab to Judah was not just a physical journey but also a spiritual and emotional one. Judah, specifically Bethlehem, is significant as it is the land of Naomi's origin and the future birthplace of King David and Jesus Christ. This return to Judah symbolizes a return to God's covenant land and His people. The road to Judah represents a path of hope and redemption, foreshadowing the restoration and blessings that will come through Ruth's eventual marriage to Boaz, a kinsman-redeemer, which is a type of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naomi.htm">Naomi</a></b><br>A widow from Bethlehem in Judah who had moved to Moab due to famine.

The jealousies that so often disturb the peace of households had no place within the bounds of Naomi's jurisdiction. The home of which she was the matronly center had been kept in its own beautiful orbit by the law of mutual respect, deference, affection, and esteem - the law that insures happiness to both the loving and the loved.

Such is the picture. It must be subsumed in it that her daughters-in-law had made up their minds to go with her to the land of her nativity. The subject had been often talked over and discussed. Naomi would from time to time start objections to their kind intention. They, on their part, would try to remove her difficulties, and would insist on accompanying her. So the three widows journeyed onward together, <span class="accented">walking</span>.
