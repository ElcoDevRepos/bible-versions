In the context of ancient Israel, gleaning was a provision in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>) that allowed the poor and foreigners to gather leftover crops from the fields. Boaz goes beyond the law's requirements by instructing his workers to intentionally pull out stalks for Ruth, demonstrating a spirit of compassion and grace. This act foreshadows the abundant grace found in Jesus Christ, who provides for our needs beyond what we deserve.<p><b>and leave them for her to gather</b><br>Boaz's instructions ensure that Ruth can gather with dignity and without fear of being shamed or harassed. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for the vulnerable and marginalized, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). The act of leaving stalks for Ruth also symbolizes God's provision and care for His people, as He orchestrates circumstances to meet their needs. This mirrors the way God provides for us through His providence and the community of believers.<p><b>Do not rebuke her.&#8221;</b><br>Boaz's command to his workers not to rebuke Ruth underscores the importance of treating others with respect and kindness, regardless of their social status or background. In a time when Moabites were often viewed with suspicion and prejudice (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>), Boaz's acceptance of Ruth is a powerful testament to the inclusive nature of God's love. This anticipates the New Testament message of unity and acceptance in Christ, where there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).

Boaz is turning an ordinary workday into an extraordinary display of covenant kindness.<p>- Instead of merely tolerating a poor foreign widow at the edge of the field, he calls his men to active generosity, echoing the spirit of <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>, where God commands landowners to leave portions of the crop for the needy.<p>- By choosing this course, Boaz embodies <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD&#8221;&#8212;and points ahead to the grace believers are to show one another (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pull out for her some stalks from the bundles</b><p>- Boaz does more than permit gleaning; he orders his workers to pull stalks out of their neatly bound sheaves. This means grain that rightfully belongs to him is now intentionally reassigned to Ruth.<p>- Such planned generosity surpasses the minimum requirement of the law, illustrating <a href="/psalms/112-5.htm">Psalm 112:5</a>, &#8220;Good will come to the man who is generous and lends freely.&#8221;<p>- In practical terms, Ruth receives not scattered leftovers but prime stalks: evidence of how God &#8220;is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or imagine&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>- For contemporary believers, the principle rings clear&#8212;share intentionally, not merely incidentally (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Leave them for her to gather</b><p>- Boaz preserves Ruth&#8217;s dignity by letting her gather the grain herself. Charity is offered, but productive effort is still honored&#8212;aligning with <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, which upholds the value of honest labor.<p>- Ruth&#8217;s gathering also knits her into the community; she participates, rather than being reduced to a passive recipient. This reflects the balanced generosity urged in <a href="/proverbs/31-20.htm">Proverbs 31:20</a>, where the virtuous woman &#8220;extends her hand to the poor.&#8221;<p>- Spiritually, God often provides in ways that invite our cooperation&#8212;think of the manna (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>) or the filling of water jars before Jesus turned water into wine (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not rebuke her</b><p>- Protection accompanies provision. Boaz instructs his men to guard Ruth&#8217;s honor: she is not to be scolded, shamed, or driven away.<p>- This safeguarding echoes <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;You must not mistreat or oppress a foreigner&#8221;&#8212;and <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>, which links pure religion to caring for the vulnerable.<p>- Boaz&#8217;s care foreshadows the Good Shepherd who protects His flock (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>) and calls believers to &#8220;speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>).<p>- The command underscores that true generosity is holistic: meeting material need while preserving personal worth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/2-16.htm">Ruth 2:16</a> portrays God&#8217;s heart through Boaz&#8217;s actions: a deliberate, abundant, dignifying, and protective generosity that goes beyond legal obligation. Boaz not only leaves grain&#8212;he instructs his workers to pull out sheaves, grant Ruth the joy of gathering, and shield her from shame. The verse invites every follower of Christ to mirror this same intentional kindness, confident that the Lord who authored such provision remains faithful to all who seek refuge under His wings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And even of set purpose draw out for her from the bundles, and leave them, and let her glean them, and do not find fault with her.</span> His kindness grows as he sees her, or speaks concerning her. He gives additional injunctions in her favor, both to the young men and to the maidens, though the line of distinction between the two sexes dips at times entirely out of sight. When the sheaf-makers had gathered an armful of stalks, and there seemed to be so clean a sweep that none were left behind, then they were of set purpose (<span class="accented">de industria</span>) to draw out some from the bunches or bundles, and leave them lying. The act of deliberate, as opposed to unintentional, drawing, is expressed by the emphatic repetition of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. The verb thus repeated was a puzzle to the older expositors, inclusive of all the Hebrew commentators. But comparative philology has clearly determined its radical import, and thus illuminated its use in the passage before us. It does not here mean "spoil," though that is its usual signification. Nor can it mean "let fall," as in King James's version. It means <span class="accented">draw out</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Do not find fault with her.</span> The word is almost always rendered <span class="accented">rebuke</span> in our English version; but the force of the preposition may be represented thus: "do not chide 'with' her." "It was," says Dr. Andrew Thomson, "a thoughtful and delicate form of kindness to Ruth, thus to increase her gleanings, and yet to make them all appear the fruit of her own industry.... There are persons to be met with in social life who, while possessing the more solid qualities of moral excellence, are singularly deficient in the more graceful. They have honesty, but they have no sensibility; they have truth, but they are strangely wanting in tenderness. They are distinguished by <span class="accented">whatsoever things are just and pure</span>, but not by those which are <span class="accented">lovely and of good report</span>. You have the marble column, but you have not the polish or the delicate tracery on its surface; you have the rugged oak, but you miss the jasmine or the honeysuckle creeping gracefully around it from its roots. But the conduct of Boaz, as we stand and hear him giving these directions to his reapers, proves the compatibility of those two forms of excellence, and how the strong and the amiable may meet and harmonies in the same character. Indeed, they <span class="accented">do</span> always meet in the highest forms of moral greatness" ('Studies on the Book of Ruth,' pp. 119, 120). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rather,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1463;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
