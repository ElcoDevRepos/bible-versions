In the ancient Near Eastern context, gleaning was a provision for the poor, widows, and foreigners, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19-22</a>. Ruth's actions demonstrate her obedience to God's law and her integration into the community of Israel. Boaz's field represents a place of safety and provision, foreshadowing the protection and provision found in Christ.<p><b>to glean grain</b><br>Gleaning was a practice that allowed the less fortunate to gather leftover crops after the harvesters had passed through. This reflects God's care for the marginalized and His command for His people to show compassion. Ruth's gleaning is symbolic of God's grace, as she finds favor in Boaz's eyes, much like believers find grace through faith in Christ.<p><b>until the barley and wheat harvests were finished</b><br>The barley harvest typically began in April, followed by the wheat harvest in May and June. This timeframe indicates Ruth's diligence and perseverance over several months. The completion of these harvests signifies a period of provision and sustenance, paralleling the spiritual nourishment and fulfillment found in a relationship with God.<p><b>And she lived with her mother-in-law</b><br>Ruth's continued residence with Naomi underscores her loyalty and commitment to her family. This relationship is a testament to the covenantal love and faithfulness that mirrors God's relationship with His people. Naomi's presence in Ruth's life also serves as a guiding influence, much like the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ruth.htm">Ruth</a></b><br>A Moabite widow who has shown great loyalty to her mother-in-law, Naomi, by staying with her and adopting her people and God.

Ruth doesn&#8217;t drift in and out of Boaz&#8217;s fields; she purposefully &#8220;stayed close,&#8221; echoing her earlier vow to Naomi (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; This nearness kept her under Boaz&#8217;s protective word: &#8220;Stay here with my maidservants&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-8.htm">Ruth 2:8</a>). Staying where God provides safety is a mark of trust (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Abiding imagery flows through Scripture&#8212;&#8220;Abide in Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>). Ruth models the blessing that comes from remaining where God has directed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the servant girls of Boaz</b><p>&#8226; Ruth aligns herself with the right company. Boaz&#8217;s female workers would guard purity and reputation in a culture where a lone woman could be vulnerable (<a href="/ruth/2-9.htm">Ruth 2:9, 22</a>).<p>&#8226; Community matters. &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>), but godly companions sharpen faith (<a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Boaz&#8217;s servants represent a covenant environment; they belong to a man who honors the Lord (<a href="/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>). Ruth places herself under godly leadership, paving the way for future blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to glean grain</b><p>&#8226; Gleaning is humble, hands-on labor. Ruth isn&#8217;t waiting for handouts; she works within God&#8217;s provision for the poor (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-19.htm">Deuteronomy 24:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture dignifies labor&#8212;&#8220;If anyone is not willing to work, neither let him eat&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>). Ruth&#8217;s diligence anticipates the &#8220;noble wife&#8221; who &#8220;works with willing hands&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Gleaning also foreshadows grace: she gathers what she did not plant, just as believers reap salvation they did not earn (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the barley and wheat harvests were finished</b><p>&#8226; Ruth&#8217;s faithfulness spans both spring harvests, roughly April to June&#8212;about two months of steady effort. She doesn&#8217;t quit when the initial excitement wanes (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The double harvest hints at abundance. God moves Ruth from scarcity in Moab to ongoing provision in Bethlehem (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Timing in Scripture is purposeful: &#8220;There is a time for every purpose&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>). Ruth&#8217;s patient service sets the stage for her eventual redemption by Boaz (<a href="/bsb/ruth/3.htm">Ruth 3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And she lived with her mother-in-law</b><p>&#8226; Even while working in Boaz&#8217;s fields, Ruth remains devoted to Naomi.

She preserves propriety, returning home each night (<a href="/ruth/2-18.htm">Ruth 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their shared household is a picture of covenant loyalty, mirroring how the Church lives in devoted fellowship while awaiting her Redeemer (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ruth/2-23.htm">Ruth 2:23</a> shows a woman who abides where God places her, surrounds herself with godly company, works diligently within His provision, perseveres through the full season, and remains loyal to family.

But the maidens of Boaz are not represented as gleaning. The historical statement of the verse is to be explained from the hortatory statement of ver. 8: "Keep close to my young women." <span class="cmt_word">Till the end of the barley-harvest and the wheat-harvest.</span> Ruth's gleaning labors extended to the close of the wheat-harvest, during which time, no doubt, there would be frequent opportunities for a growing intimacy between the beautiful gleaner and the worthy proprietor. Often too, we may rest assured, would Boaz be a visitor in the humble home of Naomi. "The harvest upon the mountains," says Dr. Robinson, "<span class="accented">ripens</span> of course later than in the plains of the Jordan and the sea-coast. The barley-harvest precedes the wheat-harvest by a week or fortnight. On the 4th and 5th of June the people of Hebron were just beginning to gather their wheat; on the 11th and 12th the threshing-floors on the Mount of Olives were in full operation. We had already seen the harvest in the same stage of progress on the plains of Gaza on the 19th of May; while at <span class="accented">Jericho</span>, on the 12th of May, the threshing-floors had nearly completed their work" ('Biblical Researches,' vol. 2. p. 99). "The Syrian harvest," says Dr. W. M. Thomson, "<span class="accented">ex</span>tends through several months. On the plain of Philistia it commences in April and ends in June; and this not only gives ample time, but it has this great advantage, that the villagers from the mountains can assist the farmers on the plain, since their own crops are not yet ripe. I was struck with this fact while at Mesmia. Several Christians from Bethlehem, who had thus come to reap, spent the evening at my tent, and one of them explained to me the advantages from thus laboring on the plain. He not only, received wages for his own and his wife s labor, but his children were permitted to follow after them and glean on their own account, as Boaz allowed Ruth to do in their native village" ('The Land and the Book, ' p. 544). When it is said, in the last clause of the verse, and <span class="cmt_word">she dwelt with her mother-in-law</span>, the reference is not to be restricted to the time that succeeded the period of harvesting. The Vulgate indeed connects the clause with the following verse, and renders it, "After she returned to her mother-in-law," pointing the verb thus <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. The same translation is given to the verb by Luther and Coverdale. But there is no evidence whatever that Ruth slept anywhere else than under her mother-in-law's roof. The clause was written, apparently, for the very purpose of bringing out clearly before the mind of the reader her stainless innocence, and sweet simplicity, and never-tiring devotion to her noble mother-in-law. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ruth/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Ruth stayed close</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7695;&#183;baq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
