It underscores the authority and seriousness of the pronouncement. In the prophetic tradition, this formula is used to convey that the prophet is speaking on behalf of God, not from personal opinion.<p><b>For three transgressions of Tyre, even four,</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom indicating a fullness or completeness of sin, suggesting that Tyre's sins are numerous and have reached a tipping point. Tyre was a prominent Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade. The repetition of "three... even four" is a rhetorical device used throughout Amos to emphasize the gravity of the offenses.<p><b>I will not revoke My judgment,</b><br>God's decision is firm and irreversible. This reflects the justice of God, who cannot overlook persistent sin. The certainty of divine judgment is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, highlighting God's holiness and the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>because they delivered up a whole congregation of exiles to Edom</b><br>Tyre is accused of betraying a group of people, likely Israelites, by handing them over to Edom, a neighboring nation often hostile to Israel. This act of betrayal is significant, as it involves the violation of trust and the mistreatment of vulnerable individuals. Historically, Edom and Israel had a contentious relationship, and Tyre's actions would have been seen as exacerbating this enmity.<p><b>and broke a covenant of brotherhood.</b><br>This phrase suggests that there was an agreement or understanding between Tyre and Israel that was violated. In the ancient Near East, covenants were serious commitments, often sealed with oaths and rituals. The breaking of such a covenant would be seen as a grave offense, not only against the other party but also against God, who is often invoked as a witness to covenants. This breach of trust highlights the moral and ethical failures of Tyre, contributing to the justification for divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages of judgment to Israel and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tyre.htm">Tyre</a></b><br>An ancient Phoenician city known for its wealth and trade, located on the Mediterranean coast.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, often in conflict with Israel, located southeast of the Dead Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_of_brotherhood.htm">Covenant of Brotherhood</a></b><br>A likely reference to a treaty or agreement of mutual respect and peace, possibly between Tyre and Israel or Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exiles.htm">Exiles</a></b><br>People who were captured and sold or delivered into slavery, violating the covenant of brotherhood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_betrayal.htm">The Seriousness of Betrayal</a></b><br>Betrayal of trust and breaking of covenants are serious offenses in God's eyes.

The sin of Tyre, the great Phoenician merchant city, was committed in concert with the Philistines (comp. <a href="/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>), and was of the same character, except that she is not accused of carrying away the captives, but only of handing them over to the Edomites. It is probable that the Phoenicians had gotten into their hands, by purchase or some other means, Israelitish prisoners, whom they delivered over to the Edomites, forgetting the brotherly covenant made by their forefathers with David and Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1, 7-11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>). The cruel conduct of Tyre was quits unprovoked, as no Jewish king had made war against Phoenicia or its capital. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">transgressions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pi&#353;&#183;&#8216;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6588.htm">Strong's 6588: </a> </span><span class="str2">Transgression</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Tyre,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1465;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6865.htm">Strong's 6865: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tyre -- a Phoenician city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
