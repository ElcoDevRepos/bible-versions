The imagery of trampling suggests a callous disregard for the vulnerable, reflecting a society where the wealthy and powerful exploit the poor. This behavior is condemned throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>, which states, "Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker." The metaphor of dust emphasizes the insignificance with which the poor are treated, akin to the dust trodden underfoot. This reflects a violation of the covenantal laws given to Israel, which emphasized justice and care for the marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>).<p><b>they push the needy out of their way.</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate exclusion and marginalization of the needy, further illustrating the systemic injustice in society. The act of pushing suggests an active effort to remove the needy from places of opportunity or justice. This behavior contradicts the biblical mandate to care for the less fortunate, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, which calls for defending the oppressed. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on community and mutual support, making this behavior particularly egregious. The prophets frequently rebuked such actions, emphasizing God's concern for justice and righteousness.<p><b>A man and his father have relations with the same girl</b><br>This phrase addresses sexual immorality and the breakdown of family and societal norms. Such actions were explicitly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8, 15</a>), which sought to maintain purity and respect within family structures. The mention of both a man and his father engaging in relations with the same girl suggests a deep moral corruption and a disregard for God's commandments. This behavior not only violates personal and familial boundaries but also reflects a broader cultural decay. The prophets often used such examples to illustrate Israel's unfaithfulness to God, likening it to spiritual adultery.<p><b>and so profane My holy name.</b><br>The phrase underscores the spiritual implications of the aforementioned actions. To profane God's holy name means to bring dishonor to His character and reputation. In biblical theology, God's name is synonymous with His nature and presence. The Israelites were called to be a holy people, reflecting God's holiness to the nations (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). By engaging in injustice and immorality, they failed in their covenantal role, bringing shame upon God's name. This concept is echoed in the Lord's Prayer, where believers are taught to hallow God's name (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>), emphasizing the importance of living in a way that honors God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment to Israel and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, recipient of Amos's prophetic messages, often criticized for social injustices and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_and_oppressed.htm">The Poor and Oppressed</a></b><br>Individuals in society who are marginalized and exploited, central to the injustices Amos condemns.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father_and_son.htm">The Father and Son</a></b><br>Representing a broader societal moral decay, engaging in sexual immorality that profanes God's name.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge who is concerned with justice and righteousness, whose name is profaned by Israel's actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/social_justice_and_righteousness.htm">Social Justice and Righteousness</a></b><br>God is deeply concerned with how society treats its most vulnerable members.

The meek are defrauded as being too weak to claim their own.

The obscure expression in the text is capable of two explanations. Hitzig, Pusey, Trochon, assume that its meaning is that in their avarice and cupidity the usurers or tyrannous rich men grudge even the dust which the poor man strews upon his head in token of his sorrow at being brought to so low a state. But this seems unnatural and farfetched, and scarcely in harmony with the simple style of Amos. The other explanation, supported by Kimchi, Sehegg, Keil, and Knabenbauer, is preferable. These oppressors desire eagerly to see the poor crushed to the earth, or so miserable as to scatter dust on their heads (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>). <span class="accented">The poor</span> (<span class="accented">dal</span>, not the same word as in ver. 6); <span class="accented">depressed</span>, as brought low in condition.

The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Qui conterunt super pulverem terrae capita pauperum</span>, "Who bruise the heads of the poor on the dust of the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Turn aside the way of the meek.</span> They thwart and hinder their path of life, and force them into crooked and evil ways. Or <span class="accented">way</span>, according to Kimchi, may mean "judicial process," as <a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>. This gives, to the clause much the same meaning as ver. 6. <span class="accented">The meek</span> are those who are lowly and unassuming (see note on Zephaniah 2:3). <span class="cmt_word">And a man</span> <span class="cmt_word">and his father will go in unto the same maid;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate, which omits "the same," is closer to the Hebrew, <span class="accented">Et filius ac pater ejus ierunt ad puellam</span>, though the Greek doubtless gives the intended meaning. This sin, which was tantamount to incest, was virtually forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8, 15</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>). Some (as Ewald, Maurer, Gandell) see here an allusion to the organized prostitution in idol temples (<a href="/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>), but this seems unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">To profane my holy Name</span> (<a href="/leviticus/22-32.htm">Leviticus 22:32</a>). Such crimes dishonoured the God who called them his people, so that to them could be applied what St. Paul says (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>), "The Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you" (comp. <a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20, 23</a>). The word <span class="accented">lemaan</span>, "in order that," implies that they committed these sins, not through ignorance, but intentionally, to bring discredit upon the true faith and worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They trample</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1508;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
