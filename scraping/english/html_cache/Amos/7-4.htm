Visions were a common way God communicated with His prophets, providing them with divine insight into His plans and purposes. Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa, was called by God to deliver messages primarily to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The phrase emphasizes the authority and divine origin of the message, underscoring that it is not Amos's own thoughts but a revelation from God.<p><b>The Lord GOD was calling for judgment by fire:</b><br>Fire is often used in the Bible as a symbol of God's judgment and purification. In the context of Amos, it signifies a severe and consuming judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where fire represents God's wrath and the purging of sin (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>, <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>). The use of "calling for" indicates that this judgment is not arbitrary but a deliberate act of divine justice in response to the sins of Israel.<p><b>It consumed the great deep:</b><br>The "great deep" likely refers to the primordial waters or the subterranean waters believed to be the source of the earth's water supply. In ancient Near Eastern cosmology, the deep was often associated with chaos and the unknown. The consumption of the great deep by fire suggests a total and overwhelming judgment that affects even the most foundational elements of creation. This imagery highlights the extent and intensity of God's judgment.<p><b>and devoured the land:</b><br>The land, representing the physical territory of Israel, is depicted as being devoured by the fire. This signifies the complete devastation that God's judgment would bring upon the nation. Historically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Assyrian invasion and exile that would come upon Israel as a result of their persistent idolatry and injustice. The destruction of the land also serves as a warning to the people to repent and return to God, as the land was a covenantal gift from God to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and just God who reveals His plans to His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_by_fire.htm">Judgment by Fire</a></b><br>A symbolic vision representing God's impending judgment on Israel, indicating total destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_deep.htm">The Great Deep</a></b><br>Often understood as the primeval waters or the depths of the earth, symbolizing the foundational elements of creation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, which is the subject of God's judgment due to its people's sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and just in His judgments.
