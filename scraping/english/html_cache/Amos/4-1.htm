Prophets often began their messages with a call to listen, underscoring the importance of the message from God. This is a common prophetic formula seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/2-4.htm">Jeremiah 2:4</a>.<p><b>you cows of Bashan on Mount Samaria</b><br>The "cows of Bashan" refers to the well-fed, pampered women of Samaria, drawing a metaphor from the fertile region of Bashan known for its strong and healthy cattle (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>, <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>). Mount Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, a place of wealth and power. The imagery suggests indulgence and excess, highlighting the moral and spiritual decay of the society.<p><b>you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy</b><br>This phrase condemns the social injustice prevalent in Israel. The women, representing the affluent class, are accused of exploiting the vulnerable, a theme frequently addressed by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>, <a href="/micah/2.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>). The oppression of the poor is a violation of the covenantal laws given to Israel, which emphasized justice and care for the marginalized (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21-24</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>).<p><b>who say to your husbands, &#8220;Bring us more to drink.&#8221;</b><br>This statement illustrates the self-indulgence and moral corruption of the society. The demand for more drink signifies a lifestyle of excess and disregard for others' suffering. It reflects a culture of hedonism and materialism, similar to the warnings given in <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>.
