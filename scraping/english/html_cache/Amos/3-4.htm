Lions were known to inhabit the forests and thickets of the region, and their roar was a sign of their dominance and presence. The rhetorical question posed here implies that a lion's roar is purposeful, typically signaling the capture of prey. This imagery is used to illustrate the certainty and inevitability of God's judgment. Just as a lion does not roar without reason, God does not pronounce judgment without cause. The lion's roar can be seen as a metaphor for the prophetic warnings given by Amos, indicating that the impending judgment is both deserved and imminent. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God's justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>, where God is likened to a lion defending its territory.<p><b>Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?</b><br>The young lion, or cub, represents a stage of growth and learning, yet it still possesses the instinct to hunt and capture prey. The growl in the den signifies satisfaction and possession of what has been caught. In the prophetic context, this suggests that God's actions are deliberate and based on the reality of Israel's transgressions. The imagery of the young lion in its den also evokes a sense of security and inevitability; once the prey is caught, it is brought back to the den. This can be paralleled with the certainty of God's plans and the fulfillment of His word, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which speaks of God's word accomplishing what He desires. The use of the lion imagery throughout the Bible often points to the power and authority of God, as well as the fulfillment of His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages to the northern kingdom of Israel.

A random, purposeless roar would give prey a chance to flee, so the roar implies a sure capture.<p>&#8226; Amos uses this obvious cause-and-effect picture to say, &#8220;When God&#8217;s judgment roar is heard, it is because sin has been seized and sentence is in motion.&#8221; Compare <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a> (&#8220;The LORD roars from Zion&#8221;) and <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a> (&#8220;The lion has roared&#8212;who will not fear?&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Other passages confirm that a lion&#8217;s roar points to imminent action, not empty sound: <a href="/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a> speaks of the destroyer coming up &#8220;like a lion,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a> notes that &#8220;young lions roar for prey.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For Israel, the prophetic roar proved that their covenant breaking (<a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>) had reached a tipping point. Like a hunter who never fires without a target, the LORD never roars without a moral reason.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?</b><p>&#8220;Does a young lion growl in his den if he has caught nothing?&#8221; (<a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a>b)<p>&#8226; The growl in the den is the satisfied rumble of a cub with meat between its teeth. If the den were empty, silence would prevail.<p>&#8226; Amos links that satisfied growl to the prophetic word already delivered: God&#8217;s message is not speculation; the prey (Israel&#8217;s sin) is in His grasp. See <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>, where God likens Himself to a lion tearing its prey and carrying it to the den.<p>&#8226; The young lion imagery stresses certainty. What begins as a distant roar in the forest ends with the quiet, possessive growl at home. Likewise, what starts as prophetic warning ends in executed judgment if unheeded.<p>&#8226; Cross-reference <a href="/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10-11</a>, where the lion&#8217;s teeth break when God removes prey, illustrating divine control over every outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/3-4.htm">Amos 3:4</a> uses two self-evident animal behaviors to prove a spiritual reality: lions only roar or growl when a kill is sure, and God only sends a prophetic roar when judgment is certain. Israel&#8217;s persistent sin brought the prey within divine reach. The verse calls readers to recognize the inevitability of God&#8217;s actions once His voice sounds&#8212;prompting a humble, immediate return to covenant faithfulness before the roar outside becomes the growl within.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Lion.--</span>The questions suggest that the prey is being seized. This is intimated by the lion's roar, the loud roar of the lion in the forest, the growl of the famished young lions in the den. Aben-Ezra thus interprets; but G. Baur thinks that <span class= "ital">Caphir</span> distinguishes a "hunting lion" from the beast that growls in his lair. (Comp. <a href="/amos/1-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.">Amos 1:2</a>.) Amos, by his graphic representation of the terrifying threat, signifies that nations, and kingdoms, and this family of Israel, are, at the present moment, trembling in the grasp of the great Avenger.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will a lion roar,</span> etc.? The lion roars when he has his pray in sight, and is about to spring upon it. So God makes the prophet utter his voice because he is ready to execute vengeance. The second clause expresses the same fact in different terms. The young lion (<span class="accented">kephir</span>) is not a whelp, but one able to provide for itself. He growls over the prey which he has in his lair. So Israel lies helpless as the words of God's threatenings strike upon him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Does a lion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_738.htm">Strong's 738: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lion</span><br /><br /><span class="word">roar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#8217;a&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7580.htm">Strong's 7580: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rumble, moan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the forest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
