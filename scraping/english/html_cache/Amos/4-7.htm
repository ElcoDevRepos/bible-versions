The timing of rain was particularly important, with the early rains in autumn and the latter rains in spring being essential for a good harvest. Withholding rain three months before the harvest would have been devastating, as it would prevent the crops from maturing properly. This act of withholding rain is a demonstration of God's control over nature and His ability to use it as a tool for judgment. In the broader biblical context, drought is often a sign of divine displeasure (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>). This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brought blessings and disobedience brought curses.<p><b>I sent rain on one city but withheld it from another.</b><br>This selective distribution of rain underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to bless or curse specific areas according to His will. It serves as a tangible sign of God's direct involvement in the affairs of His people. The differentiation between cities also emphasizes the personal nature of God's judgment, as He deals with communities based on their actions and relationship with Him. This selective blessing and cursing can be seen as a call to repentance, urging those who experience drought to turn back to God. The concept of God controlling rain is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>, where Elijah declares a drought as a judgment from God.<p><b>One field received rain; another without rain withered.</b><br>This phrase illustrates the stark contrast between blessing and judgment. The field that received rain thrived, symbolizing the life and prosperity that come from God's favor. In contrast, the field without rain withered, representing the desolation and hardship that result from God's judgment. This imagery is powerful in an agrarian context, where the health of the land directly impacts the survival of the people. The withering of the field can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual barrenness, where a lack of divine blessing leads to spiritual decay. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the vine and branches in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>, emphasizing the necessity of remaining in Him to bear fruit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and repentance to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often characterized by idolatry and social injustice during Amos's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rain_withholding.htm">Rain withholding</a></b><br>A divine act of judgment and a call to repentance, demonstrating God's control over nature and His desire for Israel to return to Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_and_fields.htm">Cities and fields</a></b><br>Represent the selective nature of God's judgment, emphasizing His sovereignty and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest_time.htm">Harvest time</a></b><br>A critical period for agricultural societies, highlighting the severity of God's judgment in withholding rain.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nature.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nature</a></b><br>God controls the elements and uses them to communicate with His people.
