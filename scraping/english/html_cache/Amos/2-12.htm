This vow included abstaining from wine and other products of the vine, refraining from cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with dead bodies. Forcing the Nazirites to drink wine was a direct violation of their vow and an act of rebellion against God's commands. This reflects the moral and spiritual decline of Israel, as they not only ignored God's laws but actively led others into sin. The Nazirites were meant to be examples of holiness and dedication, and corrupting them symbolized a broader societal rejection of God's standards.<p><b>and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.</b><br>Prophets were God's messengers, tasked with delivering His word to the people. By commanding the prophets not to prophesy, the Israelites were rejecting divine guidance and silencing God's voice among them. This act of defiance is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where God's messengers faced opposition, such as in <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>, where Micaiah was imprisoned for speaking God's truth. The suppression of prophecy indicates a hardened heart and a refusal to repent, leading to inevitable judgment. This rejection of prophetic voices can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate rejection of Jesus Christ, the greatest prophet, who was also silenced and rejected by His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages to the northern kingdom of Israel.

It mocked God&#8217;s instruction just as Samson&#8217;s enemies mocked his strength (<a href="/judges/16-15.htm">Judges 16:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>- Such pressure shows how far Israel&#8217;s leaders had drifted from honoring personal devotion. It echoes the negative example of those who tempted the Rechabites to break their family vow (<a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>- By corrupting the Nazirites, the nation effectively said, &#8220;We will not tolerate anyone who reminds us of God&#8217;s standards.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and commanded the prophets not to prophesy</b><p>- Prophets were God&#8217;s mouthpieces. Silencing them was silencing God. <a href="/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12&#8211;13</a> records Amaziah telling Amos, &#8220;do not prophesy anymore at Bethel,&#8221; illustrating the very sin Amos now exposes.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> describes the same attitude: people &#8220;say to the seers, &#8216;Do not see,&#8217; and to the prophets, &#8216;Do not prophesy the truth to us.&#8217; &#8221;<p>- Suppressing God&#8217;s word invites judgment. <a href="/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a> warns, &#8220;Therefore night will come over you&#8212;without visions, and darkness&#8212;without divination.&#8221;<p>- The New Testament mirrors the principle: <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:19&#8211;20</a> says, &#8220;Do not extinguish the Spirit. Do not treat prophecies with contempt.&#8221; Blocking prophetic voice always quenches spiritual life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/2-12.htm">Amos 2:12</a> exposes Israel&#8217;s rebellion in two vivid acts: corrupting those set apart to God and gagging those sent to speak for God. Both actions reject God Himself. The verse stands as a timeless warning: when society undermines consecration and silences truth, judgment is near, but those who honor God&#8217;s servants keep themselves aligned with His righteous standards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink.</span> Far from profiting by their example, or acknowledging the grace of God displayed in their holy lives, ye tried to get rid of their testimony by seducing or forcing them to break their vow. <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy not.</span> Israel was impatient of the continued efforts of the prophets to warn and to win; and, unmindful of the fact that the man of God had a message which he was bound to deliver (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), this ungrateful nation systematically tried to silence the voices which were a standing rebuke to them.
