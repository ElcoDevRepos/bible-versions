"Zion" refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah. The people at ease are complacent, indulging in luxury and ignoring the moral and spiritual decay around them. This complacency is condemned because it reflects a false sense of security and neglect of God's covenant. The warning is reminiscent of other prophetic calls to repentance, such as <a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9-11</a>, where women are warned against complacency.<p><b>and those secure on Mount Samaria</b><br>Mount Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The reference to security here is ironic, as the people felt safe due to their military strength and alliances, yet they were spiritually bankrupt. This false security is a common theme in the prophets, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/28.htm">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>, where Ephraim's pride is rebuked. The historical context includes the Assyrian threat, which would eventually lead to Samaria's fall in 722 BC.<p><b>the distinguished ones of the foremost nation</b><br>This phrase highlights the leaders and elites who were considered the "distinguished" or "notable" ones. They were responsible for guiding the nation but were instead leading it astray. The "foremost nation" refers to Israel's perceived status among the nations, a status that led to pride and self-reliance rather than dependence on God. This mirrors the critique found in <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a>, where leaders are held accountable for the nation's moral failures.<p><b>to whom the house of Israel comes</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the people of the Northern Kingdom who looked to these leaders for guidance and protection. This phrase underscores the responsibility of the leaders to shepherd the people according to God's laws. The failure of leadership is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God condemns the shepherds of Israel for neglecting the flock. This also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who would lead His people with righteousness and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often used to refer to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel.

To be &#8220;at ease&#8221; here is not blessed rest but careless complacency.<p>&#8226; Complacency among God&#8217;s people has never been tolerated. Amos had already cried, &#8220;Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD!&#8221; (<a href="/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18</a>), warning that presuming on covenant privilege while ignoring covenant obligation brings disaster.<p>&#8226; Isaiah echoed the same theme: &#8220;Rise up, you complacent women&#8230; tremble, you confident daughters&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/32-9.htm">Isaiah 32:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; God promises to &#8220;search Jerusalem with lamps and punish the complacent&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/1-12.htm">Zephaniah 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ rebukes Laodicea, &#8220;Because you say, &#8216;I am rich&#8230;&#8217; you do not realize that you are wretched&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>).<p>The consistent thread: when the people closest to God grow self-satisfied, He confronts them first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those secure on Mount Samaria</b><p>Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom, sat on an impressive hill&#8212;yet its elevation could not shield it from divine scrutiny.

So I will send fire upon his cities&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later told a parable of a rich man who said, &#8220;Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry,&#8221; only to hear, &#8220;This night your soul is required of you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>Earthly security without humble dependence on the LORD is a mirage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the distinguished ones of the foremost nation</b><p>God now singles out the leaders&#8212;the men and women of influence who sat at the top of Israelite society. Their prominence made them stewards of national holiness, yet they used it for personal comfort.<p>&#8226; Micah challenged such elites: &#8220;Hear this, O heads of Jacob&#8230; who detest justice&#8230; they will cry to the LORD, but He will not answer&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah likewise indicted the nobles: &#8220;What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter later reminds believers that &#8220;it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>Position before people is never a shield against the righteous scrutiny of the King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to whom the house of Israel comes</b><p>The common people flocked to these leaders for guidance, justice, and example.
