It echoes the style of other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who often began their messages with similar calls to listen. This introduction indicates that what follows is a divine message, not merely the prophet's own words.<p><b>you who trample the needy</b><br>The imagery of trampling suggests violence and oppression. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the wealthy and powerful often exploited the poor, disregarding the Mosaic Law's commands to care for the less fortunate (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). This phrase highlights the social injustice prevalent in Israel at the time, where the rich were exploiting the vulnerable for personal gain. The prophets frequently condemned such behavior, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a> and <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>.<p><b>who do away with the poor of the land</b><br>This phrase indicates a systematic removal or marginalization of the poor, suggesting not just neglect but active harm. The "poor of the land" refers to those who were economically disadvantaged, often due to unjust practices like unfair trade or legal manipulation. This reflects a violation of the covenantal laws that required justice and mercy (<a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>). The phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's concern for the poor and oppressed, as seen in <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a> and <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Amos was a shepherd and a fig tree farmer, emphasizing his humble origins and the divine nature of his calling.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/northern_kingdom_of_israel.htm">Northern Kingdom of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of Amos's prophecies. During Amos's time, Israel was experiencing economic prosperity but was spiritually and morally corrupt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy_and_the_poor.htm">The Needy and the Poor</a></b><br>The marginalized and oppressed individuals in Israelite society who were being exploited by the wealthy and powerful. Amos's message highlights God's concern for social justice and the well-being of these individuals.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wealthy_and_powerful.htm">The Wealthy and Powerful</a></b><br>The societal elite in Israel who were exploiting the poor for their gain. Amos's prophecy condemns their actions and warns of impending judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event Amos prophesies as a consequence of Israel's social injustices and spiritual unfaithfulness. This judgment would come in the form of national calamity and exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_justice.htm">God's Concern for Justice</a></b><br>God is deeply concerned with how society treats its most vulnerable members.

Every word that follows carries His full authority, because &#8220;all Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Just as Israel had once been told, &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), so now the same voice insists that the people stop, listen, and submit. Jeremiah cried, &#8220;O land, land, land, hear the word of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), and James later insisted, &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Whenever God says &#8220;Hear,&#8221; He expects response, not indifference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you who trample the needy</b><p>The Lord names the sin: trampling the needy. This is no mere figure of speech; it describes literal economic and social oppression. Wealthy merchants manipulated scales (<a href="/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), charged excessive prices, and treated the poor as pawns. <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor taunts his Maker,&#8221; while <a href="/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a> asks, &#8220;Why crush My people and grind the faces of the poor?&#8221; <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-25</a> pictures the end result: the rich man who ignored Lazarus finds himself in torment. God takes personally how His image-bearers treat the vulnerable.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Oppression may be enacted in boardrooms as surely as on battlefields.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law protected the disadvantaged (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>); violating those commands invites judgment.<p>&#8226; Ignoring the cries of the needy silences one&#8217;s own prayers (<a href="/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who do away with the poor of the land</b><p>The phrase moves from trampling to removal&#8212;schemes that &#8220;do away with&#8221; the poor altogether by foreclosure, forced debt slavery, and land seizure. Amos had already exposed this pattern: &#8220;They sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals&#8221; (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>). Micah echoes, &#8220;They covet fields and seize them&#8221; (<a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> assures the oppressed, &#8220;Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise, says the LORD.&#8221; God sees both the act and the motive; He promises to defend the very people the powerful cast aside.<p>Practical implications:<p>&#8226; Wealth and influence are stewardship trusts, never licenses to exploit.<p>&#8226; Removing the poor erodes society&#8217;s moral foundation; God built safeguards into His covenant law to keep that from happening (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine judgment is certain for cultures that treat people as disposable commodities (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a> is God&#8217;s direct indictment of those who crush the helpless for profit. He commands attention (&#8220;Hear this&#8221;), exposes the crime (&#8220;trample the needy&#8221;), and condemns its ultimate goal (&#8220;do away with the poor&#8221;). Scripture consistently affirms that how we treat the vulnerable reflects our reverence for the Lord Himself. Those who listen and obey align with God&#8217;s heart; those who ignore the warning court inevitable judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Ye that swallow up</span> . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">ye that pant</span> (or <span class= "ital">are greedy</span>)<span class= "ital"> for the very ashes on their heads.</span><p><span class= "bld">Make . . . to fail.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">make</span> . . . <span class= "ital">to cease: i.e.,</span> destroy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The prophet, by admonishing the grandees of their iniquities, which they will not cast away, shows how ripe they are for judgment. <span class="cmt_word">That swallow up;</span> better, <span class="accented">that pant after</span> (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6, 7</a>), like a beast after its prey, eager to devour. <span class="cmt_word">Even to make the poor of the land to fail;</span> <span class="accented">and cause the meek of the land to fail.</span> They grasp at the property of the unresisting poor, adding field to field, and impoverishing them in various ways, to root them out of the land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you who trample</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1458;&#1508;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
