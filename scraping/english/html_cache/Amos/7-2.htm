Locust plagues were a common and feared disaster in the ancient Near East, often symbolizing divine judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>). The imagery of locusts is used elsewhere in Scripture to depict destruction and judgment, such as in <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>. The complete consumption of green plants signifies total desolation, leaving the land barren and the people without sustenance.<p><b>I said, &#8220;Lord GOD, please forgive!</b><br>Amos, as a prophet, intercedes on behalf of Israel, pleading for God's mercy. This reflects the role of prophets as mediators between God and His people. The plea for forgiveness indicates recognition of sin and the need for divine grace. The use of "Lord GOD" emphasizes the sovereignty and authority of God, acknowledging His power to forgive and relent from sending calamity.<p><b>How will Jacob survive, since he is so small?&#8221;</b><br>"Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel, using the patriarch's name to evoke the covenant relationship between God and His people. The phrase "since he is so small" highlights Israel's vulnerability and weakness, emphasizing their inability to withstand such judgment without divine intervention. This plea underscores the theme of God's mercy and the hope for restoration despite Israel's shortcomings. The reference to Israel's smallness can also be seen as a call for compassion, as God often shows favor to the humble and lowly (<a href="/psalms/138-6.htm">Psalm 138:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to Israel.
