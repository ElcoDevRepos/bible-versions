Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Israel, often associated with figures like David, who was also called from tending sheep to lead Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>). This reflects the biblical theme of God choosing the lowly and unexpected to fulfill His plans (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). The imagery of a shepherd is significant throughout Scripture, symbolizing care, guidance, and leadership, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>and said to me,</b><br>This indicates direct divine communication, a hallmark of prophetic calling. In the Old Testament, God often spoke to His prophets through visions, dreams, or direct speech, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). This personal encounter underscores the authority and authenticity of Amos's message, as he is not self-appointed but divinely commissioned.<p><b>&#8216;Go,</b><br>The command to "go" signifies a mission and a change in direction, often involving leaving one's comfort zone or previous life. This mirrors the call of other prophets and apostles, such as Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>) and the Great Commission given by Jesus to His disciples (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). It emphasizes obedience and the urgency of the prophetic message.<p><b>prophesy to My people Israel.&#8217;</b><br>Amos is specifically sent to prophesy to Israel, the northern kingdom, during a time of prosperity but also moral and spiritual decline. This highlights God's concern for His covenant people and His desire for their repentance and return to righteousness. The role of a prophet was to be God's spokesperson, delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope. Amos's message is consistent with the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to faithfulness, as seen in the ministries of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>) and Hosea (<a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>). The phrase "My people" underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, despite their unfaithfulness, pointing to God's enduring love and commitment to His people, ultimately fulfilled in the New Covenant through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A shepherd and fig tree farmer from Tekoa, called by God to be a prophet to Israel.

What happens is not Amos&#8217;s idea or a human committee&#8217;s decision; it is the Lord&#8217;s direct action (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>; <a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p>- By using &#8220;took,&#8221; the verse stresses a decisive, interrupting act. God steps into ordinary life and redirects it (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>).<p>- The statement also answers Amaziah&#8217;s charge that Amos is merely opportunistic (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>). Amos can stand firm because his authority rests on God&#8217;s call, not personal ambition (<a href="/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from following the flock</b><p>- Amos was tending sheep and dressing sycamore-fig trees (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>), a humble background similar to David&#8217;s (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>) and Moses&#8217; (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-10</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord choosing everyday laborers, proving that usefulness to God depends on obedience, not status (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>).<p>- &#8220;Following the flock&#8221; highlights faithfulness in small things. Before speaking for God, Amos was diligent in ordinary work&#8212;an encouragement that God notices quiet faithfulness (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to me</b><p>- God speaks personally; the call is relational, not mechanical (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-7</a>).<p>- Direct revelation authenticates the message. Amos does not rely on dreams, trends, or public opinion but on the living word of God (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>- The phrase shows covenant intimacy: the Creator converses with His servant, reflecting the pattern seen with Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Go, prophesy to My people Israel.&#8217;</b><p>- &#8220;Go&#8221; implies movement and mission. Amos must leave comfort zones and enter hostile territory&#8212;the northern kingdom that will resist his words (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16-20</a>).<p>- &#8220;Prophesy&#8221; means to speak God&#8217;s message with authority and urgency. The task is not optional; it is a command (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>).<p>- &#8220;My people Israel&#8221; reminds listeners of covenant privilege and responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). God still claims them, even as He warns them.<p>- The commission also foreshadows the Great Commission principle: God sends His servants to confront sin and call for repentance because He loves His people (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/7-15.htm">Amos 7:15</a> reveals a God who interrupts ordinary lives to accomplish extraordinary purposes. The Lord personally seized Amos, lifted him from simple shepherding, spoke directly to him, and sent him on a risky, indispensable mission. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s call is sovereign, personal, and purposeful&#8212;rooted in His unwavering claim over His people and fueled by His desire to speak truth through obedient servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Followed the</span> <span class= "bld">flock.--</span>There is no hint of any lack of education or refinement (see Introduction) through the exclusion of any special aid derived from the training of earlier prophets.
