The wealthy and powerful were exploiting the poor, contrary to the Mosaic Law, which emphasized justice and care for the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>). The prophets often condemned such behavior, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14-15</a> and <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>. This exploitation is a direct violation of God's covenant, which required Israel to act justly and love mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and exact from him a tax of grain</b><br>The taxation mentioned here refers to the oppressive economic practices that burdened the poor. Grain was a staple, and taxing it heavily would have been a significant hardship. This reflects the broader economic injustices condemned by the prophets, where the rich grew wealthier at the expense of the poor (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>). Such practices were contrary to the Jubilee laws, which aimed to prevent perpetual poverty (Leviticus 25).<p><b>you will never live in the stone houses you have built</b><br>Stone houses were a sign of wealth and permanence, contrasting with the more common mud-brick homes. The prophecy here is a reversal of fortunes, where the oppressors would not enjoy the fruits of their unjust gains. This echoes the curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to not enjoying the benefits of one's labor. It serves as a reminder of God's justice and the futility of wealth gained through unrighteous means.<p><b>you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted</b><br>Vineyards symbolize prosperity and blessing in the Bible (<a href="/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>). However, the oppressors' vineyards, planted through exploitation, would not yield joy for them. This is reminiscent of the curse in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>, where vineyards are planted but not enjoyed. It underscores the biblical principle that true prosperity comes from righteousness, not exploitation. This also foreshadows the ultimate justice and restoration found in Christ, who brings true peace and prosperity (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.

God is not acting arbitrarily; He is responding to proven rebellion. Just as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a> warns that disobedience brings curses, so here the verdict flows directly from the evidence. Amos is reminding the people that the covenant&#8217;s blessings and curses are literal realities&#8212;promises God fully intends to keep.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you trample on the poor</b><p>The primary charge is active oppression, not mere neglect. <a href="/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14&#8211;15</a> shows the same accusation: &#8220;What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor?&#8221; Notice the picture language: trampling implies repeated, heavy-footed abuse. God&#8217;s concern for the vulnerable saturates Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>). When those under His name crush the weak, they misrepresent His character, and judgment becomes inevitable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and exact from him a tax of grain,</b><p>This specifies how the oppression took place&#8212;through unfair economic policies that stripped the needy of life-sustaining food. <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10&#8211;11</a> condemns dishonest scales; here the tactic is an inflated levy. <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a> forbids robbery, yet Israel institutionalized it. The Lord sees the ledgers and calls them theft, not &#8220;business.&#8221; His literal expectation is honest dealings (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will never live in the stone houses you have built;</b><p>Stone houses were luxury dwellings (<a href="/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). The builders assumed permanence, but God says otherwise. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a> predicts the same curse: &#8220;You will build a house, but you will not live in it.&#8221; The judgment fits the crime&#8212;those who denied shelter to the poor will lose their own. History confirms the prophecy: within a generation, Assyria swept in, and the grand homes sat vacant or were inhabited by foreigners (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will never drink the wine from the lush vineyards you have planted.</b><p>Again the curse mirrors the sin. Instead of feasting on prosperity gained through oppression, the people would watch foreigners consume it (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>). Vineyards require years of labor; losing the first harvest is a devastating reversal. The literal fulfillment underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word&#8212;both in blessing (<a href="/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>) and in judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a> declares that God sees social injustice, names it sin, and answers it with precise, covenant-based judgment. The wealthy trampled the poor and stole their grain; therefore their luxury houses and flourishing vineyards would profit them nothing. Scripture affirms that the Lord&#8217;s justice is not theoretical&#8212;He literally fulfills His promises, ensuring that oppression never has the last word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Burdens of wheat.--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Ye take gifts of sifted corn, as a contribution to your own luxury, and which the poor man was not bound to offer, and only would offer to purchase your good will.
