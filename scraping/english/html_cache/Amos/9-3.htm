In biblical history, it is the site of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). The reference to hiding atop Carmel suggests an attempt to escape divine judgment by seeking refuge in a place of natural strength and beauty. This phrase emphasizes the futility of trying to escape God's omnipresence and judgment, as even the most fortified and remote locations cannot shield one from His reach.<p><b>there I will track them and seize them</b><br>This phrase underscores God's omniscience and omnipotence. The imagery of God tracking and seizing those who hide reflects His role as a divine hunter who cannot be eluded. It conveys the certainty of divine justice and the impossibility of escaping accountability. This is consistent with other scriptures that affirm God's ability to see all actions and intentions (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>).<p><b>and though they hide from Me at the bottom of the sea</b><br>The sea, often seen as a place of chaos and mystery in ancient Near Eastern culture, represents the ultimate attempt to escape. The idea of hiding at the bottom of the sea suggests going to extreme lengths to avoid divine scrutiny. This reflects the belief that no depth or distance can separate one from God's presence, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-9.htm">Psalm 139:9-10</a>.<p><b>there I will command the serpent to bite them</b><br>The serpent is a symbol of danger and judgment. In biblical literature, serpents often represent evil or instruments of divine punishment (Genesis 3, <a href="/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>). The command for the serpent to bite those hiding at the sea's bottom illustrates God's control over creation and His ability to use it to execute judgment. This imagery reinforces the theme of inescapable divine retribution and serves as a warning of the consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver messages of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/carmel.htm">Carmel</a></b><br>A mountain range in Israel known for its lush vegetation and strategic significance.

I would not have been prompted to place 'the top of Carmel' third in such a series of hiding places, yet I can fully appreciate the comparison from my own experience. Ascending from the south, we followed a wild, narrow wady overhung by trees, bushes, and tangled creepers, through which my guide thought we could get up to the top; but it became absolutely impracticable, and we were obliged to find our way back again. And even after we reached the summit, it was so rough and broken in some places, and the thorn bushes so thickset and sharp, that our clothes were torn and our hands and faces severely lacerated; nor could I see my guide at times ten steps ahead of me. From such biblical intimations, we may believe that Carmel was not very thickly inhabited" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' Central Palestine, p. 237, etc.).
