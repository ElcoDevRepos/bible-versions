In the context of Amos, the prophet addresses the Israelites, who were guilty of social injustices and idolatry. The call to "seek good" aligns with the broader biblical theme of choosing righteousness over sin, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>, where Moses sets before the people life and prosperity versus death and destruction. The Hebrew word for "seek" implies a diligent and intentional pursuit, suggesting that righteousness requires active effort. This call to seek good is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to overcome evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>).<p><b>so that you may live</b><br>The promise of life is both physical and spiritual. In the historical context, Amos warns of impending judgment on Israel due to their sins, and repentance could avert disaster. The concept of life here is not merely survival but a flourishing existence under God's blessing. This echoes the covenantal promises found in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience leads to life and prosperity. Spiritually, this foreshadows the New Testament teaching of eternal life through Christ, who is the embodiment of goodness and life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>And the LORD, the God of Hosts, will be with you</b><br>This assurance of God's presence is contingent upon the people's repentance and pursuit of good. The title "God of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power, often associated with His role as a divine warrior leading the heavenly armies. This reflects the covenantal promise of God's presence with His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>, where God assures Moses of His presence. The presence of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, culminating in the New Testament with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>).<p><b>as you have claimed</b><br>This phrase suggests a discrepancy between the people's profession and their actions. The Israelites claimed to be God's people, yet their lives did not reflect His character. This hypocrisy is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where outward religious observance is condemned when not accompanied by justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for similar hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). The call to genuine faithfulness is a reminder that true relationship with God is evidenced by a life that seeks good and shuns evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver a message of judgment and repentance to the northern kingdom of Israel during a time of prosperity and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and social injustice, prompting Amos's call for repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god_of_hosts.htm">The LORD God of Hosts</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts where God is portrayed as a divine warrior or leader of heavenly armies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethel.htm">Bethel</a></b><br>A significant religious center in Israel, often associated with idolatrous practices that Amos condemns.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_the_lord.htm">Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A prophetic term used by Amos and other prophets to describe a future time of divine judgment and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_righteous_living.htm">The Call to Righteous Living</a></b><br>Amos's message emphasizes the importance of seeking good and rejecting evil as a pathway to life and divine presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_conditional_promise.htm">The Conditional Promise</a></b><br>The promise of God's presence is conditional upon the people's pursuit of good, highlighting the relationship between obedience and divine blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Amos warns that claiming God's presence without genuine repentance and righteous living is futile.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_social_justice.htm">The Role of Social Justice</a></b><br>Seeking good involves addressing social injustices, a recurring theme in Amos's prophecies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection_and_repentance.htm">Personal Reflection and Repentance</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to examine their lives, repent of evil, and actively pursue good in their daily actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Amos_5_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Amos 5:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_pursue_good_daily_avoid_evil.htm">How can we "seek good and not evil" in our daily lives today?

God is not asking for passive agreement with moral principles; He wants wholehearted pursuit of what He calls &#8220;good.&#8221; That means aligning thoughts, choices, and habits with His revealed will. Consider how <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> urges us &#8220;to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God,&#8221; and how <a href="/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a> tells us, &#8220;Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.&#8221; Seeking good looks like:<p>&#8226; Choosing integrity even when shortcuts seem easier (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Championing justice for the vulnerable (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Cultivating kindness in everyday relationships (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not evil</b><p>God&#8217;s people must actively reject whatever He calls wicked. <a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a> says, &#8220;Turn away from evil and do good,&#8221; echoing Amos&#8217; contrast. Resisting evil involves:<p>&#8226; Steering clear of practices God condemns (<a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Keeping a vigilant watch over media, attitudes, and conversations that normalize sin (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Confronting wrongdoing instead of tolerating it (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may live</b><p>Obedience carries a promise: life. In Amos&#8217; day it meant physical preservation from looming judgment; for believers today it still means enjoying God&#8217;s favor, flourishing, and eternal life in Christ. <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a> links choosing life with loving and obeying God, and Jesus expands it: &#8220;I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Walking in goodness safeguards our lives from the destructive consequences of sin and ushers us into God&#8217;s abundant provision.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the LORD, the God of Hosts</b><p>This title stresses both covenant closeness (&#8220;the LORD&#8221;) and cosmic authority (&#8220;God of Hosts,&#8221; Commander of angel armies). He is the same LORD who stood with David against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>) and who fights for His people (<a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>). The One exhorting Israel is no regional deity; He rules every realm and has power to bless or discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be with you</b><p>God&#8217;s presence is the greatest gift. It brings protection (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), guidance (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>), and unshakeable confidence (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). Yet the promise here is conditional: His abiding presence accompanies those who seek good and shun evil. It is not automatic; obedience invites fellowship, while rebellion drives a wedge (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as you have claimed</b><p>Israel boasted, &#8220;The LORD is with us,&#8221; but their lifestyles denied it (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>). God confronts that hollow claim, insisting that genuine fellowship must match confession. Jesus echoes this in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>, warning that not everyone who says &#8220;Lord, Lord&#8221; truly belongs to Him. Authentic faith produces obedience (<a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4-5</a>); mere slogans do not.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/5-14.htm">Amos 5:14</a> calls for an active pursuit of God-defined goodness and a decisive rejection of evil.
