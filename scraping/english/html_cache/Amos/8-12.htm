In the context of ancient Israel, "sea to sea" could refer to the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Dead Sea to the east, symbolizing the entire land. The imagery of staggering indicates a lack of direction and purpose, reflecting the spiritual famine described earlier in the chapter. This can be seen as a judgment from God, where people are left without divine guidance due to their disobedience.<p><b>and roam from north to east</b><br>The mention of "north to east" further emphasizes the exhaustive search across the land. The northern kingdom of Israel and the eastern regions were significant in biblical history, often associated with invasions and exile. This roaming signifies a futile quest for spiritual truth and guidance, highlighting the severity of God's judgment. The directionality may also imply a search beyond traditional boundaries, indicating the extent of their desperation.<p><b>seeking the word of the LORD</b><br>The "word of the LORD" refers to divine revelation and guidance, which was delivered through prophets. In the historical context, the Israelites had often ignored or rejected prophetic messages, leading to a spiritual void. This phrase underscores the irony that in their time of need, they would seek what they had previously dismissed. It also points to the importance of God's word as a source of life and direction, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>.<p><b>but they will not find it</b><br>This is a sobering conclusion to the verse, indicating the consequences of persistent disobedience and rejection of God. The absence of God's word signifies a withdrawal of His presence and favor, leading to spiritual desolation. This can be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings, where the people experience the reality of life without divine guidance. It serves as a cautionary message about the importance of heeding God's word while it is available, echoing themes found in other prophetic books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.

The verse portrays frantic movement across the land, yet no word from heaven. Divine revelation is a gracious gift; when spurned, its withdrawal leaves people aimless, anxious, and under judgment. The remedy is to heed God&#8217;s word now, while it is freely offered through Scripture and faithful proclamation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They shall wander from sea to sea . . .</span>--Stagger and reel from east to west to find one seer who knows the mind of the Lord: they shall not find one. The reference to the east here has an instructive parallel in <a href="/isaiah/2-6.htm" title="Therefore you have forsaken your people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.">Isaiah 2:6</a>, where the house of Jacob is enounced as being "full of the east." Probably Delitzsch is right in interpreting the east there to mean Arabia as inclusive of the whole tract from the Sinaitic peninsula to the banks of the Euphrates. The north would mean Ph?nicia and Aram. From these districts the distracted superstitious Hebrew sought vain help in idolatrous forms of divination.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall wander;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they shall reel.</span> The verse implies the eagerness of their unsatisfied desire, which seeks everywhere for the revelation which for their sin is denied them. <span class="cmt_word">From sea to sea.</span> This expression is taken, by Keil and others, to mean here "all the world over," as <a href="/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>; <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>; but it is probably used by the prophet in a more restricted sense, as it would not be natural for him to refer in the first place to the seeking of the words of God beyond the limits of the Holy Land. Therefore "from sea to sea" means from the Sea of Galilee or the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean; and <span class="cmt_word">from the north even to the east</span> - from the north round again to the east, the south not being mentioned, because there alone was the true worship of God to be found, and they refused to seek it there (Pusey). Of course, according to the wide scope taken by prophecy, which is not exhausted by one fulfilment, we may see here the fate of the Jews to the present time hopelessly seeking Messiah and the Word of God, never finding that which they once recklessly rejected.
