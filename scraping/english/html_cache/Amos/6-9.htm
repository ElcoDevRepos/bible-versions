The number ten often symbolizes completeness or fullness in biblical numerology, indicating that even a complete group of survivors will not escape the impending judgment. The context of Amos is a prophecy against Israel, warning of the consequences of their complacency and injustice. The mention of "one house" may imply a place of refuge or safety, yet even this will not protect them from divine retribution. This reflects the severity of God's judgment, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/24-6.htm">Isaiah 24:6</a>, where widespread devastation is prophesied.<p><b>they too will die</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the inevitability and totality of the judgment. The certainty of death for these men highlights the inescapable nature of God's wrath due to Israel's persistent sin and rebellion. Historically, this can be connected to the Assyrian invasion, which led to the fall of Samaria and the exile of the Israelites. Theologically, it serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. This theme of inevitable judgment is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>, where God's judgment begins with His own people. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come at the end of times, as described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.

Isaiah mocked those who &#8220;enter the rocks and hide in the dust&#8221; from the Lord&#8217;s terror (<a href="/isaiah/2-10.htm">Isaiah 2:10</a>), and Ezekiel foretold that fugitives would meet sword or plague whether &#8220;inside&#8221; or &#8220;outside&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/7-15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>).

Nine have fallen victims. Fathers and brothers are all gone, and the uncle comes in as the funereal burner, to carry out the corpse to the pyre, and finds in the innermost parts of the house the tenth victim of the fell disease yet alive. A hurried word or two passes between them: "Is there yet another with thee?" and the answer comes, "Not one." Then shall he say "Hush!" The lonely sufferer begins to curse the Lord for His judgments, or it may be he begins to call upon the Name of the Lord when it is too late, when, as a finishing touch of darkest gloom and despair, he is interrupted by a warning not to stir up Jehovah's wrath in this day of His visitation by even mentioning His name. This and one other passage (<a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1Samuel 31:12</a>) imply that under special circumstances the Hebrews burned their dead.
