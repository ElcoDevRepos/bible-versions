It underscores the authority and seriousness of the pronouncement, a common introduction in prophetic literature.<p><b>For three transgressions of Judah, even four,</b><br>The formula "for three transgressions, even four" is a Hebrew idiom indicating a fullness or completeness of sin. It suggests that Judah's sins are numerous and have reached a tipping point. This pattern is used throughout Amos to indicate that the sins are not isolated incidents but a persistent pattern.<p><b>I will not revoke My judgment,</b><br>God's decision is firm and irrevocable. This reflects the justice of God, who must address sin. It also highlights the seriousness of Judah's actions, as divine patience has been exhausted.<p><b>because they reject the Law of the LORD</b><br>Judah's primary sin is spiritual apostasy, rejecting the Torah, which was central to their covenant relationship with God. This rejection is not merely a failure to follow rules but a turning away from the covenantal relationship established at Sinai.<p><b>and fail to keep His statutes;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the active disobedience to God's commands. The statutes refer to specific laws given to guide the moral and religious life of Israel. Their failure to keep these statutes indicates a willful neglect of their covenant obligations.<p><b>they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked.</b><br>This points to the influence of false teachings and idolatry that have been perpetuated through generations. It suggests a historical pattern of disobedience and highlights the cultural and familial influences that have led Judah away from true worship. This connects to the broader biblical theme of generational sin and the need for repentance and return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of judgment to Israel and surrounding nations, including Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is delivering a message of judgment through Amos.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law_of_the_lord.htm">The Law of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the divine instructions given to Israel, which Judah has rejected.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>The ancestors of the people of Judah, who also strayed from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rejecting_god's_law.htm">The Seriousness of Rejecting God's Law</a></b><br>Judah's rejection of God's law is not a trivial matter; it leads to divine judgment.
