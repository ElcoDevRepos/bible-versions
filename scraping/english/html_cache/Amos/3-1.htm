The use of "hear" emphasizes the importance of listening to God's word, a common prophetic call. The phrase "the LORD has spoken" underscores the authority and certainty of the message, as it comes directly from God. The context is a prophetic oracle, where God communicates through Amos, a shepherd and fig tree farmer called to prophesy to Israel. The phrase "against you" indicates a message of condemnation, highlighting the seriousness of Israel's sins.<p><b>O children of Israel</b><br>This term refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who became the twelve tribes. It emphasizes their identity as God's chosen people, with whom He established a covenant. Historically, this period is marked by Israel's division into two kingdoms: Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom). Amos primarily addresses the northern kingdom, which had fallen into idolatry and social injustice. The phrase serves as a reminder of their special relationship with God and the responsibilities that come with it.<p><b>against the whole family</b><br>This phrase expands the scope of the message to include all the tribes of Israel, not just a select few. It underscores the unity of the nation under God's covenant, despite the political division into two kingdoms. The term "family" suggests a collective identity and shared responsibility. It also implies that the judgment is comprehensive, affecting every part of the nation. This collective accountability is a recurring theme in the prophets, who often call the entire community to repentance.<p><b>that I brought up out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered them from slavery in Egypt. It serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and the basis for His covenant with Israel. The Exodus is frequently referenced in the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's power and love. By invoking this event, the message highlights Israel's ingratitude and unfaithfulness despite God's past deliverance. It also serves as a warning that the same God who delivered them can also bring judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment to Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, who were chosen by God as His covenant people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, a foundational moment in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_call.htm">God's Sovereign Call</a></b><br>God initiates the relationship with His people.

God is not whispering suggestions; He is summoning His covenant people to attention.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents hearing as the gateway to obedience. &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is One&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets echo the same plea: &#8220;Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus upholds the pattern: &#8220;Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them will be like a wise man&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>).<p>Refusal to hear is never presented as a neutral act; it is the first step toward rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the LORD has spoken</b><p>The phrase grounds the message in divine authority. Amos is not voicing personal opinion; he conveys the very words of the covenant-keeping God.<p>&#8226; &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>); what He speaks is factual, final, and binding.<p>&#8226; His word always accomplishes the purpose for which He sends it (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>Because the Speaker is infallible, the audience cannot dismiss or dilute what follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against you, O children of Israel</b><p>The oracle is confrontational. The people addressed bear a covenant name and yet stand under indictment.<p>&#8226; Hosea delivers a parallel charge: &#8220;The LORD has a case against the inhabitants of the land&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later Stephen reminds Israel, &#8220;You always resist the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment begins with the house of God (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>Possession of a privileged status never shields from accountability; it increases it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the whole family</b><p>God targets every tribe, clan, and household. No segment can claim exemption.<p>&#8226; Jacob was promised, &#8220;A nation and a company of nations shall come from you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). That entire &#8220;family&#8221; is now summoned.<p>&#8226; At Sinai the Lord declared, &#8220;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The collective identity carries collective responsibility.<p>Unity before God means a shared blessing when faithful&#8212;and a shared reckoning when unfaithful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that I brought up out of the land of Egypt</b><p>The verse ends by recalling the defining act of redemption.<p>&#8226; &#8220;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The exodus was literal, miraculous, and foundational; God&#8217;s mighty hand and outstretched arm (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>) secured Israel&#8217;s freedom.<p>&#8226; Paul later draws the parallel for believers: &#8220;Our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>).<p>Remembering redemption heightens the tragedy of rebellion; the God who saved has every right to judge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/3-1.htm">Amos 3:1</a> is a summons to attentive hearing, anchored in the authority of the LORD, directed squarely at His covenant people, embracing every member of the national family, and framed by the memory of a literal, historic deliverance from Egypt. The verse underscores that privileged relationship intensifies responsibility: the God who graciously redeemed Israel now speaks a word of accountability they dare not ignore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Children of Israel</span> rather than "house of Israel" is a phrase not so usual in Amos.
