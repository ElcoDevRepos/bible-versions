The captivity serves as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a>, where God warns Israel of the consequences of turning away from Him. The driving into captivity signifies God's judgment and the use of foreign nations as instruments of His divine justice.<p><b>there I will command the sword to slay them</b><br>Even in captivity, the Israelites would not escape God's judgment. The sword represents ongoing punishment and the continuation of divine retribution. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to execute judgment wherever His people are found. The sword is often a symbol of war and destruction, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>, where God declares judgment upon all nations.<p><b>I will fix My eyes upon them for harm and not for good.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's active involvement in the judgment process. The fixing of God's eyes suggests His unwavering attention and determination to bring about the consequences of Israel's sin. This is a reversal of the blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where God's face is turned toward His people for peace and favor. Here, the focus is on harm, emphasizing the seriousness of Israel's rebellion. The concept of God&#8217;s eyes being upon someone is also seen in <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, but in a positive light, showing the stark contrast when God&#8217;s favor is withdrawn.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which had turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivity.htm">Captivity</a></b><br>Refers to the impending exile of the Israelites due to their disobedience and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The foreign nations, particularly Assyria, that God would use as instruments of judgment against Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Symbolizes the instrument of God's judgment, often representing war and destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Certainty of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is inescapable for those who persist in sin.
