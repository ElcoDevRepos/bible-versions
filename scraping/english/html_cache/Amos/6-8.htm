In biblical times, swearing by oneself was the highest form of oath, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. God, being the ultimate authority, swears by Himself, indicating the unchangeable nature of His decree. This reflects His sovereignty and the gravity of the impending judgment.<p><b>the LORD, the God of Hosts, has declared</b><br>The title "God of Hosts" underscores God's supreme command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority. This title is often used in contexts of judgment and warfare, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>. It serves as a reminder of God's ability to execute His will against any nation or power.<p><b>I abhor Jacob&#8217;s pride</b><br>"Jacob" refers to the nation of Israel, and "pride" indicates their arrogance and self-reliance, which God finds detestable. This pride is a recurring theme in the prophets, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>, where human pride is contrasted with God's majesty. The Israelites' pride led them away from dependence on God, resulting in moral and spiritual decay.<p><b>and detest his citadels</b><br>Citadels symbolize the strength and security of a city. In this context, they represent Israel's misplaced trust in their own defenses and wealth. Archaeological findings in ancient Israelite cities reveal fortified structures, indicating a reliance on physical security. God's detestation of these citadels signifies His disapproval of their false sense of security.<p><b>so I will deliver up the city and everything in it</b><br>This phrase foretells the coming judgment and destruction. The "city" likely refers to Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Historical records and archaeological evidence confirm the Assyrian conquest of Samaria in 722 BC, fulfilling this prophecy. The totality of the destruction ("everything in it") underscores the completeness of God's judgment, similar to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah as described in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD</a></b><br>The sovereign and covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, often used to denote the collective people of God, descended from Jacob, the patriarch.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_hosts.htm">The God of Hosts</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's supreme authority over the heavenly armies and all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/citadels.htm">Citadels</a></b><br>Fortified structures symbolizing human pride and false security, often associated with wealth and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Likely referring to Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, known for its opulence and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God swears by Himself, underscoring His ultimate authority and the certainty of His judgment.

Since there is no authority higher than God, He swears by His own unchanging character (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>).<p>- Swearing &#8220;by Himself&#8221; also highlights His truthfulness: &#8220;it is impossible for God to lie&#8221; (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>). Israel cannot hope that this warning will fade or be revoked; the oath makes the judgment irrevocable.<p>- The gravity of an oath from the Almighty should arrest any sense of complacency in the hearer, much as it did when God swore regarding the wilderness generation (<a href="/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lord, the God of Hosts, has declared</b><p>- &#8220;The LORD, the God of Hosts&#8221; couples His covenant name with His title as commander of heaven&#8217;s armies (<a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>). This is not a distant deity but the very One who brought Israel out of Egypt and now must confront her rebellion.<p>- The phrase &#8220;has declared&#8221; reminds us that every prophetic word carries divine authority (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). God&#8217;s announcement is not a prediction but a decree; it will happen because the Sovereign LORD has said so.<p>- By invoking the &#8220;hosts,&#8221; God hints that the coming judgment will be executed with overwhelming power (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I abhor Jacob&#8217;s pride</b><p>- &#8220;Jacob&#8221; stands for the northern kingdom of Israel, once humble but now proud. God &#8220;abhors&#8221; the arrogance that has replaced gratitude (<a href="/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/7-10.htm">Hosea 7:10</a>).<p>- Their pride shows up in self-congratulation over material prosperity (<a href="/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4&#8211;6</a>) and in a refusal to repent despite repeated warnings (<a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-11</a>).<p>- Scripture consistently links pride with imminent downfall: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Israel&#8217;s confidence in her own achievements is the very thing that provokes divine displeasure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And detest his citadels</b><p>- The fortified palaces of Samaria symbolize military security and accumulated wealth (<a href="/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). God &#8220;detests&#8221; them because they have become monuments to exploitation (<a href="/amos/3-10.htm">Amos 3:10</a>) and false trust (<a href="/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10-11</a>).<p>- These strongholds fostered a sense of invincibility, yet God had already warned that enemy nations would break down the defenses built on injustice (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52</a>).<p>- Rich architecture cannot shield a people from the judgment of the One who &#8220;laughs&#8221; at earthly fortifications (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I will deliver up the city and everything in it</b><p>- The result of divine abhorrence is decisive: God will hand the entire city over to its enemies (<a href="/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>). History records this fulfillment when Assyria captured Samaria and exiled Israel in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>).<p>- &#8220;Everything in it&#8221; means no partial loss; possessions, palaces, and people alike fall under the judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>).<p>- The pattern matches other biblical judgments: when a society&#8217;s pride hardens into unrepentance, God removes the things in which it boasts (<a href="/daniel/5-20.htm">Daniel 5:20-21</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-7.htm">Revelation 18:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a> presents an unbreakable oath from the Sovereign LORD of hosts: because Israel&#8217;s pride and false security have replaced humble dependence on Him, He will hand the entire city over to its enemies. God&#8217;s own reputation guarantees the certainty of this judgment. The verse calls every generation to reject arrogant self-reliance, remember that no earthly stronghold can shield from divine justice, and find true security only in humble obedience to the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/amos/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">By himself</span>.--Literally, <span class= "ital">by His soul.</span> Jehovah swears by His life or soul because He could swear by no greater--the eternal "I Am."

In <a href="/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a> the phrase is used for God Himself; not, however, in either passage God's absolute perfection or objective glory, but the thoughts, sometimes wise, sometimes base, which men have entertained about Him. From the context we infer that the splendid shrine of Samaria, with its unacceptable offerings and calf-worship, is here meant. The reference to the coming destruction of buildings great and small (<a href="/amos/6-11.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.">Amos 6:11</a>) lends colour to this interpretation.
