His name means "burden" or "burden-bearer," which is fitting given the weighty messages he delivers. Unlike other prophets, Amos was not a professional prophet or priest but was called by God to deliver His message. This highlights the theme that God can use anyone to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>who was among the sheepherders of Tekoa&#8212;</b><br>Amos was a sheepherder, indicating his humble origins. Tekoa was a small town located about 10 miles south of Jerusalem in the region of Judah. This rural background suggests that Amos was familiar with the hardships of agrarian life, which is reflected in his vivid imagery and metaphors. His occupation also connects him to other biblical figures like David, who was also a shepherd before becoming king.<p><b>what he saw concerning Israel</b><br>The phrase "what he saw" indicates that Amos received visions from God. These visions were concerning Israel, the northern kingdom, despite Amos being from Judah. This cross-border prophecy underscores the unity of God's people and His concern for all tribes of Israel. The content of these visions includes judgments against Israel for their social injustices and idolatry.<p><b>two years before the earthquake,</b><br>The earthquake mentioned here is a significant historical event, corroborated by archaeological findings in the region. It serves as a chronological marker, emphasizing the urgency and authenticity of Amos's message. The earthquake is also referenced in <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>, indicating its lasting impact on the collective memory of the people.<p><b>in the days when Uzziah was king of Judah</b><br>Uzziah's reign in Judah was marked by prosperity and military success, but also by pride and eventual downfall (2 Chronicles 26). This period of prosperity led to complacency and moral decay, setting the stage for Amos's warnings. Uzziah's reign provides a backdrop of relative stability in Judah, contrasting with the spiritual decline Amos addresses.<p><b>and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel.</b><br>Jeroboam II's reign in Israel was characterized by economic prosperity and territorial expansion (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>). However, this prosperity was accompanied by social injustice, idolatry, and corruption, which Amos vehemently condemns. The mention of Jeroboam highlights the moral and spiritual issues in Israel, despite outward success. This context underscores the prophetic theme that true security and blessing come from obedience to God, not merely economic or military strength.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet and sheep breeder from Tekoa, called by God to deliver His message to Israel.

Outward prosperity can mask inward decay&#8212;a major theme in Amos (<a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s call came &#8220;in the year that King Uzziah died&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), linking Amos and Isaiah to the same moral climate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam II ruled when Israel reached its zenith of wealth and territory (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>).

The ground of the awful threatenings is the word of Jehovah made known to the prophet. The reason for the doom predicted on such high authority, is the resistance and cruelty that were offered by these nations to the theocratic people, and, still more, their own moral offences, condemned by universal conscience. The denunciations begin with a judgment upon <span class= "ital">Syria,</span> the age-long enemy of Judah, sometimes confederate with Israel. Then he passes to Philistia, which had been a thorn in the side of Israel and Judah from the days of the Judges till his own. Then he directs his gaze upon Ph?nician cities, the emporium of the most extensive commerce in the world, Next he passes in review other three tribes, or nations, more closely related to Israel in blood, language, and proximity, and which, nevertheless, had often manifested an undying hatred of the covenanted people. After this Judah, his own tribe, does not escape.
