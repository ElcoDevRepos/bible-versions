The mountains, often seen as symbols of strength and stability, are crafted by God, highlighting His supreme authority over creation. In biblical times, mountains were also places of divine revelation, such as Mount Sinai where Moses received the Law (Exodus 19). This underscores God's role as the ultimate source of wisdom and law.<p><b>who creates the wind</b><br>The wind is a symbol of God's invisible yet powerful presence. In Hebrew, the word for wind, "ruach," can also mean spirit, indicating the divine breath of life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). This creation of the wind signifies God's control over the natural world and His ability to influence events and people, as seen in the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>and reveals His thoughts to man</b><br>God's revelation to humanity is a central theme in the Bible. Through prophets like Amos, God communicates His will and intentions. This phrase highlights the importance of prophecy and the role of prophets as God's messengers. It also points to the ultimate revelation of God through Jesus Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>who turns the dawn to darkness</b><br>This imagery of altering the natural order serves as a metaphor for God's judgment. It reflects the theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophetic books, where God warns of impending judgment due to Israel's disobedience. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the darkness that covered the land during Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>).<p><b>and strides on the heights of the earth</b><br>This expression conveys God's majesty and omnipresence. The "heights of the earth" symbolize places of power and authority, suggesting that God is above all earthly rulers and powers. It echoes the imagery of God as a warrior and king, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>, where God is described as the "great King over all the earth."<p><b>the LORD, the God of Hosts, is His name.</b><br>This declaration affirms God's identity and His command over the heavenly armies. "LORD" (Yahweh) is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His faithfulness to His people. "God of Hosts" underscores His role as the leader of the angelic forces, ready to execute His will. This title is a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the assurance of His protection and justice, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from their enemies (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.

This he does sometimes by the stings of conscience, sometimes by inspiring his prophets to declare men's secret motives and the real state of their heart (see <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, l0; and comp. <a href="/1_john/3-20.htm">1 John 3:20</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Annuntians homini eloquium suum</span>, where <span class="accented">eloquium is</span> equivalent to <span class="accented">cognitatio</span>. The LXX., with some change of letters, has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "proclaiming unto men his Christ" - a reading which supports the misinterpretation of "his thought" as meaning God's thought, Christ being regarded as the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of God. Many of the Fathers have seen here a prophesy of the Messiah. See Tirinus and Corn. a Lapide on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">That maketh the morning darkness.</span> Keil, after Calvin, takes these words as asyndeton for "the morning dawn and darkness." So the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "making morning and gloom." This would be simply a further instance of God's creative power. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">faciens matutinam nebulam</span>; and it seems probable (comp. <a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>; <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>) that the clause means that the Lord turns the dawn into darkness. This may refer to the action of clouds or an eclipse; or it may be said metaphorically of prosperity and adversity. <span class="cmt_word">Treadeth upon the high places of the earth.</span> An anthropomorphic representation of the might and majesty of God, who governs all things, and has the loftiest in perfect subjection (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>; <a href="/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord,</span> Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, covenant God, is he who in these things manifests himself, and therefore his threats are not to be despised (<a href="/amos/5-8.htm">Amos 5:8</a>). In the prophet's view the laws and powers of nature have their scope in executing God's commands. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He who forms</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3335.htm">Strong's 3335: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mould into a, form, as a, potter, to determine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the mountains,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2022.htm">Strong's 2022: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mountain, hill, hill country</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who creates</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
