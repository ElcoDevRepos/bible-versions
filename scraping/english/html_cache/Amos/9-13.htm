The use of "Behold" serves to capture attention, indicating the importance of the message. The phrase "the days are coming" is often used in prophetic literature to signal a future time of fulfillment, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a> and <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>. It underscores God's sovereign control over history and His ability to bring about His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;when the plowman will overtake the reaper&#8221;</b><br>This imagery suggests a time of unprecedented agricultural abundance. In ancient Israel, the agricultural cycle was well-defined, with specific times for plowing, sowing, and reaping. The idea that the plowman will overtake the reaper indicates a supernaturally abundant harvest, where the land is so fruitful that the next planting season begins before the previous harvest is completed. This reflects the blessings promised in <a href="/leviticus/26-5.htm">Leviticus 26:5</a>, where God assures Israel of prosperity if they follow His commandments.<p><b>and the treader of grapes, the sower of seed.</b><br>Continuing the theme of abundance, this phrase suggests that the grape harvest will be so plentiful that those treading grapes will still be at work when it is time to sow new seeds. This reversal of the normal order highlights the extraordinary nature of the blessing. It also symbolizes a time of joy and celebration, as wine is often associated with gladness in the Bible (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The imagery points to a future restoration and blessing for God's people.<p><b>The mountains will drip with sweet wine,</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize stability and permanence. The idea of mountains dripping with sweet wine conveys a picture of overflowing abundance and prosperity. This is a hyperbolic expression to emphasize the richness of the blessings to come. In <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>, a similar image is used to describe the future blessings for Israel, indicating a time of restoration and divine favor.<p><b>with which all the hills will flow.</b><br>The flowing of wine from the hills further emphasizes the theme of abundance and prosperity. Hills, like mountains, are often seen as places of refuge and strength. The imagery of wine flowing from the hills suggests that the blessings of God will be widespread and affect every part of the land. This can be seen as a foretaste of the Messianic age, where God's kingdom will bring peace and prosperity, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>. The abundance of wine also serves as a type of the joy and celebration found in the presence of Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the northern kingdom of Israel during a time of prosperity and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and the one declaring the promise of restoration and abundance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which was experiencing economic prosperity but was spiritually and morally corrupt, leading to God's judgment and eventual promise of restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plowman_and_reaper.htm">Plowman and Reaper</a></b><br>Symbolic figures representing agricultural workers.
