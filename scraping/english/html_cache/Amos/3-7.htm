It reflects the biblical theme that God is in control of history and events. The use of "Lord GOD" (YHWH Elohim) underscores His authority and covenant relationship with Israel. This aligns with other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, highlighting His omniscience and omnipotence.<p><b>without revealing His plan</b><br>God's transparency in His dealings with humanity is highlighted here. The term "revealing" suggests that God communicates His intentions and purposes, often through divine revelation. This is consistent with the biblical narrative where God shares His plans with key figures, such as Abraham in <a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17-19</a>, where God reveals His intentions regarding Sodom and Gomorrah. It underscores the idea that God desires a relationship with His people, where they are informed and involved in His divine purposes.<p><b>to His servants the prophets</b><br>Prophets in the Old Testament were chosen individuals who served as God's mouthpieces. They were often called to deliver messages of warning, guidance, and hope to the people of Israel. This phrase indicates the special role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel received divine revelations that were crucial for guiding the nation. This also points to the continuity of God's communication, as seen in the New Testament with John the Baptist and ultimately Jesus Christ, who is considered the ultimate prophet, priest, and king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, a small town in Judah, who was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The Lord GOD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who communicates His will and plans through His chosen prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals chosen by God to receive and communicate His divine revelations to the people.
