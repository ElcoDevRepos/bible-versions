It points to a specific period when God will act decisively, often associated with the "Day of the Lord" in prophetic literature, indicating a time of judgment and restoration.<p><b>I will restore the fallen tent of David</b><br>The "fallen tent of David" refers to the kingdom of Israel, particularly the Davidic dynasty, which had experienced decline and division. This restoration implies a return to the unity and strength of David's reign. It also foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, a descendant of David, who will establish an eternal kingdom. This is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16-17</a>, where James cites this prophecy in the context of the inclusion of Gentiles in the church.<p><b>I will repair its gaps</b><br>The imagery of repairing gaps suggests mending breaches in the kingdom, both physically and spiritually. This can be seen as addressing the divisions and moral failings that led to Israel's downfall. It implies a comprehensive restoration that includes justice, righteousness, and unity among God's people.<p><b>restore its ruins</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete renewal of what was once destroyed. It suggests a transformation from desolation to vitality, reflecting God's power to bring life and order out of chaos. This restoration is not just physical but also spiritual, pointing to a renewed covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and rebuild it as in the days of old</b><br>The reference to "the days of old" evokes the golden age of Israel under King David and Solomon, a time of prosperity, peace, and faithfulness to God. This rebuilding signifies a return to the original intent and purpose of God's covenant with Israel, highlighting themes of redemption and hope for a future where God's promises are fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, Amos was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the northern kingdom of Israel during a time of prosperity and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, David is a central figure in the Bible, known for his heart for God and his establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.

The apostle uses it to show that there was a prophetic promise that after the dispersion of Israel the power and throne of David should be so re-established that it might be a rallying-place of the rest of the nations, "that the residue of men should seek after the Lord" (LXX. "me"). The clause which is quoted shows that the LXX. made their translation from a different Hebrew text from ours, and probably an inferior one. The word for "men" (<span class= "ital">?d?m</span>) was read in place of <span class= "ital">Edom</span> in the Masoretic text. The rendering "seek" can also be accounted for by a slight modification of the Hebrew characters. The remarks of Dr. Stanley Leathes (<span class= "ital">Old Testament Prophecy,</span> p. 70) upon this passage are worthy of attention:--"The Greek text, which the apostle did not make, but found, lent itself even more forcibly than the Hebrew to the peculiar circumstances of the time . . . That he was not speaking critically we are willing to admit, but are we sure that he was bound to do so? At all events, our criticism will best display itself in judging his words according to his standard, and not according to one which, it is plain, he did not follow."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-15.</span> - Part IV.

The passage is quoted by St. James (<a href="/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16, 27</a>), mostly from the Greek, in confirmation of the doctrine that the Church of God is open to all, whether Jew or Gentile. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle (</span><span class="accented">sukkah</span>): <span class="accented">hut</span>, or <span class="accented">tent</span> (as <a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>); no palace now, but fallen to low esthete, a "little house" (<a href="/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>). The prophet refers probably to the fall of the kingdom of David in the ruin wrought by the Chaldeans. Interpreted spiritually, the passage shadows forth the universal Church of Christ, raised from that of the Jews. Pusey notes that in the Talmud Christ is called "the Son of the fallen." <span class="cmt_word">The breaches.</span> The house of David had sustained breaches under the hands of Jeroboam and Joash, and in the severance of the ten tribes at the hands of Assyriaus and Chaldees; these should be repaired. Unity should be restored, the captives should return, and another kingdom should be established under another David, the Messiah. Judah's temporary prosperity under Uzziah and Hezekiah would have been a totally inadequate fulfilment of the prophecy.
