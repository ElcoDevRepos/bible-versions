It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the following words are not merely human opinion but a direct communication from God. This underscores the seriousness of the message and the need for the audience to heed it.<p><b>As the shepherd snatches from the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear:</b><br>This imagery draws from the shepherding culture of ancient Israel, where shepherds were responsible for protecting their flocks from predators. The reference to a lion suggests a powerful and dangerous threat. The mention of "two legs or a piece of an ear" indicates minimal recovery, symbolizing a remnant or small portion saved from destruction. This reflects the dire situation of Israel, where only a small remnant will be preserved. The imagery also connects to David's experience as a shepherd (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-36</a>), highlighting the protective role of a shepherd, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>so the Israelites dwelling in Samaria will be rescued:</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, representing the political and spiritual center of the nation. The prophecy indicates that the Israelites will face severe judgment, with only a small remnant being saved. This reflects the historical context of the Assyrian invasion and the subsequent exile of the Northern Kingdom in 722 BC. The notion of rescue, albeit minimal, points to God's mercy and the preservation of a faithful remnant, a theme echoed throughout the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p><b>having just the corner of a bed or the cushion of a couch:</b><br>This phrase uses domestic imagery to convey the idea of incomplete rescue or survival. The "corner of a bed" and "cushion of a couch" suggest remnants of luxury or comfort, indicating that what remains after judgment is minimal and perhaps even trivial. This can be seen as a critique of the complacency and false security of the Israelites, who trusted in their wealth and comfort rather than in God. The imagery serves as a warning against placing trust in material possessions, a theme that resonates with Jesus' teachings on the dangers of wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Amos to deliver a message of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from Tekoa, called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites_in_samaria.htm">Israelites in Samaria</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, specifically those living in its capital, Samaria, who are facing impending judgment due to their sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>A metaphorical figure representing God's care and protection, but also His judgment, as He allows only a remnant to be saved.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lion.htm">Lion</a></b><br>Symbolizes the impending judgment and destruction that will come upon Israel, as a lion devours its prey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_judgment.htm">The Reality of Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and severe, as depicted by the lion's attack.

The verse reveals (1) God&#8217;s sovereign right to speak and act, (2) His willingness to discipline covenant breakers, and (3) His steadfast mercy in preserving a small remnant.

So below, <span class="cmt_word">shall be taken out;</span> <span class="accented">shall be rescued</span>. The usual explanation is that a shepherd attacks the lion which has seized one of his sheep (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34</a>, etc.), and rescues from it the most worthless parts - "a couple of shank bones or a bit, or tip, of an ear." But as an attack on a lion would be an abnormal act of courage on the part of a shepherd, and the comparison is with things likely and usual, it is probable that the meaning is that the shepherd finds only these poor remnants after the lion has left his prey. So such a poor remnant shall be rescued from the ten tribes of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">That dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed;</span> that sit at ease, lounging in the cosiest corner of the divan, an image of indolent ease and careless security in the face of impending judgment. <span class="cmt_word">And in Damascus in a couch;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">et in Damasci grabato</span>. The Syriac and Jewish Versions agree in considering the word "Damascus" to be a proper name. The other modern rendering takes it to mean the material which we call "damask," or something similar. Hence our Revised Version gives, "on the silken cushions of a bed;" and others, "on the damask of a couch." Dr. Pusey retains the old rendering, on the grounds that there is no evidence to prove that the manufactures for which Damascus was celebrated in after time existed at this period, its exports being then wine and white wool (<a href="/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), and that the Arabic word <span class="accented">dimakso</span> (which critics have cited as connected with the term "damask") has nothing to do with Damascus, and meant raw, not manufactured, "silk." He translates, "in Damascus, a couch," and explains this to mean that Damascus, which Jeroboam II had won for Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>), "was a canopied couch to them, in which they stayed themselves." This agrees with the ancient Jewish interpretation, which explains the clause to mean that the Israelites would some day depend for help on the Syrians represented by Damascus A third exposition, favoured by the Latin Vulgate, makes the words to mean, "on a couch of Damascus;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Syrian couch of a costly and luxurious nature. This comes to the same as the modern rendering given, above and seems to be the easiest explanation of the expression. The difficulty depends chiefly on the punctuation of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5da;</span>; or them may be some corruption in the text. What the LXX. meant by their rendering is problematical,<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "The children of Israel who dwell in Samaria in the presence of the tribe and in Damascus." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
