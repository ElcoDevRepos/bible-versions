It was one of the cities founded by Nimrod, as mentioned in <a href="/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>. The call to "see" suggests an examination of its fate, as it was a city that had experienced decline and judgment. This serves as a warning to Israel, emphasizing that even great cities can fall due to their sins.<p><b>go from there to the great Hamath;</b><br>Hamath was a significant city-state located in modern-day Syria. It was known for its strategic location and influence. Historically, Hamath had been a powerful kingdom, but it too faced conquest and subjugation. The reference to "the great Hamath" highlights its former prominence, serving as a reminder that no city is immune to downfall, reinforcing the message of impending judgment.<p><b>then go down to Gath of the Philistines.</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities and the home of Goliath. It was a symbol of Philistine power and opposition to Israel. By mentioning Gath, the text underscores the theme of divine judgment, as Gath had been conquered and diminished. This serves as a parallel to Israel's potential fate if they continue in disobedience.<p><b>Are you better than these kingdoms?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges Israel's sense of security and superiority. It implies that Israel, despite its covenant relationship with God, is not exempt from judgment if it follows the same path of sin and pride as these other nations. The question calls for introspection and humility, urging the Israelites to recognize their vulnerability.<p><b>Is their territory larger than yours?</b><br>This phrase highlights the comparative size and strength of these kingdoms. Despite their larger territories and resources, they were not spared from judgment. The implication is that Israel's smaller size does not guarantee safety or favor if they persist in their sinful ways. It serves as a warning that divine justice is impartial and based on righteousness, not size or power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/calneh.htm">Calneh</a></b><br>An ancient city, possibly located in Mesopotamia, known for its strength and prosperity.

Kalneh, the Kalno of <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>, the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Kulunu</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>), is here probably mentioned first because it is most easterly. It is identified by Kiepert with <span class= "ital">Holwan,</span> but its position is uncertain, though generally regarded as lying in the neighbourhood of the Greek Ctesiphon, on the Tigris. Hamath is the ancient Hittite city in the valley of the Orontes, and it had felt the strong hand of Jeroboam II. (<a href="/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 14:28</a>). We have no reason for believing that at this period the Assyrian power had destroyed the importance of these places, though the prophet may have regarded that issue as imminent. Hamath the Great (or Rabba; comp. <a href="/joshua/11-8.htm" title="And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them to great Zidon, and to Misrephothmaim, and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.">Joshua 11:8</a>), according to the inscriptions, sustained defeats from Salmanassar II. about 850 B.C. It was finally overthrown by Sargon in 720 B.C., who in his own boastful language "swept over its land like a flood." Gath, the home of Goliath, had probably lost its original importance. Uzziah destroyed it. Were Calno, Hamath, Gath, more important than Zion or Samaria? Then, says the prophet, do not expect in your opulence and self-satisfaction immunity from a worse doom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pass ye.</span> Go and compare your condition with that of other countries, from the furthest east to the north, to your own neighbours - has not God done more for you than for them?

As one of the oldest cities in the world, ranking with Babel, Erech, and Aecad, it was well known to the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Hamath the great;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;</span>. This was the principal city of Upper Syria, and a place of great importance. In after years it was called Epiphania, after Antiochus Epiphanes (<a href="/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). It fell in Sargon's reign, <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>; afterwards it lost its independence, and was incorporated in the Assyrian empire. <span class="cmt_word">Oath of the Philistines</span>. One of their five chief cities, and at one time the principal (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>). The site is placed by Porter at <span class="accented">Tell-es-Safi</span>, an isolated hill; standing above the bread valley of Elah, and "presenting on the north and west a white precipice of many hundred feet." Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 215, etc.) considers Gath to be the same city as Betogabra, Eleutheropolis, and the modern <span class="accented">Beth Jibrin</span>, which is some few miles south of <span class="accented">Tell Safi</span>. He thinks the site of Tell Sift is not adapted for the seat of a large city, and he saw few indications of ancient ruins there; whereas Beit Jibrin has in and around it the most wonderful remains of antiquity to be found in all Philistia. It had probably declined in importance at this time (see note on ch. 1:6), but its old reputation was still remembered. It was taken by Uzziah, but seems not to have remained long in his possession (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). In the year <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon reduced Ashdod and Garb, which he calls Gimtu Asdudim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Gath of the Ashdodites. <span class="cmt_word">Be they better?</span> Have they received more earthly prosperity at God's hands than you? Is their territory greater than yours? No. How ungrateful, then, are you for all my favours (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5-11</a>)! Schrader and Bickell regard the verse as an interpolation, grammatically, metrically, and chronologically inadmissible; but their arguments are not strong, and Ames makes no mention of the fate of these cities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Cross over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;i&#7687;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Calneh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;al&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3641.htm">Strong's 3641: </a> </span><span class="str2">Calneh -- a place in Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and see;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
