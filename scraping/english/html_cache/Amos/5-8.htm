The Pleiades and Orion are mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a> and <a href="/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>, emphasizing God's control over the cosmos. In ancient Near Eastern culture, these constellations were often associated with deities or mythological stories, but here they affirm the monotheistic belief that the God of Israel is the true creator of the universe. This underscores the futility of idol worship and calls the Israelites to recognize the one true God.<p><b>who turns darkness into dawn and darkens day into night</b><br>This phrase illustrates God's control over time and the natural order, echoing the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> where God separates light from darkness. It serves as a reminder of God's omnipotence and His ability to bring about change, both in the physical world and in the lives of His people. The cyclical nature of day and night also symbolizes the themes of judgment and redemption found throughout the book of Amos, where God warns of impending judgment but also offers hope for restoration.<p><b>who summons the waters of the sea and pours them over the face of the earth</b><br>This imagery reflects God's authority over the waters, reminiscent of the Genesis flood narrative and the parting of the Red Sea in Exodus. Water is often a symbol of chaos and judgment in the Bible, and God's control over it signifies His power to bring both destruction and salvation. This phrase may also allude to the blessings of rain and fertility, which were crucial for an agrarian society like Israel. It serves as a reminder of God's provision and the consequences of turning away from Him.<p><b>the LORD is His name&#8212;</b><br>This declaration affirms the identity of God as Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God of Israel. It emphasizes His uniqueness and the personal relationship He has with His people. The use of "LORD" in all capitals signifies the sacred name of God, which was revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. This phrase serves as a call to repentance, urging the Israelites to return to the worship of the one true God, who is both creator and sustainer. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's name and character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amos.htm">Amos</a></b><br>A prophet from the southern kingdom of Judah, called by God to deliver a message of judgment to the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pleiades_and_orion.htm">Pleiades and Orion</a></b><br>Constellations mentioned in the verse, symbolizing God's creation and control over the universe.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and power over creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom to whom Amos is delivering God's message of impending judgment due to their injustice and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God bringing the universe into existence, demonstrating His omnipotence and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God&#8217;s creation of the universe, including the stars and constellations, demonstrates His supreme authority and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_control_over_nature.htm">God's Control Over Nature</a></b><br>Understand that God&#8217;s ability to turn darkness into dawn and day into night shows His control over time and seasons, reminding us of His constant presence and involvement in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_worship_the_creator.htm">The Call to Worship the Creator</a></b><br>Reflect on the importance of worshiping God as the Creator rather than the creation itself, avoiding idolatry and acknowledging His rightful place in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment_and_mercy.htm">God's Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>Consider how God&#8217;s power over creation is a reminder of His ability to judge nations, as well as His mercy in calling them to repentance through His prophets.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_awe_of_god's_power.htm">Living in Awe of God&#8217;s Power</a></b><br>Encourage a lifestyle that is in awe of God&#8217;s power and majesty, leading to a deeper trust and reliance on Him in all circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Amos_5_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Amos 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Amos_5_8_God_s_power_in_creation.htm">How does Amos 5:8 emphasize God's power over creation and nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/God_s_authority_in_creating_stars.htm">What does "He who made the Pleiades and Orion" reveal about God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Amos_5_8_boost_daily_faith.htm">How can recognizing God's control in Amos 5:8 strengthen our daily faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Amos_5_8_Genesis_1_1_Creator_God.htm">Connect Amos 5:8 with Genesis 1:1 on God's role as Creator.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Amos_5_8_on_prayer_life.htm">How should acknowledging God's sovereignty in Amos 5:8 influence our prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Amos_5_8_God_s_power_in_creation_2.htm">How does Amos 5:8 emphasize God's power over creation and nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_create_Pleiades_Orion.htm">What is the significance of God creating the Pleiades and Orion in Amos 5:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Amos_5_8_vs_human_control_of_nature.htm">How does Amos 5:8 challenge the belief in human control over nature?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_amos_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Amos 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/amos_5_8_vs._modern_star_dating.htm">Amos 5:8 &#8211; How can we reconcile the claim that God formed the Pleiades and Orion with modern astronomy, which dates these stars to vastly different periods?

This is profoundly impressive, since the prophets were surrounded by the pompous nature-worship of the East.<p>The Heb. word for the Pleiades (seven stars) means properly "heap" or "cluster," and that for Orion signifies "stout, strong one." The appearance of the Pleiades indicated the "sweet influences" of spring, that of Orion the winter solstice. Observe that Amos the herdsman, and Job the Arabian Emir, accustomed to the naked sky of the desert, make these special references to astronomical facts. The death-shadow suggests the darkest experiences of human life. Jehovah pours His light upon the deepest gloom of our lot. He, too, can make the day dark with night, covering the noonday sky with funereal pall, as at the Crucifixion. God is also made the perennial source of the rain, that "river of God which is full of water," and which is ever rising at His command from the great sea.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/amos/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Striking instances are given of God's creative power and omnipotence. <span class="cmt_word">Seek him that maketh the seven stars.</span> "Seek him" is not in the Hebrew. "He that maketh," etc., is in direct antithesis to "ye who turn," etc. (ver. 7). <span class="accented">The seven stars</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kimah</span>, "the heap," the constellation of the Pleiades (<a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; <a href="/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>). The Septuagint here has, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, but in Job has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>.

The identification of this term is discussed in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:891. The observation of this most remarkable cluster among the heavenly bodies would be natural to the pastoral life of Amos. <span class="cmt_word">And Orion;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">kesil</span>, "foolish," a rebel, the name being applied to Nimrod, whose representation was found by the Easterns in this constellation. Some render <span class="accented">kesil</span>, "gate;" others connect it with the Arabia <span class="accented">sohail</span>, equivalent to Sirius, or Canopus.

This and the following clause do not simply state that the regular interchange of day and night is in God's hands, but rather notify that God is a moral Governor of the world. He saves men from the utmost dangers, from the darkness of sin and from the night of ignorance; and, on the other hand, he sends calamity on those that offend his Law (comp. <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Maketh the day dark with night;</span> literally, as the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "darkeneth day into night." <span class="cmt_word">That calleth for the waters of the sea,</span> etc. As judgments are the prophet's theme, this expression cannot be an intimation of the working of the natural law by which the moisture taken up from the sea as cloud returns upon the earth as rain (comp. <a href="/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>). Rather it is an allusion to the Flood and similar catastrophes, which are proofs of God's judicial government of the universe, when "he maketh the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies" (Wisd. 5:17). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is his Name.</span> Jehovah, the self-existent God, doeth all these marvellous things, and men presume to scout his Law and think to be unpunished (<a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/amos/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#347;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Pleiades</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1460;&#1497;&#1502;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#238;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3598.htm">Strong's 3598: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cluster of stars, the Pleiades</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Orion,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
