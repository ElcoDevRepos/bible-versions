This reflects the importance of prayer in the life of a believer, emphasizing persistence and faithfulness in seeking God's will. Daniel's prayer is a model of humility and repentance, aligning with other biblical examples such as Nehemiah's prayer (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4-11</a>) and the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9-13</a>).<p><b>Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision</b><br>Gabriel is one of the few angels named in the Bible, known for delivering messages from God. His appearance to Daniel connects to the earlier vision in <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>, where he provided understanding of the vision of the ram and the goat. Gabriel's role as a messenger is consistent with his later appearance to Zechariah (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-27</a>), announcing significant events in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>came to me in swift flight</b><br>The phrase "swift flight" suggests the urgency and importance of the message Gabriel brings. It underscores the immediacy of God's response to Daniel's prayer, highlighting the divine nature of angelic beings who operate beyond human limitations. This swift action reflects God's attentiveness to the prayers of His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>, where God promises to answer before they call.<p><b>about the time of the evening sacrifice</b><br>The evening sacrifice, traditionally around 3 PM, was a significant time in Jewish worship, even though the temple was no longer standing during Daniel's time in Babylon. This reference indicates Daniel's continued devotion to God and adherence to the practices of his faith, despite being in exile. The timing also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who died at the ninth hour (<a href="/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34-37</a>), fulfilling the sacrificial system and establishing a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, known for his unwavering faith and integrity.

The Authorised Version follows the LXX. and Theodotion. The rendering has been defended on the ground that the word translated "swiftly" comes from a root meaning "to fly." and is literally rendered by <span class= "ital">flight.</span> Thus "caused to fly in flight" means "caused to fly swiftly." The marginal version "with weariness" finds supporters, and, if adopted, must be taken to refer to the bodily condition of Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17-27</a>).
