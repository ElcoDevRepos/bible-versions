The Septuagint renders the last clause of ver. 48 "chief and ruler (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of all the wise men of Babylon," reading <span class="accented">us gan</span> instead of <span class="accented">signeen.</span> Theodotion's is a fairly accurate rendering of the Massoretic text, as is also Jerome. The Peshitta renders this clause, "He made Daniel head over all the mighty men (<span class="accented">rabiheela</span>), and over all the wise men of Babylon." The translator must have inserted, or found before him inserted, the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">el</span>), "over," between <span class="accented">tab</span> and <span class="accented">signeen</span>, evidently a false reading, due to ignorance of the form Babylonianand Assyrian titles assumed. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>:, was originally maintained to be Persian. Hitzig connects it with an Arabic root, <span class="accented">sajan</span>, but the true derivation is now found to be <span class="accented">shokun</span> (Assyrian), "<span class="accented">governor."</span> It appears in Hebrew in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the deutero-Isaiah, as well as in Ezra and Nehemiah, showing the unlikelihood of any Persian derivation. Hitzig appears to regard Daniel as made the king's regent over the whole empire of Babylon; but this is not at all the meaning of the words. We must not be led away to believe that all this promotion befell Daniel at once; the statement here is summary, and includes many steps, and perhaps several years. Even at the utmost of his exaltation, he is not represented here as being made the regent of Nebuchadnezzar. as Hitzig would maintain. It is really only the province of Babylon, if we may not restrict the meaning of the word <span class="accented">medeena</span> even further, and regard it as equivalent to "city." We admit that this restriction of significance is not supported by the versions, but the fact that in so many cases we have traces of Syriac influences in Daniel, and that <span class="accented">medeena</span> means in Syriac "a city," renders this supposition not an impossible one. The precise limits of the province of Babylon in the days of Nebuchadnezzar cannot be settled. In later times it consisted mainly of the territory between the Tigris and the Euphrates, south of the <span class="accented">murus Medius</span>, with some territory between the latter river and the desert (Professor Rawlinson). It may be that the satrapy of Babylon was of considerably less extent. The word <span class="accented">hashleet</span> means "to cause to rule." This would be made true by making Daniel overseer in any department of the government of the province. It is not necessary to maintain that Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel satrap of Babylonia; at the same time, <span class="accented">shalet</span> is the title given to the satrap of Babylon. M. Lenormant thinks there must be an interpolation when Daniel is said to be set over all the governors of the wise men in Babylon. His arguments are founded mainly on the belief that the castes of astrologers, soothsayers, and magians - all that were included in the class of <span class="accented">hakmeen -</span> were hereditary, a thing which has not been proved. A difficulty has been urged by Lenormant that Daniel, as a zealous Jew, could not become head of a college of idolatrous priests. While there may be some force in this, one must beware of testing the actions of a Jew of the <span class="date">sixth century B.C.</span> by criteria and principles applicable to one of later times. At all events, this militates strongly against the idea that the Book of Daniel was written in the age of the Maccabees. When we see Daniel thus, a youth of probably two or three and twenty, promoted ultimately to be over the province of Babylon, and to be one of the king's most trusted councillors, Ezekiel's saying, which places him between Noah and Job (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>), becomes natural. Daniel had already been some years in the king's privy council before Ezekiel was carried into captivity. We do not know how long after the beginning of his prophetic work we are to date the prophecy of the fourteenth chapter - it may have been eight or nine years after. But even if it were only six years, Daniel would by this time have been for eleven years a member of the privy council of the Babylonian monarch, and possibly for a considerable portion of that period governor of the province of Babylon. At any rate, Daniel would bulk very large in the eyes of the poor Jewish captives. Though contemporary, he was so far removed from his fellow-countrymen in social position, that his goodness and greatness would be subject to similar exaggeration to that which happens to heroes of a long-past age. A better argument may be drawn from the fact that <span class="accented">sagan</span> is always a civil title. The insertion of the word <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> might easily be due to some scribe who thought that as Daniel was one of the wise men, head of them would be more likely than head of the civil governors of the province, and placed it as a suggestion of what ought to take the place of <span class="accented">signeen</span>; a copyist following, inserted it in the text. If we compare this chapter with the sixth, we find Daniel one of three who were to receive the accounts of the various governors. Daniel was thus, if we may apply to his office a title drawn from our own political usage, secretary of state for Babylonia. It is characteristic of Daniel, that having been made rich and great by the king, and having received many gifts at the hand of the king, does not satisfy him; he entreats favour for his friends also. Hitzig's objection that Daniel would have the appointment of his subordinates, would only be valid if Daniel had been made satrap If his <span class="accented">shaletship</span> extended merely to some one department of governmental work - and that seems to follow from the last clause of this verse - it is unlikely that he would have this power. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are set over the "business" ('<span class="accented">el</span>,<span class="accented">eedt</span>,') of the province of Babylon. This word, in Targumic Aramaic, is very generally used of constructions where labour is employed. We may regard their position as one something like being members of a labour bureau. Nebuchadezzar was a very great builder, so much so that almost all the bricks that have been got in Babylon are stamped with his name. While his Ninevite predecessors record in their inscriptions their campaigns, the kings they conquered, and the cities they sacked, the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar are almost entirely occupied with the various structures - temples, palaces, ramparts, and canals - which he had caused to be made. These buildings would need perpetual surveying. Further, as a great military genius, roads and canals would also be. important objects, in the carrying out of which captives would be employed. And the products of this enforced labour would have to be surveyed carefully. This seems more probable than that Daniel got these three friends appointed to do the work he himself was appointed to. The only plausible suggestion against this would be that Daniel desired that his friends be <span class="accented">set</span> jointly over the province of Babylon instead of himself, and, for his own part, he preferred to remain in the gate of the king. We know that those who wished to undermine a favourite in an Eastern court, frequently intrigued to get him promoted to a governorship, and then poisoned the mind of the king against him. On the other hand. the fact that Daniel had his province in Babylon, and would always be near the king when he was in his capital, rendered the implied precaution needless. <span class="accented">But Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</span> The gate of the king was the gate of his palace or the entrance to the central court from which all the apartments branched off. In the gate the kings of the East acted as judges over their people; in the gate the king held councils. Hence to sit in the gate of the king conveyed the twofold idea of being the king's representative on the throne of judgment, and of being the counsellor of the king - member of the privy council, to employ a modern term. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1448;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">promoted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7236.htm">Strong's 7236: </a> </span><span class="str2">To grow great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
