This phrase indicates a personal and internal struggle, reflecting the weight of the visions he received. The term "spirit" suggests an inner turmoil that goes beyond mere mental discomfort, indicating a profound spiritual disturbance. This aligns with other biblical figures who experienced similar distress when confronted with divine revelations, such as Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14-15</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p><b>and the visions in my mind alarmed me.</b><br>The visions Daniel received were not only spiritually unsettling but also mentally alarming. The term "visions" refers to the symbolic and prophetic imagery shown to Daniel, which included beasts and heavenly courts, representing future kingdoms and divine judgment. This alarm is understandable given the apocalyptic nature of the visions, which reveal the rise and fall of empires and the ultimate establishment of God's kingdom. The phrase "in my mind" suggests that these visions were vivid and clear, impacting Daniel's understanding and perception. This experience is similar to other prophetic visions in the Bible, such as those given to Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and John (Revelation 4-5), which also contain elements of divine majesty and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his unwavering faith and ability to interpret dreams and visions.

I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth, But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</span> The version of the Septuagint differs in some points from the Massoretic. In the fifteenth verse there is no reference to the spirit being in the body; it adds "of the night" after "visions," and changes "my head" into "my thoughts." The sixteenth verse presents no essential points of difference. In the seventeenth verse the differences are more considerable, "These great beasts are four kingdoms, which shall be destroyed from the earth." There seems a good deal to be said for the reading behind this version. The first variation, "kingdoms" instead of "kings," may be due to logic, but it has further "destroyed from" instead of "arising out of," which cannot have resulted from the Massoretic. The verb <span class="accented">qoom</span>, "to stand up," followed by <span class="accented">rain</span>, "from," is not elsewhere used in the sense which we find in the Massoretic here. When one is prone on the earth, as Saul before the revelation of the witch of Endor, "he stood up from the earth" (<a href="/1_samuel/28-23.htm">1 Samuel 28:23</a>, Targum Jonathan) - word for word as here. When Abraham (<a href="/genesis/23-3.htm">Genesis 23:3</a>, Targum Onkelos) arose from before his dead, we have a similar construction. In <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>, "David arose from his couch." This construction involves Change of position, either directly or implicitly. It is difficult to understand how the one reading arose from the other. The condensation of the sense as it appears in the Septuagint is not likely to be attained by a <span class="accented">falsarius.</span> In ver. 18 there is nothing calling for remark, save that the reduplication of "for ever and ever "is omitted. While Theodotion is nearer the Massoretic text, he too differs from it in some points - his rendering of <span class="accented">nidnay</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Schleusner thinks this probably a false reading for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. However, in <a href="/judges/14-9.htm">Judges 14:9</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> used for "body." In the seventeenth verse we have "kingdoms" instead of "kings." The last clause agrees with the Massoretic, but there is subjoined <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "which shall be taken away" - an addition that suggests that some of the manuscripts before Theodotion had the same reading as that before the Septuagint translator. He renders <span class="accented">yeqoomoon rain</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, showing that at all events he had a different preposition. The reduplication of "for ever and ever" is omitted. The Peshitta ver. 15 has "in the midst of my couch" instead of "in the midst of my body." In the sixteenth verse it resolves the bystanders into "servants." In the seventeenth verse the preposition is not <span class="accented">rain</span>, but '<span class="accented">al.</span> Jerome, instead of <span class="accented">corpus</span>, "body," has <span class="accented">in his</span>, "in these," - as if he had read <span class="accented">b'idena</span> instead of <span class="accented">nidnay</span>; he also in ver. 17 reads <span class="accented">regna</span>, not <span class="accented">reges.</span> The Mas-seretic text has some peculiarities. The first words afford one of the rare instances where we have the 'ithpael instead of the hithpael; it may be due to scribal correction. In the seventeenth verse '<span class="accented">inoon</span> (K'thib) affords an instance of the frequent Syriasm in Daniel. The "Most High" is rendered by a plural adjective, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">elyoneen</span>); it is explained differently. Kranichfeld and Stuart regard it as <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae.</span> Bevan and Behrmann regard it as a case of attraction, the latter giving as parallel instances, <span class="accented">hence</span> '<span class="accented">ayleem</span> (<a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>) and <span class="accented">benee nebeem.</span> The difficulty remains that neither the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> nor change of number is known in Aramaic. The fact that this strange form has produced no effect on any of the versions makes the reading suspicious. Professor Fuller sees in this word a proof of Babylonian influence, but he does not assign his reason, We now enter a new stage in the development of this vision. After the wonderful assize has ended, Daniel dreams that he is still standing among these innumerable multitudes, and, feeling that all these things are symbols, he is grieved because he cannot comprehend what is meant by them. So from one of those attendants who crowd the canvas of his vision he asks an explanation, or rather "the certainty," of this vision; he wishes to know whether it is s mere vision or of the nature of a revelation. This is a perfectly natural psychological condition in dreaming. In the act of dreaming we question ourselves whether we are dreaming or not; we may even ask one of the characters in our dream the question. The interpretation is interesting, but has been already, to some extent forestalled. A difficulty is seen by some commentators - how these four kingdoms could be said to arise, when one of them was nearing its fall. If we take the reading of the Septuagint, this difficulty is obviated. Saadia Gaon makes these four kings the nominative to the verb "receive" (wrongly translated in our Authorized Version, "take"), and maintains each of these empires shall hold the kingdom of Israel until the Messiah shall come. This view would necessitate grammatically that the Messiah should never come, but that the reign of these four world-empires should be prolonged into eternity. "The saints of the Most High," in the thought of Daniel would be, of necessity, the Jews; for we need not discuss the possibility of the angels being the holy ones implied here - they always have the kingdoms of the world under them - but we may see the Israel of faith in this figure. The believers in Christ are the true Israel, and the kingdom of heaven which Christ set up is thus promised to fill the earth. The Church is thus the true ultimate state. If we regard the Church as a society formed of those who are mutually attracted to each other. have a mutual love for each other, end have a common love to God, then all the history of the world is tending towards the establishment of such a society, universal as the world. National hatreds are much less acute now than they were. Despite the efforts to rouse class against class, there seems more sympathy between classes than there was. The final break-down of national and class oppositions, not necessarily by the abolition of either class or nation, will prepare the way for the Christ-commanded love which is the tie that unites the members of the true eternal Church of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_576.htm">Strong's 576: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1841.htm">Strong's 1841: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', an Israelite leader in Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was grieved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;&#183;k&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;ya&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3735.htm">Strong's 3735: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be distressed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1459.htm">Strong's 1459: </a> </span><span class="str2">Midst, middle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my spirit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7308.htm">Strong's 7308: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the visions</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1493;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;ez&#183;w&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2376.htm">Strong's 2376: </a> </span><span class="str2">Vision, appearance</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my mind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1461;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#234;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7217.htm">Strong's 7217: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head, the sum</span><br /><br /><span class="word">alarmed me.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1467;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;lun&#183;na&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_927.htm">Strong's 927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To terrify, hasten</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/7-15.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 7:15 As for me Daniel my spirit was (Dan.
