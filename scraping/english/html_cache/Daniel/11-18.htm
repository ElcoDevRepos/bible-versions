Historically, this refers to the actions of Antiochus III, also known as Antiochus the Great, who sought to expand his influence over the Mediterranean coastlands, including areas like Asia Minor and Greece. The "coastlands" often symbolize regions beyond Israel, indicating a broader geopolitical ambition. This expansionist policy aligns with the historical context of Hellenistic rulers seeking control over trade routes and strategic locations.<p><b>and capture many of them.</b><br>Antiochus III was initially successful in his campaigns, capturing several territories along the coast. This reflects the historical accounts of his conquests in the early 2nd century BC, where he managed to gain control over various regions, enhancing his power and influence. The phrase underscores the temporary success of earthly powers, which is a recurring theme in biblical prophecy, highlighting the transient nature of human achievements compared to God's eternal plan.<p><b>But a commander will put an end to his reproach</b><br>This part of the verse introduces a turning point, where a "commander" arises to challenge and ultimately halt Antiochus's advances. Historically, this refers to the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, who defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. The term "reproach" suggests the disgrace or dishonor brought upon Antiochus due to his defeat. This event marks the rise of Roman power and the decline of the Seleucid Empire, illustrating the shifting dynamics of world powers as prophesied in the Bible.<p><b>and will turn it back upon him.</b><br>The defeat of Antiochus by the Roman commander not only ended his campaign but also reversed his fortunes, leading to significant losses and the imposition of harsh terms by Rome. This reversal is emblematic of the biblical principle that pride and aggression often lead to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The turning back of reproach upon Antiochus serves as a reminder of divine justice and the ultimate sovereignty of God over the affairs of nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the Seleucid Empire, historically identified as Antiochus III, who sought to expand his territory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coastlands.htm">The Coastlands</a></b><br>These are regions along the Mediterranean Sea, which Antiochus III targeted in his military campaigns.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_commander.htm">A Commander</a></b><br>This is a reference to a Roman commander, likely Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus, who opposed Antiochus III and defeated him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/insolence.htm">Insolence</a></b><br>This term describes the arrogance and overconfidence of Antiochus III in his military ambitions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/turning_back_of_insolence.htm">Turning Back of Insolence</a></b><br>This event signifies the defeat and humiliation of Antiochus III by the Roman forces, illustrating the theme of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride can lead to one's downfall, as seen in the case of Antiochus III.

The verse teaches that human power is limited by God, pride invites reversal, and history unfolds exactly as Scripture declares.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Shall he turn.--</span>He goes northward, this being the direction indicated by "the isles." This has been explained of the victories gained by Antiochus the Great in Asia Minor. He is stated to have reduced various towns and islands, and finally to have taken Ephesus. He was in this way brought into contact with the Romans, and was defeated by L. Scipio, who is identified with "the prince" mentioned in this verse. The Greek versions exhibit considerable variations.<p><span class= "bld">A prince.</span>--It is doubtful whether this is to be taken as nominative or as accusative. The English Version treats it as nominative, St. Jerome and Theodotion as accusative. In accordance with the latter rendering, the meaning is, "The king of the north will cause to cease the princes who have been his reproach. But the princes shall return him his reproach." The word "prince" is used collectively to mean the rulers of the islands mentioned in the first part of the verse. It is stated that in the first instance the northern king will be successful, but in the end the princes will repay him the reproach which he inflicted upon them, as appears more fully in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this he shall turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is nearly unintelligible, "And he shall set (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) his face against the sea, and shall take many (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>), and shall turn the wrath of their reproach in an oath against his reproach." The translator had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Professor Bevan would ingeniously supply some words to the Greek. With all it seems nearly impossible to explain the relation between the Massoretic text and that used by the Septuagint. Theodotion is much briefer, "He shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many, and shall cause rulers to cease from their reproach; but his reproach shall return upon him." The Peshitta renders, "And he shall turn his face to the islands of the sea, and shall conquer many, and a ruler of reproach shall cause it to cease in regard to him, and his reproach shall return to him." The Vulgate is closely related to the Peshitta. We would render the last clause, with Behrmann, "Yea, his reproach will he repay to him." The events referred to are clear and obvious enough. Antiochus the Great took advantage of the disastrous defeat inflicted on Philip of Macedon by the Romans, to seize many of the islands of the archipelago. He not only took possession of all the Asiatic dominions of Philip, but crossed into Europe and seized Thrace. The Romans demanded that he should retire from all the former dominions of Philip. He refused, and war ensued, in which, after being driven out of Europe, he was totally defeated at Magnesia by Lucius Scipio, and compelled to surrender all his dominions west of the Taurus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he will turn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1447;&#1501;
