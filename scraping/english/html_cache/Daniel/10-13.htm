The term "prince" here suggests a hierarchy among spiritual beings, paralleling the structure of earthly kingdoms. The "kingdom of Persia" refers to the Persian Empire, a dominant world power during Daniel's time. The "twenty-one days" indicates a prolonged period of spiritual warfare, corresponding to the three weeks Daniel spent in mourning and prayer (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>). This suggests that Daniel's prayers were part of a larger spiritual battle. The concept of spiritual warfare is echoed in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of struggles against spiritual forces of evil.<p><b>Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me,</b><br>Michael is identified as "one of the chief princes," indicating his high rank among angelic beings. In <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>, Michael is called an archangel, reinforcing his significant role in spiritual battles. Michael's intervention suggests that he has a special responsibility for protecting God's people, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, where he stands up for the children of Israel. His assistance highlights the reality of angelic support in spiritual conflicts and the importance of divine intervention in overcoming evil forces.<p><b>for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.</b><br>The phrase "left there with the kings of Persia" implies that the speaker, likely the angelic messenger, was engaged in a struggle with multiple spiritual entities associated with Persia. The "kings" may refer to other spiritual powers aligned with the prince of Persia, indicating a coalition of forces opposing God's purposes. This reflects the broader theme of spiritual opposition to God's plans throughout history. The mention of being "left there" suggests a temporary stalemate until Michael's arrival, emphasizing the need for divine assistance in spiritual warfare. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the ultimate triumph of His will, as seen in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7-9</a>, where Michael and his angels defeat the dragon and his forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision and message from an angelic being.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince_of_the_kingdom_of_persia.htm">The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia</a></b><br>A spiritual being, likely a demonic force, opposing God's messenger.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/michael.htm">Michael</a></b><br>An archangel, described as one of the chief princes, who comes to assist in the spiritual battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings_of_persia.htm">The Kings of Persia</a></b><br>Likely referring to spiritual entities or influences over the earthly kingdom of Persia.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Daniel is receiving a revelation concerning future events and spiritual realities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_spiritual_warfare.htm">Understanding Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize that there is a spiritual realm where battles are fought, influencing earthly events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels.htm">The Role of Angels</a></b><br>Angels, like Michael, are active participants in God's plan, assisting and protecting believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_prayer.htm">Perseverance in Prayer</a></b><br>Daniel's experience shows the importance of persistent prayer, even when answers are delayed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite opposition, God's purposes will ultimately prevail, as seen in the assistance provided by Michael.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/awareness_of_spiritual_opposition.htm">Awareness of Spiritual Opposition</a></b><br>Be aware of the spiritual forces that may oppose God's work in our lives and the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_10_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 10:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_10_13_s_lesson_on_spiritual_warfare.htm">How does Daniel 10:13 illustrate spiritual warfare in our daily lives?

If we were without a revelation, we should have thought it congruent that God Himself should direct all events in the world without using any intervening means. But revelation points out that as spiritual beings carry out God's purpose in the natural world (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand.

Like the LXX., Thee-dotion declares that Michael was left with the Prince of Persia. The Peshitta agrees more with the Massoretic, but, like the LXX. and Theedotion, it is with the "Prince" of Persia that there is some one remaining. The Peshitta here, in opposition to the Greek versions, has the statement that Gabriel remained, not Michael. The Vulgate agrees still further with the Massoretic, only instead of the plural "kings," it has "king." The most important differences are in the last clause, where the LXX. and Theodotion must have had the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> where the Massoretic has the niphal. Gratz adopts this reading, which certainly has the advantage of making sense of an otherwise unintelligible passage. Professor Bevan, in his easy way, suggests this to be probably a mere guess, the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, and the substitution of a transitive for an intransitive verb are quite in the manner of the LXX. translators. He forgets that Theodotion also has this variation, and also that, without any justification from the versions, he himself has suggested various readings. He does not observe that this interpretation affords a reason for Gabriel's presence with Daniel. Michael relieved him in his opposition to the Prince of Persia. The other variant, "prince" instead of "king," has the support of all the versions. <span class="accented">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.</span> That is to say, during the whole of Daniel's fast. The angelology of later Judaism is a very complicated, not to say confused, subject. The angelology of one age is not that of another; and the angelology of the Jews in one country is not that of the Jews in another. The Jews themselves understood that the Babylonian captivity did a great deal to develop the doctrine of the angels; the Jewish tradition was that they brought back from Babylon the names of the angels. Not only had their residence in Babylon defined the Jewish ideas as to the names f the angels, they began to have clearer ideas of their functions. They reached the idea that every race had its guardian angel. This view is expressed in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, according to the Septuagint, "He set bounds for the nations according to the number of the angels of God." To a similar purport is Ecclus. 17:17, "To each of the nations he appointed a leader, and Israel is the portion of the Lord." There seems, however, a preparation for this in <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a> (comp. also <a href="/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>). As independent of revelation there is a strong inherent probability that there are races of beings of intelligence and might vastly superior to man, there is nothing inherently improbable in these intelligences being employed by the Almighty in furthering his providential scheme. Men are instruments of God; is it not at least not improbable that, if there are angels, they, too, co-operate with God in the working out of his great purpose? That every nation should have an angelic prince over it is not more extraordinary than that every Church should have a special angel over it (<a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, etc.). That there should be conflicts between these angelic princes is simply to say they are finite. Hitzig's reference to <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> is not to the point, for there is no indication of warlike opposition here. By the indications here, we might judge that the opposition of the Prince of Persia was to the coming of Gabriel to reveal to Daniel the purpose of God. We know nothing of the means employed in the opposition, or of the reason of it. Keil and Kliefoth have the idea that Gabriel was striving to influence the King of Persia, but was hindered in his efforts by the "Prince of Persia;" this is scarcely berne out by the context. <span class="accented">But</span>, <span class="accented">lo</span>, <span class="accented">Michael</span>, <span class="accented">one of the chief princes</span>, <span class="accented">came to help</span> me. Michael ("Who is like God?") is, in the twenty-first verse, declared to be the "prince" of the Jewish people, therefore equivalent to "the captain of the host of the Lord" (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). He is referred to in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>. Where he is called one of "the chief princes," there is reference to an angelic hierarchy, whether the same as that we find developed in the Book of Enoch or not cannot be decided certainly. In the Book of Tobit 12:15 Raphael declares himself "one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints, and who go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." The Book of Tobit seems to have been written about <span class="date">B.C. 400</span>; hence this is an indication of opinion before the Books of Enoch. In the Enoch books not only are the great angels mentioned, but their names arc given, and functions are assigned to them; but they are numbered as four, not seven. Enoch is posterior to Tobit, and finds a place for Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel. We have no means of testing whether the number of the chief angelic princes, of whom Michael was one, was four or seven, according to the opinion of Daniel. From the fact that Enoch is, so to speak, in the direct line of apocalyptic descent from Daniel, and Tobit is not, and, moreover, as the angelology of Tobit is in close connection with the Persian hierarchy of <span class="accented">am-haspentas</span>, of which there were seven, - we may regard four as the more genuinely Jewish number. The later Jewish angel-elegy has many Persian elements, as shown by Dr. Kohut, in his 'Angelologie und Demonologie.' Whether the number of the archangels be made four or seven, both Gabriel and Michael are of the number, whereas Gabriel's words would rather indicate that, though Michael belonged to the rank of chief prince, he did not. As we cannot tell the nature of the opposition, we cannot tell the nature of the help afforded. <span class="accented">And I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> It is very difficult to interpret this if we retain the Massoretic reading. In the first place, the sense given to <span class="accented">nothartee</span> in the Authorized and Revised is unsuitable. The angel is explaining how, after having delayed three whole weeks, he has now come. The sentence, as interpreted above,would have explained why he could not come at all to Daniel. It is attempted to get over this by explaining that Gabriel had beaten off the "Prince" of Persia, and that Michael remained with the King of Persia instead of him. This view, however, contradicts the function assigned to angels of nations, and implies a quasi-omnipresence on the part of Gabriel, and would render his explanation no explanation. The explanation of Gesenius, Havernick, and yon Lengerke, that <span class="accented">nothartee</span> is to be taken as meaning "I received the pre-eminence," as Wirier, "superior discessi apud reges Persarum," has no justification in usage. Gescnius would bring in the Syriac use of the hithpael of this verb, but though both Castell and Brockehuann assign meanings suitable, none of their quotations represents a sense precisely similar to that assigned to the verb here Hitzig's interpretation, "I was delayed," fails to explain his coming. Ewald's explanation, "I was superfluous," is logical, but has no grammatical justification. Professor Bevan's explanation, which would take this last clause as parenthetical, is untenable, as it supplies no redden for the presence of Gabriel with Daniel. We must follow the LXX. and Theodotion in reading, either as Meinhold and Behrmann, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> or better, as Gratz, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, as the <span class="accented">vav </span>in the former ease would naturally be read conversively. Besides, Gratz's reading explains the needlessly emphatic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Further, it seems needful to accept the reading of the two Greek versions and the Peshitta, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>. None of the old versions support the Massoretic; the Vulgate is the nearest; and all of them have either read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> or regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span> as a form of the construct state, and so vocalized differently. Further, the later context here implies the contiuance of the conflict or controversy (vers. 20, 21). We must understand, then, that Gabriel left Michael to maintain the conflict against the angelic "Prince" of Persia, while he came in obedience to Daniel's prayer. We can have but little idea of what is meant by this conflict in the heavenlies between angelic beings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However, the prince</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;
