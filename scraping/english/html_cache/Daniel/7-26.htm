The "court" suggests a formal assembly of divine beings, possibly angels, presided over by God Himself. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that depict God as the ultimate judge (e.g., <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-12</a>). The convening of the court signifies the beginning of a decisive action against evil powers, reflecting the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>and his dominion will be taken away</b><br>The "his" in this phrase refers to the fourth beast described earlier in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, often interpreted as a representation of a powerful, oppressive kingdom or ruler. Historically, this has been associated with the Roman Empire or a future antichrist figure. The removal of dominion indicates a transfer of power, emphasizing that earthly kingdoms are temporary and subject to God's ultimate authority. This aligns with the biblical narrative that God raises and deposes kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><b>and completely destroyed forever</b><br>This phrase underscores the finality and totality of God's judgment. The destruction is not partial or temporary but absolute and eternal. This reflects the eschatological hope found throughout Scripture, where evil is ultimately vanquished (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20, 20</a>:10). The complete destruction of this dominion is a precursor to the establishment of God's everlasting kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and reaffirmed in the New Testament with the coming of Christ's eternal reign (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_court.htm">The Court</a></b><br>This refers to the divine court or heavenly tribunal that God convenes to execute judgment.

Back in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> the &#8220;little horn&#8221; is boasting and persecuting, but now everything changes. Just as in <a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4</a>, &#8220;He who sits in the heavens laughs,&#8221; so here God interrupts the evil agenda.<p>- Scripture often uses &#8220;but&#8221; to introduce God&#8217;s sovereign intervention (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>). The emphasis is that no matter how dominant evil appears, God retains the last word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the court will convene</b><p>- Daniel has already seen this heavenly courtroom in verses 9&#8211;10: &#8220;thrones were set in place&#8230; the court was convened, and the books were opened&#8221;. The same scene reappears here, underscoring its certainty.<p>- Key truths about this court:<p>&#8226; It is divine&#8212;presided over by the &#8220;Ancient of Days,&#8221; not earthly judges (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It is public&#8212;&#8220;books&#8221; are opened, revealing perfect records (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; It is final&#8212;no appeals, mistrials, or hung juries.<p>- Believers can take heart, knowing that ultimate justice is not delayed forever (<a href="/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and</b><p>- The conjunction ties the convening of the court directly to its action. Judgment is not a formality; it produces results.<p>- When God rises to judge, the outcome is automatic (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his dominion will be taken away</b><p>- &#8220;His&#8221; refers to the little horn, later identified as the final antichrist (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4, 8</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-7</a>).<p>- Notice the passive verb&#8212;God removes the authority; the tyrant cannot retain it.<p>- Similar language appears in <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>: &#8220;Yet he will be broken apart, but not by human hands&#8221;, highlighting divine action.<p>- Points to ponder:<p>&#8226; Satan can only exercise borrowed authority (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; When God ends that lease, the power evaporates instantly (<a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and</b><p>- Another link, stressing that removal of dominion leads straight to obliteration. There is no rebound, no regrouping.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>completely destroyed forever</b><p>- The phrase piles up certainty: &#8220;completely&#8230; forever.&#8221; This mirrors <a href="/daniel/7-11.htm">Daniel 7:11</a>, where the beast is &#8220;slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> echoes the same finale: &#8220;The beast was captured&#8230; thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur&#8221;.<p>- Eternal judgment is irreversible (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>). Evil is not merely curbed but annihilated with no possibility of resurgence.<p>- For the saints, this guarantees everlasting safety (<a href="/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-26.htm">Daniel 7:26</a> is God&#8217;s promise that, despite fierce opposition, a heavenly court session will strip the antichrist of every ounce of power and consign him to irrevocable ruin.
