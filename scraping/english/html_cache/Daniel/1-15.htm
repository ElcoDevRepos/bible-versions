In the context of the Babylonian exile, Daniel and his friends were under pressure to conform to the Babylonian culture, which included eating food that was not kosher. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or a period of testing in the Bible, as seen in the Ten Commandments or the ten plagues of Egypt.<p><b>they looked healthier and better nourished</b><br>This phrase highlights the miraculous provision and favor of God. Despite consuming only vegetables and water, Daniel and his friends appeared healthier than those who ate the rich food from the king's table. This outcome underscores the biblical principle that obedience to God brings blessing and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience leads to blessings.<p><b>than all the young men</b><br>The comparison to "all the young men" emphasizes the distinctiveness of Daniel and his friends. It suggests that their commitment to God's laws set them apart from their peers. This distinction is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's people are called to be holy and set apart, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>.<p><b>who were eating the king&#8217;s food</b><br>The king's food likely included items forbidden by Jewish dietary laws, such as pork or food sacrificed to idols. Eating such food would have defiled Daniel and his friends according to Levitical law (Leviticus 11). This situation reflects the broader theme of remaining faithful to God amidst a pagan culture, a challenge faced by many biblical figures, including Joseph in Egypt and Esther in Persia.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his faithfulness to God and his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah and took many Israelites, including Daniel, into exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who ordered the training of select young men from Israel for service in his court.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashpenaz.htm">Ashpenaz</a></b><br>The chief official appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to oversee the training of the young men.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten-day_test.htm">The Ten-Day Test</a></b><br>A period during which Daniel and his friends ate only vegetables and drank water, instead of the king's rich food and wine, to prove their dietary choice would not harm their health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_small_things.htm">Faithfulness in Small Things</a></b><br>Daniel's commitment to God's dietary laws, even in a foreign land, shows the importance of faithfulness in seemingly small matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The outcome of the ten-day test demonstrates that God honors those who trust Him and provides for their needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_to_stand_apart.htm">Courage to Stand Apart</a></b><br>Daniel and his friends were willing to stand apart from their peers to remain faithful to God, encouraging believers to have the courage to uphold their convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_obedience.htm">The Impact of Obedience</a></b><br>Daniel's obedience led to a visible difference in his appearance, illustrating how obedience to God can lead to tangible blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_health.htm">Holistic Health</a></b><br>The passage highlights the connection between spiritual obedience and physical well-being, encouraging believers to consider how their lifestyle choices honor God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_1_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 1:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_1_15_Obedience_s_benefits.htm">How does Daniel 1:15 demonstrate the benefits of obedience to God's commands?

Ten days is long enough for visible change yet short enough that only the Lord could account for a dramatic result. The phrase marks the moment when the steward must decide whether obedience to God or allegiance to Babylon&#8217;s menu will prevail. Similar time-bound tests appear in <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>, where the church in Smyrna faces &#8220;tribulation for ten days,&#8221; underscoring God&#8217;s sovereign control over the length and outcome of every trial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they looked healthier</b><p>The Hebrew youths&#8217; appearance sends a visual sermon: God rewards faithfulness with evident blessing. <a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a> says, &#8220;Those who look to Him are radiant.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7-8</a> promises that fearing the Lord &#8220;will bring healing to your body.&#8221; Daniel and his friends did more than skip rich food; they trusted God, and that trust literally showed on their faces. Their health points to the Creator who designed the body and honors obedience with wholeness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and better nourished</b><p>Nutrition normally comes from calories, yet God proves that &#8220;man shall not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, citing <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>). The text emphasizes superior nourishment, not mere survival. What Babylon considered a deprivation&#8212;vegetables and water&#8212;became a channel for divine enrichment. <a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a> reminds us, &#8220;The blessing of the LORD enriches.&#8221; Physical vitality here illustrates a broader truth: dependence on God feeds body and soul more completely than the richest earthly fare.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>than all the young men</b><p>The comparison is corporate and public.

By declining it (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), the four young men rejected compromise without rebellion. <a href="/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a> voices the same desire: &#8220;Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing.&#8221; First Corinthians 10:21 warns, &#8220;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.&#8221; The king&#8217;s food represents a world system offering pleasure at the price of conscience; Daniel shows that loyalty to God brings greater reward than any royal delicacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a> demonstrates that when God&#8217;s people trust His directives, He visibly blesses them&#8212;even in hostile settings. A simple ten-day test exposed the emptiness of Babylon&#8217;s allure and showcased the sufficiency of God. Faithfulness produced evident health, superior nourishment, and unmistakable distinction, proving that obedience to the Lord is always the wisest, healthiest, and most rewarding choice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Appeared fairer.--</span>Thus was God beginning to assert His power among the Babylonians. This change in the appearance of Daniel was the effect of his free grace, not of the meat that came from the king's palace. May it not have been that the young exiles thought of the words of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/52-11.htm" title="Depart you, depart you, go you out from there, touch no unclean thing; go you out of the middle of her; be you clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.">Isaiah 52:11</a>), "Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out thence, touch no unclean thing"?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- At the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat</span>. The Septuagint is a little paraphrastic, and renders, "After ten days their countenance appeared beautiful and their habit of body better than that of the other young men who ate of the king's meat." Theodotion is painfully faithful to the Massoretic text. The Peshitta translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">tob</span>), "good," "fair," by <span class="accented">sha-peera</span>, "beautiful." We have here the result of the experiment. At the end of the ten days these youths who had lived plainly are fairer and fatter than those who partook of the royal dainties - a result that implies nothing miraculous; it was simply the natural result of living on food suited to the climate. The grammar of the passage is peculiar; <span class="accented">mareehem</span>, which so far as form goes might be plural, is construed with a singular verb and adjective, but <span class="accented">bere'eem</span>, "fatter," is plural. The explanation is that while "countenance," the substantive, is in the singular, it is not the substantive to the adjective "fat," but "they" understood. The sentence is not intended to assert that their faces merely were fatter than those of the other youths of their rank and circum<span class="accented">stances</span>, but that their whole body was so. This contrast of reference is brought out in the Septuagint paraphrase. Any one looking on the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, and comparing them with the sculptures and paintings of Egypt, will observe the relatively greater stoutness of the Assyrians. In the eunuchs especially, one cannot fail to <span class="accented">notice</span> the full <span class="accented">round</span> faces and the double chins of those in immediate attendance on the king. Among savage nations and semi-civilized ones, corpulence is regarded as a sign of nobility. The frequent long fasts, due to failure of their scanty crops or the difficulty of catching game, would keep the ordinary savage spare; only one who could employ the sinews and <span class="accented">possessions</span> of others would be sure of being always well fed, consequently the corpulent man was incontestably the wealthy nobleman. In semi-civilized countries, as Babylon, this was probably a survival. On the sculptures the kings are not unwieldy with corpulence, but the eunuchs have an evident tendency to this. A king, abstemious himself, might feel his consequence increased by having as his attendants those who bore about in their persons the evidence of how well those were nourished who fed at his table. There is no reason to imagine that Nebuchadnezzar was superior to his contemporaries in regard to this. The <span class="accented">melzar</span>, having thus seen the result of the experiment, must see that, so far as externals were concerned, the Hebrews who fed on pulse were better than their companions. The period of ten days was a short one, but not too short for effects such as those mentioned to be manifested. Jephet-ibn-Ali thinks that special leanness was inflicted on those who were unfaithful or had failed in courage. That, however, is an unnecessary supposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;miq&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124;
