King Belshazzar was the last king of Babylon, and his reign marked the end of the Babylonian Empire. The third year of his reign would be around 551 BC. This period was characterized by political instability and the impending rise of the Medo-Persian Empire. The historical context is crucial as it sets the stage for the prophetic visions concerning the future empires that would follow Babylon.<p><b>a vision appeared to me, Daniel</b><br>Daniel, a Jewish exile in Babylon, is the recipient of divine visions. This emphasizes his role as a prophet and a trusted servant of God. The vision is a supernatural revelation, a common method through which God communicated His plans and purposes to His prophets. Daniel's experiences with visions and dreams are consistent with other biblical figures who received divine messages, such as Joseph and Ezekiel.<p><b>subsequent to the one that had appeared to me earlier</b><br>This indicates that Daniel had received previous visions, specifically referring to the vision in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. The continuity of visions suggests a progressive revelation of God's plan for the future. The earlier vision in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> introduced the concept of successive world empires, and this subsequent vision in <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a> provides further details, particularly focusing on the Medo-Persian and Greek empires.
