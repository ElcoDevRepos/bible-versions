In the context of <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, King Nebuchadnezzar is the subject of this prophecy. The idea of being "driven away" suggests a forceful removal from society, reflecting the consequences of pride and disobedience to God. This mirrors the biblical theme of separation from God due to sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a> when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden.<p><b>and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field</b><br>The imagery of living with beasts signifies a loss of human dignity and status. In ancient Near Eastern culture, being reduced to the level of animals was a profound humiliation. This condition reflects the biblical principle that pride leads to downfall, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>. It also foreshadows the restoration theme, where humility precedes exaltation, akin to the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>.<p><b>You will feed on grass like an ox</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete transformation of Nebuchadnezzar's state, from a powerful king to a creature with basic, animalistic needs. The act of eating grass symbolizes a return to a primitive state, highlighting the consequences of pride. This can be compared to the humbling of other biblical figures, such as Saul's transformation in <a href="/acts/9.htm">Acts 9:1-19</a>.<p><b>and be drenched with the dew of heaven</b><br>Being "drenched with the dew of heaven" suggests exposure to the elements, indicating vulnerability and a lack of shelter. Dew in the Bible often symbolizes divine blessing or presence (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>), but here it underscores Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal, as dew refreshes the earth, so too can divine intervention restore a soul.<p><b>and seven times shall pass you by</b><br>The "seven times" likely refers to a complete period of divine judgment, as the number seven often signifies completeness or perfection in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This period is a divinely appointed time for Nebuchadnezzar's transformation and repentance. It parallels the concept of a sabbatical year or Jubilee, where restoration and renewal occur (Leviticus 25).<p><b>until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind</b><br>This phrase underscores the central theme of divine sovereignty. The acknowledgment of God's ultimate authority is a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5-7</a>. Nebuchadnezzar's experience serves as a reminder that earthly power is subordinate to God's will, echoing the message of <a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10-12</a>, where kings are advised to serve the Lord with reverence.<p><b>and gives it to whom He wishes</b><br>This final phrase highlights God's sovereign choice in appointing rulers, a theme evident throughout Scripture. It reflects the biblical understanding that leadership is a divine appointment, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>. This principle is exemplified in the rise and fall of leaders like Saul and David, demonstrating that God raises and removes kings according to His purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experiences a humbling period of madness as a result of his pride and failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and advisor to King Nebuchadnezzar, who interprets the king's dream and delivers God's message of impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar rules, representing human pride and power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beasts_of_the_field.htm">The Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolic of Nebuchadnezzar's fall from human dignity to a state of animal-like existence, emphasizing the humbling of human pride.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His supreme authority over all earthly kingdoms and rulers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's account warns against the dangers of pride and self-exaltation.

This exile is God-ordained discipline, echoing how Cain was sent away in <a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a> and how lepers were put outside the camp in <a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>. The separation underscores the seriousness of pride, reminding us that &#8220;God opposes the proud&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field</b><p>The king will live among animals, losing royal comforts and human fellowship. This humbling mirrors <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8230; is like the beasts that perish.&#8221; It also anticipates the prodigal son&#8217;s degradation among swine in <a href="/luke/15-16.htm">Luke 15:16</a>. God is showing that without Him, even the greatest ruler can be reduced to an animal-like existence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will feed on grass like an ox</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s diet becomes that of livestock, portraying total humiliation. Similar imagery appears when the rich man in <a href="/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a> watches &#8220;lambs graze&#8221; on his ruined estate. The literal eating of grass highlights that human greatness is nothing without submission to the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-28.htm">1 Corinthians 1:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drenched with the dew of heaven</b><p>Unprotected, the king will spend nights outdoors, soaked by dew (cf. <a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>). God removes every shelter to show that He alone is refuge (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>). The phrase also hints at divine oversight; even the dew testifies to God&#8217;s continual presence (<a href="/job/38-28.htm">Job 38:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seven times shall pass you by</b><p>&#8220;Seven times&#8221; signals a complete, literal period&#8212;likely seven years&#8212;during which God&#8217;s purpose will be fully worked out.

Thus these words mean "thou shalt be driven." (Comp. <a href="/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will</span>. The Septuagint Version is here much briefer, and in that better, "And they shall put thee in guard, and send thee into a desert place." The Massoretic text, although it agrees with that from which Theodotion's Version, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate have been translated, is pleonastic. The Vulgate drops the causative element, and simply says, "Thou shalt eat grass like the ox, and thou shalt be wet with the dew of heaven." The Peshitta, while translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> by the aphel of '<span class="accented">acal</span> - that is to say, making the meaning causative - renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> by the passive, <span class="accented">titztaba</span>; similarly Theodotion renders it. If we are to take the words of Daniel strictly, even in the Massoretic, much more if we take the Septuagint, text, he seems to have understood the dream to point, not to lycanthropy, but to an overthrow at the hands of his enemies, when they would compel him to eat grass in his distress, and, by depriving him of every shelter, force him to be wet with the dew of heaven. There is nothing to indicate that the compulsion should work within, and that by these inner scourges the messengers of the Most High would drive Nebuchadnezzar forth to the fields. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will be driven away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2957.htm">Strong's 2957: </a> </span><span class="str2">To chase away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mankind,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1441;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_606.htm">Strong's 606: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and your dwelling</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1436;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;r&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
