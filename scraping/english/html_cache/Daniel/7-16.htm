This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek divine insight (e.g., Joseph in <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>). The "one of those who were standing there" likely refers to an angelic being, as angels often serve as messengers and interpreters of visions in Scripture (e.g., Gabriel in <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>). This setting emphasizes the heavenly court, a common motif in apocalyptic literature, where divine decrees are issued and explained.<p><b>and I asked him the true meaning of all this</b><br>Daniel's inquiry highlights the importance of seeking wisdom and understanding, a theme prevalent in the wisdom literature of the Bible (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>). The phrase "true meaning" suggests that the vision has a deeper, spiritual significance beyond its surface imagery. This reflects the biblical principle that God's revelations often require interpretation (e.g., Jesus explaining parables in <a href="/matthew/13-36.htm">Matthew 13:36-43</a>).<p><b>So he told me the interpretation of these things</b><br>The response to Daniel's question underscores the role of divine revelation in understanding God's plans. The interpretation provided by the angel is authoritative, as it comes from a heavenly source. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God provides clarity through His messengers (e.g., the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in <a href="/daniel/2-36.htm">Daniel 2:36-45</a>). The phrase "these things" refers to the symbolic elements of the vision, which are often prophetic, pointing to future events and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Daniel receives a vision of four great beasts, each representing a kingdom, which is a symbolic representation of future events and empires.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_interpreter.htm">The Interpreter</a></b><br>An angelic being or heavenly figure who provides Daniel with the interpretation of the vision, signifying divine revelation and understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting.htm">The Setting</a></b><br>The vision occurs during the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, a time of political turmoil and transition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdoms.htm">The Kingdoms</a></b><br>The four beasts represent four successive kingdoms, culminating in the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_understanding.htm">Seeking Understanding</a></b><br>Daniel's approach to seek understanding from the heavenly figure teaches us the importance of seeking divine wisdom and clarity in our spiritual journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The vision and its interpretation emphasize God's control over history and the rise and fall of empires, reassuring believers of His ultimate authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_uncertainty.htm">Faithfulness in Uncertainty</a></b><br>Daniel's example encourages us to remain faithful and trust in God's plan, even when faced with uncertain and challenging times.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels.htm">The Role of Angels</a></b><br>The presence of the interpreter highlights the role of angels as messengers and servants of God, providing guidance and insight to believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>The vision points to the establishment of God's eternal kingdom, reminding us to live with an eternal perspective and hope in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_7_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 7:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_7_16_s_impact_on_prophecy.htm">How does Daniel 7:16 enhance our understanding of prophetic visions in the Bible?
