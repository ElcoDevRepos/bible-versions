This time of humbling was prophesied in <a href="/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a> as a divine judgment for his pride. The "days" signify a complete period of divine discipline, emphasizing God's sovereignty over time and human affairs.<p><b>I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's act of looking up symbolizes a recognition of divine authority and a turning away from self-reliance. In biblical terms, looking to heaven often signifies seeking God&#8217;s help or acknowledging His supremacy (<a href="/psalms/123.htm">Psalm 123:1</a>). This act marks the beginning of his restoration and repentance.<p><b>and my sanity was restored to me</b><br>The restoration of Nebuchadnezzar's sanity signifies God's mercy and the fulfillment of His promise. It highlights the theme of restoration after repentance, a common biblical motif (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>). This restoration also serves as a testament to God's power to heal and renew.<p><b>Then I praised the Most High</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's praise of the "Most High" reflects a significant theological shift. The title "Most High" is used throughout the Old Testament to denote God's supreme authority over all earthly and heavenly powers (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>). This acknowledgment marks a departure from his previous idolatry and self-exaltation.<p><b>and I honored and glorified Him who lives forever</b><br>This phrase underscores the eternal nature of God, contrasting with the temporal nature of human kingdoms. The act of honoring and glorifying God is a recognition of His eternal existence and unchanging nature (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>). It reflects a heart transformed by divine encounter.<p><b>For His dominion is an everlasting dominion</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges God's unending rule, a central theme in the book of Daniel. This statement contrasts with the transient nature of earthly kingdoms, including his own. It echoes the prophecy in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> about God's kingdom that will never be destroyed.<p><b>and His kingdom endures from generation to generation</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the perpetual and unchanging nature of God's kingdom. It connects to the biblical theme of God's faithfulness across generations (<a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>). This enduring kingdom is a type of the eternal reign of Christ, who is prophesied to establish a kingdom that will last forever (<a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experienced a humbling period of insanity as a result of his pride and failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar ruled, known for its grandeur and power during his reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The realm where God resides, symbolizing divine authority and the source of Nebuchadnezzar's restored sanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_of_sanity.htm">Restoration of Sanity</a></b><br>The event marking the end of Nebuchadnezzar's humbling period, leading to his acknowledgment of God's eternal dominion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledging God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that all power and authority ultimately belong to God, and our lives should reflect this understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Learn from Nebuchadnezzar's experience that pride leads to downfall, while humility brings restoration and blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>Understand that turning our eyes toward heaven and acknowledging God can lead to spiritual and personal restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Embrace the truth that God's kingdom is everlasting, and our lives should be aligned with His eternal purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/praise_and_worship.htm">Praise and Worship</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of worship, regularly blessing and glorifying God for His unchanging nature and dominion.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_4_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 4:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_34_God_s_eternal_rule.htm">How does Daniel 4:34 demonstrate God's eternal dominion and kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_humility_from_Nebuchadnezzar_4.htm">What can we learn about humility from Nebuchadnezzar's experience in Daniel 4:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_34_and_Romans_13_1_link.htm">How does Daniel 4:34 connect with God's sovereignty in Romans 13:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_rule_on_decisions.htm">How can acknowledging God's rule in Daniel 4:34 impact daily decision-making?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_honor_God_like_Nebuchadnezzar.htm">In what ways can we "praise and exalt" God as Nebuchadnezzar did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_34_God_s_rule_over_rulers.htm">How does Daniel 4:34 demonstrate God's sovereignty over human kingdoms and rulers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_4_34_God_s_eternal_dominion_nature.htm">What does Daniel 4:34 reveal about the nature of God's eternal dominion?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Nebuchadnezzar_s_change_rethink_repentance.htm">How does Nebuchadnezzar's transformation in Daniel 4:34 challenge our understanding of repentance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_daniel_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Daniel 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_did_nebuchadnezzar's_kingdom_endure.htm">In Daniel 4:34&#8211;37, how could Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s kingdom remain intact for so long during his extended absence if he truly lost his reason? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/did_foreign_kings_ever_honor_israel's_god.htm">Psalm 138:4&#8211;5 speaks of all kings praising God.

Our lives, like the king&#8217;s, are held to God&#8217;s schedule, not ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I, Nebuchadnezzar</b><p>The narrative shifts to first-person testimony. The most powerful ruler on earth steps forward as a witness to God&#8217;s supremacy, echoing other personal accounts of conversion (compare <a href="/acts/26-12.htm">Acts 26:12-18</a>).

Like the prodigal &#8220;coming to his senses&#8221; and resolving to return to his father (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-18</a>), Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s gaze signals repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my sanity was restored to me</b><p>Restoration is immediate and complete. Only the Creator can mend a mind, just as He healed bodies and spirits throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/30-2.htm">Psalm 30:2</a>; <a href="/mark/5-15.htm">Mark 5:15</a>). The king&#8217;s experience illustrates <a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>&#8212;God grants &#8220;a spirit of power, love, and self-discipline,&#8221; reversing the chaos of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then I praised the Most High</b><p>The first use of renewed faculties is worship.

By his "understanding" is not meant his consciousness so much as his sense of personality, which had been lost for a time.<p><span class= "bld">Whose dominion</span> . . .--These words, like those in <a href="/daniel/4-3.htm" title="How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.">Daniel 4:3</a>, recall <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm" title="Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures throughout all generations.">Psalm 145:13</a>; and the next verse is not unlike <a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm" title="All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.">Isaiah 40:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-13.htm" title="Yes, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?">Isaiah 43:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>. It is hard to suppose that the king was so thoroughly versed in the Hebrew Scriptures that he should be able to make use of them as doxologies. This gives support to the conjecture that the letter was composed by Daniel and not by the king. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.</span> If the translator of the Septuagint had the Massoretic text before him, he has gone utterly away from it, and gives us a mere paraphrase, "And after seven years I gave my soul to prayer, and besought concerning my sins at the presence of the Lord, the God of heaven, and prayed concerning mine ignorances to the great God of gods." There is another version of this verse, for this which we have given has been misplaced. The verse which appears in the proper place, though also very different from the Massoretic, is as different from that we have just given, "And at the end of seven years the time of my redemption came, and my sins and mine ignorances were fulfilled before the God of heaven, and I besought concerning my ignorances the God of gods, and behold an angel out of heaven called to me, saying, Nebuchadnezzar, serve the holy God of heaven, and give glory to the Highest; the kingdom of thy nation has been restored to thee." The latter clause has the look of leading into the following verse. One cannot but feel that there is in both the work of the paraphrast, but at the same time, he seems, in both cases, to have been working with a different text from that of the Massoretes. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree accurately with the Massoretic. The sudden gleam of intelligence that broke the spell of madness is a perfectly natural termination to an attack like that under which Nebuchadnezzar suffered. The tranquillizing effect of prayer is well known. The ascription of praise in the liturgic formula here given is not unlike what we find in the Ninevite remains. Bevan suggests as a parallel, Euripides' 'Bacchae,' where there is a recovery from madness accompanied with looking up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But at the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;liq&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
