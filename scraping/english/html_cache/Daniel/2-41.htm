The feet and toes represent a kingdom that is both strong and fragile. Iron symbolizes strength and durability, often associated with the Roman Empire in biblical prophecy. Clay, on the other hand, represents fragility and weakness. The combination of these materials suggests a kingdom that is internally divided and unstable. This imagery reflects the historical reality of the Roman Empire, which was strong militarily but struggled with internal divisions and governance issues.<p><b>so this will be a divided kingdom</b><br>The divided nature of the kingdom is emphasized here. Historically, the Roman Empire was known for its vast expanse and diverse population, which often led to internal conflicts and divisions. This division can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the eventual split of the Roman Empire into the Western and Eastern Roman Empires. Theologically, this division can be interpreted as a representation of the spiritual and moral fragmentation that occurs when human kingdoms are not aligned with God's will.<p><b>yet some of the strength of iron will be in it</b><br>Despite its divisions, the kingdom retains some of the strength of iron. This suggests that while the kingdom is not as unified or strong as previous empires, it still possesses significant power and influence. The Roman Empire, despite its internal challenges, was able to maintain control over a vast territory for centuries. This strength can also be seen as a type of the enduring nature of human empires, which, despite their flaws, continue to exert influence over the world.<p><b>just as you saw the iron mixed with clay</b><br>The mixture of iron and clay highlights the inherent instability of the kingdom. This combination is unnatural and does not bond well, symbolizing the difficulties in maintaining unity and strength. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for the challenges faced by any human institution that tries to combine incompatible elements. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the limitations of human power and the ultimate sovereignty of God over all earthly kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and interpreter of dreams, who is given the ability to interpret King Nebuchadnezzar's dream.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who has a troubling dream about a statue made of various materials.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, representing the head of gold in the dream.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_statue.htm">The Statue</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of successive kingdoms, with feet and toes of iron and clay symbolizing a divided kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_divided_kingdom.htm">The Divided Kingdom</a></b><br>Represents a future kingdom that will be partly strong and partly fragile, as depicted by the mixture of iron and clay.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_human_kingdoms.htm">The Nature of Human Kingdoms</a></b><br>Human kingdoms, no matter how strong, are inherently unstable and divided.

It may be observed here that a clause is omitted from ver. 41, "but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron." In the forty-third verse the difference is due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> as infinitive of the verb "to sow," that is to say, the translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>. The addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> has had its origin in a false idea that the feet and toes of the image represented a new world-dominion. Theodotion renders, "Because (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potter's clay, and part of iron, a kingdom shall be divided, and there will be in it from the iron root in like manner as thou sawest the iron mingled with the potter's clay. And the toes of the feet were partly iron, and partly clay, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part of it shall be broken (being broken, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); because thou sawest the iron mingled with the potter's clay, there shall be mixings with the seed of men: but they shall not adhere one to another, even as iron is not mingled with clay." Neither in Syriac nor Chaldee has <span class="accented">netzab</span> the meaning "to be firm;" <span class="accented">nitzebthah</span> means, in later Aramaic, "a seedling." Originally, however, it meant "to confirm," "to set up," "to strengthen," as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">yatzab</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">natzab</span>). This meaning had been lost sight of by the time Theodotion wrote, or possibly before the translation was made which he revised. The Peshitta does not call for remark, save that it agrees with Theodotion in translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nitzeba-thah</span>) "root." Jerome renders it <span class="accented">plantarium.</span> This new development of the image is to be regarded, not as another empire, but as the outgrowth of the fourth kingdom. This is clear from the fact that there is no new substance introduced of which the feet and toes are wholly made up, but the iron is mingled with a new and inferior substance, potter's clay. The numerical mark "ten," which is to be regarded as the peculiar distinctive sign of the fourth empire, is in the toes. This last empire, whatever it may be taken to be, is one that splits itself up into approximately ten parts or sub-kingdoms. Further, there shall be a foreign element introduced which shall not harmonize with the original material. Professor Bevan is certain that the reference is "to the marriages of the Ptolemies with the Se-leucidae." Notwithstanding that Professor Bevan states this view as if it could not be doubted, it is evidently false. Both the Lagids and the Seleucids were Macedonians, and there was no natural incompatibility. If marriage is intended here, and if the fourth monarchy were the Hellenic, more sensible would have been the suggestion that it referred to the Hellenizing of South-Western Asia - the miscegenation of the peoples inaugurated by Alexander the Great, only it did not proceed very far. Further, it did not signalize the end of the Greek rule, but really the beginning of it. We admit certainly that the LXX. translates in a way that suggests the marriage of a superior with an inferior race. But there is no reference in reality to marriage, but to the mingling of two distinct culture-elements, the infusion of barbarous races into the midst of a civilized; and the barbarians taking on some of the outward forms of civilization would represent better the thing indicated. But to take this as referring to the marriage of the Seleucids and Lagids is certainly as wrong as wrong can be, although it is held by Moses Stuart, Hitzig, Ewald, as well as Professor Bevan. Not one of them shows which, the Seleucid or the Lagid, is "the clay," "the seed of men," and which the governing power or race that mingles with them. Yet the inferiority of the clay is an essential element in the symbolism. Hoffmann's idea, that there is reference to the marriage of the Emperor Otto II. and the Russian grandduke Wladimir with the daughters of the Byzantine emperor, is equally far-fetched. Certainly the intrusion into the Roman Empire of the Germanic tribes on the. one side, and of the Arabs and Turks on the other, is an interpretation much closer to the real meaning of the symbol. A good deal can be said for Dr. Bonnar's theory, that it is the effort of monarchy to rest on democracy. As to the number, <span class="accented">ten</span>, it is not to be made absolute; it may be more than ten or fewer than ten. All that is necessary is that the number be considerably more than four, and not so numerous as to suggest an indefinite multitude. The fact of "the toes" occupying the same portion of the image, seems to signify that these ten divisions were simultaneously existing. What is symbolized is clearly a state of matters not unlike what was in Greece after the defeat of the Persians, and before the Macedonian domination - a number of separate states forming part of one system. Such, to a certain extent, was the empire of the Diadochi, or successors of Alexander, only they were not generally more than four, five, or six - mainly four, the Seleucids, the Lagids, the Attalids, and the Anti-gonids. Such was the state of matters under the Holy Roman Empire, when what are now the six great powers were gradually separating themselves off. A similar state of matters existed at the same time among the Mohammedan powers, which acknowledged a certain suzerainty in the Caliph of Bagdad, but warred with each other with great freedom. While we have said that there is an appearance of simultaneity given to these monarchs or dynasties, candour compels us to acknowledge that they may be successive. We would not desire to anticipate what we say below in a special excursus on the four monarchies of Daniel; yet we may be permitted to indicate two senses in which the number <span class="accented">ten</span> may indicate Rome. There were <span class="accented">ten</span> emperors to the capture of Jerusalem, and the end of Judaism as a civil power, and the consequent independence of the Church from the trammels of Judaism. Further, a fair case might be made out for the different magistrates that exercised authority, more or less supreme, in Rome - consuls, praetors, dictators, magistri equitum, censors, tribunes. All these were replaced by the emperors. We merely indicate this, as we shall consider the subject more at large below. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And just as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun -
