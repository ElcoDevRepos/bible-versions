In biblical times, wine was a common beverage, but excessive consumption often led to poor decision-making. <a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> warns against the mockery and brawling that wine can cause, highlighting the dangers of drunkenness. This sets the stage for Belshazzar's reckless actions, contrasting with the wisdom and sobriety expected of a ruler.<p><b>Belshazzar gave orders</b><br>Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon, is depicted as a ruler who acts impulsively. Historically, he was a co-regent with his father Nabonidus, which explains why he is referred to as king. His actions here reflect a disregard for the sacred, foreshadowing the imminent fall of Babylon as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47:1-5</a>.<p><b>to bring in the gold and silver vessels</b><br>These vessels were sacred items from the temple in Jerusalem, taken by Nebuchadnezzar during the Babylonian conquest (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). Their use in a pagan feast symbolizes the desecration of what is holy, echoing the theme of sacrilege found in other parts of Scripture, such as the misuse of holy things in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>.<p><b>that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem</b><br>The term "father" here is used in a dynastic sense, as Nebuchadnezzar was actually Belshazzar's grandfather. This highlights the continuity of Babylonian rule and the ongoing impact of Nebuchadnezzar's conquests. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship, and its plundering fulfilled prophecies like those in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>.<p><b>so that the king could drink from them</b><br>This act of drinking from the sacred vessels is a direct affront to God, illustrating the theme of pride and blasphemy. It parallels other biblical accounts where leaders defy God, such as Pharaoh in Exodus. This act sets the stage for divine judgment, as seen later in the chapter.<p><b>along with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines</b><br>The inclusion of nobles, wives, and concubines in the feast underscores the communal nature of the sin and the widespread corruption in Babylon. It reflects the opulence and moral decay of the empire, reminiscent of the decadence of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.

The holiness God assigns to objects&#8212;and people&#8212;set apart for Him.<p>4. Corporate responsibility when leaders and followers unite in sin.<p>This single verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s swift response, reminding us that He still defends His honor and judges prideful desecration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Whiles he tasted--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> while he was enjoying the wine. The sacred vessels were brought out of the temple of Merodach, and profaned in this manner for the purpose of defying Jehovah. But it may be reasonably asked, What led him to think of Jehovah in the midst of the revelry? It may have been that some drunken fancy seized him. It may have been that he had been warned that the prophets of Jehovah had foretold the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus, whose armies were now in the neighbourhood. Whatever the true explanation may be, there can be no doubt, from Daniel's language (<a href="/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>), and from the way in which Belshazzar's gods are mentioned (<a href="/daniel/5-4.htm" title="They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.">Daniel 5:4</a>), that the whole act was one of defiance of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</span> The Septuagint has included the last clause of the Massoretic recension of the first verse, "And he drank wine, and his heart was lifted up, and he commanded to bring the vessels of gold and of silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from Jerusalem, and to pour out wine in them for those companions of his (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The translator seems to have regarded the first syllable of the name Belshazzar as a separate word, and has translated it according to the meaning the word has in Eastern Aramaic, "heart" (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, Peshitta). After this initial mistake - if mistake it was - the remaining change was easy. The syntax here, according to the Massoretic text, is different from what we should expect. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> ('<span class="accented">amar</span>), "to say," is translated "command" in eight cases in this book, and in every other case it is followed immediately by the infinitive' of the action commanded. Hence we are inclined, with the LXX., to omit "whiles he tasted the wine." While the LXX. Aramaic seems to have <span class="aramaic">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "in them," it has not had "king," "wives," or "concubines." As the Septuagint is the shorter, on the whole, we prefer it, though we maintain the Massoretic reading of "in them," referring to the vessels. Theodotion and the Peshitta follow the Massoretic reading. Whether or not the libation offered to the gods was in the mind of the writer, the mere fact that the sacred vessels were used for the purposes of a common feast was desecration. The addition of the "wives" and "concubines" adds at once to the degradation in the eyes of an Eastern, and to the stately rhetorical cadence of the verse. This renders all the stronger the suspicion engendered by the omission of these features in the Septuagint. It is to be observed that the Septuagint translator must have had an Eastern Aramaic manuscript before him, or he could never have translated <span class="accented">bal</span> "heart." At the same time, the presence of women at Babylonian feasts was not so uncommon as it was in the rest of the East, as we learn from the Ninevite remains. Certainly Quintus Curtius mentions this in connection with Alexander's visit to Babylon (v. 1). But was an obscure Jew likely to know this in Palestine? It is very difficult for a person writing in a different age to keep strictly to verisimilitude in these matters. Even a contemporary may make a blunder in writing, not a novel, but a biography, as Froude, in his 'Life of Carlyle,' declares he was "quietly married in the parish church of Temple." To be <span class="accented">quietly</span> married in a parish church in any part of Scotland, in the early years of this century, would be a contradiction in terms. Yet Froude had often been in Scotland, and knew Carlyle well. Could a Jew living in Palestine have all his wits about him so as to note every varying feature which distinguished the habits of Babylon from those of the rest of the East? The question may be asked why were the vessels of the Lord in Jerusalem singled out to be desecrated by a common use? It might, of course, be that the sacred vessels of the temples of the gods of all conquered nationalities were brought in, and thus that the singling out of the Jewish sacred vessels was due, not to the preference of the Babylonian monarch, but to the Jew, who saw only those. We think this can scarcely be. It was certainly the policy of Nabunahid to draw all worship to Babylon (Annals of Nabunahid, col. 3. line 20, "The gods of Akkad, which Nabunabid had brought to Babylon, were carried back to their city"). But this would lead him to avoid anything that would savour of disrespect to these gods whom he had brought to dwell in Babylon. We do not think it would have been merely the beauty of those vessels that led to their desecration, for the temple at Jerusalem had suffered several plunderings before the capture of the city, and the period between the age of Hezekiah and Zedekiah was not one in which wealth and artistic talent were likely to increase. Some suspicion must have reached the court of Babylon that the Jews were in league with Cyrus; perhaps the contents of the second Isaiah had reached the knowledge of the Babylonian police. If so, the act of Belshazzar was an act of defiance against Jehovah of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Under the influence of the wine,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;am&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2562.htm">Strong's 2562: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Belshazzar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1113.htm">Strong's 1113: </a> </span><span class="str2">Belshazzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gave orders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;
