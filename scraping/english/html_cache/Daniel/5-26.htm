It highlights Daniel's role as a prophet and interpreter of God's messages, a role seen throughout the book of Daniel. This moment underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the ability of God to reveal hidden truths, as seen in other instances such as Joseph interpreting dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>MENE</b><br>The term "MENE" is an Aramaic word meaning "numbered." It signifies God's precise control over time and events. The repetition of the word in the original text emphasizes the certainty and finality of God's judgment. This concept of divine numbering is echoed in <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to "number our days" to gain wisdom.<p><b>means that God has numbered the days of your reign</b><br>This phrase indicates that God has set a limit to the reign of Belshazzar, the Babylonian king. It reflects the biblical theme that earthly kingdoms are temporary and subject to God's ultimate authority. Historically, this aligns with the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>. The idea that God numbers the days of rulers is also seen in <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, where it is stated that God determines the length of a person's life.<p><b>and brought it to an end.</b><br>The conclusion of this message is the impending end of Belshazzar's reign, which is fulfilled that very night (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>). This serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and idolatry, themes prevalent in the book of Daniel. The fall of Babylon is a type of the ultimate fall of all earthly powers before the kingdom of God, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>. This phrase also points to the eschatological hope of God's eternal kingdom, which will replace all human kingdoms, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the time of <a href="/bsb/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.

This serves as a warning against pride and self-reliance, urging believers to humble themselves before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Daniel's role as the interpreter highlights the value of remaining faithful to God amidst a corrupt society.

Just as in <a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>&#8212;&#8220;there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries&#8221;&#8212;the Lord again unveils what human wisdom cannot.<p>- Joseph voiced the same confidence in <a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, reminding fellow prisoners, &#8220;Do not interpretations belong to God?&#8221; The pattern is clear: whenever God speaks, He also clarifies.<p>- This assures us today that Scripture means what it says. We do not need to dilute or revise it; we simply receive and relay it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>MENE</b><p>- The single word appears twice on the wall (v. 25), underscoring urgency. Repetition in Scripture often signals emphasis, much like Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Truly, truly&#8221; in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>.<p>- &#8220;Mene&#8221; means &#8220;numbered.&#8221; <a href="/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a> agrees: &#8220;Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with You&#8230;&#8221; Every pulse is on God&#8217;s timetable.<p>- <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a> adds that all our days &#8220;were written in Your book before one of them came to be.&#8221; Kings and commoners alike live on a divine countdown.<p>- <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>&#8217;s rich fool learned this overnight: &#8220;This very night your life will be required of you.&#8221; The handwriting on Belshazzar&#8217;s wall offers the same sobering reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God has numbered the days of your reign</b><p>- The declaration is specific: not merely numbering Belshazzar&#8217;s life, but his reign.
