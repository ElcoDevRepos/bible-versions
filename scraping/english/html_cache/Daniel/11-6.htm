This alliance is a strategic move to consolidate power and influence in the region. The historical context involves the ongoing conflicts between these Hellenistic kingdoms following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. The alliance is a temporary solution to ongoing hostilities, reflecting the fragile nature of political agreements in the ancient world.<p><b>and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to seal the agreement</b><br>The daughter mentioned here is historically identified as Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt. She was given in marriage to Antiochus II Theos of the Seleucid Empire to solidify the alliance. This practice of using marriage to secure political alliances was common in the ancient Near East. The cultural context highlights the role of women in diplomacy, often used as pawns in the power struggles of their male relatives.<p><b>But his daughter will not retain her position of power</b><br>Berenice's inability to retain her position of power is a result of the political intrigue and betrayal that followed her marriage. After the death of Ptolemy II, Antiochus II took back his former wife, Laodice, who then orchestrated the murder of Berenice and her son. This phrase underscores the precarious nature of political alliances and the vulnerability of those used to secure them.<p><b>nor will his strength endure</b><br>This refers to the eventual downfall of Antiochus II's power. The political instability and internal strife within the Seleucid Empire weakened its strength. The phrase can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy, illustrating the transient nature of human power and the ultimate sovereignty of God over the affairs of nations.<p><b>At that time she will be given up, along with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her</b><br>This phrase indicates the complete failure of the alliance and the tragic end of Berenice and her supporters. Historically, Berenice, her son, and her attendants were killed, and her father, Ptolemy II, had already died. The phrase highlights the futility of human schemes against divine prophecy. It also serves as a reminder of the cost of political machinations and the often brutal outcomes for those involved. Theologically, it can be seen as a type of the ultimate justice and judgment that God will bring upon the earth, as seen in other prophetic scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_south.htm">King of the South</a></b><br>Refers to the ruler of Egypt, historically associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>Refers to the ruler of the Seleucid Empire, which was located in the region of modern-day Syria and surrounding areas.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_the_king_of_the_south.htm">Daughter of the King of the South</a></b><br>Historically, this is believed to be Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy II of Egypt, who was given in marriage to Antiochus II of the Seleucid Empire.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/alliance.htm">Alliance</a></b><br>A political marriage intended to create peace and strengthen ties between the two kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/betrayal_and_downfall.htm">Betrayal and Downfall</a></b><br>The failure of the alliance and the subsequent betrayal and downfall of Berenice and her supporters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_alliances.htm">The Futility of Human Alliances</a></b><br>Human alliances, especially those based on political expediency, are often fragile and unreliable.

Scripture&#8217;s accuracy affirms God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty over nations and alliances, reminding believers to place trust not in human schemes but in the Lord who knows the end from the beginning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">In the end.--</span>Comp. <a href="/daniel/11-8.htm" title="And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.">Daniel 11:8</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm" title="For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.">Daniel 11:13</a>, and <a href="/2_chronicles/18-2.htm" title="And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.">2Chronicles 18:2</a>. Here again the reference is most obscure. If the "joining themselves together" refers to the marriage of Antiochus II. with Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and if "the agreement" (comp. "upright ones," <a href="/daniel/11-17.htm" title="He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.">Daniel 11:17</a>) refers to the terms of the marriage, which were that Antiochus should put away his former wife Laodice, and appoint her firstborn son successor to the throne, then it must be remarked that history is irreconcilable with the prophecy. Also it appears from <a href="/daniel/10-14.htm" title="Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.">Daniel 10:14</a> that this revelation bears upon the future of Israel, and it does not appear that this marriage affected the Jewish people more than any other marriage. This, and the fact that a period of more than fifty years intervened between the events supposed to be implied in <a href="/context/daniel/11-5.htm" title="And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.">Daniel 11:5-6</a>, make the traditional interpretation very unsatisfactory. The language refers to what is mentioned as one of the characteristics of the last empire (<a href="/daniel/2-43.htm" title="And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.">Daniel 2:43</a>), various attempts to consolidate earthly powers by political marriages. These do not characterise the era of the Seleucidae any more than they do the times of Ahab, or many other periods of history. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</span> The LXX. differs in a remarkable way from this, "And at the end of years he shall lead them, and the King of Egypt shall enter into the kingdom of the north to make covenants: but he shall not prevail, because his arm shall not establish strength (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;</span>); and his arm shall become stiff, and that of those accompanying him, and he shall remain for a season (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." It is certainly difficult to see the reading from which this rendering came. It is noticeable that there is no reference to "the king's daughter of the south." History confirms the statement in the Massoretic text, but there is no expedition related in the history of Philadelphus undertaken against the kingdom of Syria. It is trite our records of the reign of Philadelphus are somewhat scanty. Theodotion is nearer the Massoretic text, though not quite in accordance with it, "And after his Jays they shall mingle with one another (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and the daughter of the king of the south shall enter unto the king of the north to make treaties with him: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; and his seed shall not stand: and she shall be betrayed, and those that brought her, both the damsel and he that did violence to her." The last words are separated from this verse and conjoined to the following verse. The text behind this seems, in many ways, superior to the Massoretic. The Peshitta agrees in the opening clauses with the Massoretic; at the end of the verse the difference is considerable, "But power shall not be in her, from the fear which she feared: and she shall be betrayed, and her youths, and those accompanying her, and those supporting her in this time." The Vulgate agrees pretty closely with this. The reference here is generally understood to be to the affinity made by the Lagids with the Seleucids, when Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphns, married Antiochus II. (Theos), who repudiated his first wife, Laodike, in order to do so. The leap over a space of approximately sixty years is not so trying as Professor Fuller imagines; but the uncertainty as to the text is great, and the meaning of even the Massoretic is by no means fixed. Still, the agreement with the course of events is so marked according to the common interpretation, that one feels inclined to adopt it. After the death of her father Philadelphus, Antiochus Theos took back Laodike, who, in order to escape the risk of being again dismissed, unceremoniously poisoned her rival Berenice and her <span class="accented">son</span>, and then her husband Antiochus. Yet this transaction seems somewhat dubiously set forth in the Massoretic text. Theodotion is closer to facts, though it is possible that the text has been altered to suit what were known to be facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1444;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
