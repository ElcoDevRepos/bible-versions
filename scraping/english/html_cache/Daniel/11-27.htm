Historically, this could be Antiochus IV Epiphanes of the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemy VI of Egypt. Their hearts being "bent on evil" suggests deceitful intentions and a lack of integrity, reflecting the broader theme of human sinfulness and the corrupt nature of political power. This aligns with the biblical understanding of the human heart as deceitful (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><b>will speak lies at the same table,</b><br>The imagery of speaking lies at the same table indicates a diplomatic meeting or negotiation where deceit is prevalent. This reflects the historical context of political alliances and treaties that were often fraught with betrayal and ulterior motives. The table symbolizes a place of supposed peace and agreement, yet it is marred by dishonesty, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where even close companions can betray.<p><b>but to no avail,</b><br>Despite their deceitful plans, their efforts will ultimately fail. This highlights the futility of human schemes against the divine plan. It echoes the biblical principle that human plans are subject to God's sovereign will (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>). The phrase reassures believers that evil, no matter how cunning, cannot thwart God's purposes.<p><b>for still the end will come at the appointed time.</b><br>This emphasizes the certainty and sovereignty of God's timing in the unfolding of history. The "appointed time" suggests a divinely ordained schedule, reinforcing the prophetic nature of Daniel's visions. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's control over history and the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> and <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>.

The context is opposed to any reference to the combination of Antiochus and Philometor against Physcon (see Livy, xlv. 11; Polyb. xxix. 8). The object of the paragraph is to show that the southern king was attempting to fight his rival with his own weapons--viz., deceit--but the plots of each king fail.<p><span class= "bld">For yet</span> . . .--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the end of each will come only at the time definitely ordained by God for the consummation of His kingdom (<a href="/daniel/11-35.htm" title="And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.">Daniel 11:35</a>). Man cannot hasten the events decreed by God's providence. For an interesting commentary, read <a href="/context/isaiah/18-4.htm" title="For so the LORD said to me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat on herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.">Isaiah 18:4-6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</span> The Septuagint Version is, "And two kings shall dine alone at the same time, and eat at one table, and they shall speak lies, and they shall not prosper." The translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5d1;&#x5dd;</span>. Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic, agreeing in this with the Peshitta and Vulgate. The probable reference is to Ptolemy Philometor, conveyed practically a prisoner with his uncle's army, while Epiphanes carried on his invasion of Egypt. They dined at one table, and probably deceived each the other. The purpose of Ptolemy was to get his usurping brother Physcon dethroned; the object of Antiochus was to <span class="accented">possess</span> Egypt for himself. Rashi sees in this a reference to the quarrels and reconciliations which diversified the conflict between John Hyrcanus II. and his brother Aristobulns. Jephet-ibn-Alimakes the two kings mean Arabia and Rome, since, according to him, these are respectively the kings of the south and of the north. <span class="accented">Yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</span> The progress of Antiochus was interrupted by the Romans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the two</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
