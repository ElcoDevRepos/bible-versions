In the context of <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon is the current ruler, and the prophecy foretells the rise of subsequent kingdoms. This reflects the transient nature of earthly power and the sovereignty of God over history.<p><b>there will arise another kingdom,</b><br>The "another kingdom" refers to the Medo-Persian Empire, which succeeded Babylon. Historically, this transition occurred when Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This change of power is significant in biblical history, as it led to the eventual return of the Jewish exiles to Jerusalem, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>.<p><b>inferior to yours.</b><br>The term "inferior" suggests a decline in the quality or strength of the subsequent kingdom compared to Babylon. While the Medo-Persian Empire was larger in territory, it lacked the same centralized power and cultural influence as Babylon. This inferiority may also refer to the symbolic representation in the statue from Nebuchadnezzar's dream, where silver (Medo-Persia) is considered less valuable than gold (Babylon).<p><b>Next, a third kingdom,</b><br>The "third kingdom" is identified as the Greek Empire, established by Alexander the Great. This empire followed the Medo-Persian Empire and is known for its rapid expansion and cultural influence, spreading Hellenistic culture across the known world. The Greek Empire's rise is a fulfillment of the prophetic sequence outlined in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>.<p><b>one of bronze,</b><br>Bronze, in the statue from Nebuchadnezzar's dream, symbolizes the Greek Empire. Bronze is stronger than silver, indicating the military prowess and strategic capabilities of the Greeks. This aligns with historical accounts of Alexander's conquests and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, known as the Diadochi.<p><b>will rule the whole earth.</b><br>This phrase highlights the extensive reach of the Greek Empire under Alexander the Great, who conquered territories from Greece to Egypt and as far east as India. While "the whole earth" is hyperbolic, it emphasizes the unprecedented scope of Greek influence during this period. This expansion facilitated the spread of Greek language and culture, which later played a crucial role in the dissemination of the Gospel in the New Testament era, as seen in the widespread use of Koine Greek.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had the dream of the statue, which Daniel interprets.

The second kingdom is the Medo-Persian (as appears more fully below, <span class= "ital">Exc.</span> E). The inferiority is to be found in the divided character of that empire, as compared with the massive solidity of its predecessor. This is signified in the image, partly by the inferiority of the metal, silver instead of gold, and partly by the symbol of division, the <span class= "ital">two</span> breasts opposed to the <span class= "ital">one</span> head. It must not be forgotten that in other respects, such as extent of territory and duration of empire, the Medo-Persian far exceeded the Babylonian kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Another third.</span>--The metal implies a certain inferiority, but the phrase "shall bear rule over the whole earth" speaks of an empire that extended further than the preceding. This is the Graeco-Macedonian Empire (see <span class= "ital">Exc.</span> E, and comp. <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm" title="After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.">Daniel 7:6</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/8-5.htm" title="And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.">Daniel 8:5-7</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> None of the versions presents any difficulties, or gives occasion for any remark, save the Vulgate, which inserts <span class="accented">argenteum</span>, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e1;&#x5e4;</span>. The word used, "kingdom," not "king," shows, without possibility of reasonable dispute, that in identifying Nebuchadnezzar with the head of gold, the reference is not to him per-serially, but to him as representing his dynasty. The next dynasty is said to be inferior, that is to <span class="accented">say</span>, nearer the ground <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">ar'a</span>), which is certainly true of the shoulders in relation to the head. Not only does the inferior metal imply inferiority, but the inferior position dues so also. The metal is omitted here, but stated in the next clause, <span class="accented">Another third kingdom of brass</span>, <span class="accented">which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> The metal is here referred to, but not the position; there is no need to say it is inferior - that is implied when it is said to be a kingdom of brass. We need only refer to what we have said above, as to the fact that "brass" here really means "copper." As the inferiority stated in the first clause is omitted in the second, so the statement made at the end, which grammatically applies only to the third kingdom, applies also to the second. It is only as, in a sense, bearing rule over the whole earth, that any monarchy comes into this statue at all. When we look at these two, we find certainly the two arms suggesting and rendering emphatic a twofoldness of some sort in this power. The fact that, in the description of the statue, the word translated "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>) is plural, suggests, along with the <span class="accented">two</span> thighs, the idea of four-foldness. Faintly is this suggestion made, but the exigencies of the figure must be considered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But after you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
