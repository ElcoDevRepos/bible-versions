The "sixty-two weeks" follow an initial period of seven weeks, making a total of sixty-nine weeks. These weeks are understood as symbolic of years, with each week representing seven years. This period is significant in biblical prophecy, marking the time from the decree to rebuild Jerusalem to the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing</b><br>The term "cut off" is often interpreted as referring to the death of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was crucified. This aligns with the New Testament accounts of Jesus' crucifixion, where He was rejected by His people and died without earthly possessions or kingdom. The phrase "will have nothing" emphasizes the apparent failure of His mission from a worldly perspective, as He did not establish an earthly kingdom at that time.<p><b>Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary</b><br>This part of the prophecy is commonly associated with the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple in 70 AD by the Romans. The "people of the prince who is to come" are understood to be the Roman forces under General Titus. The "prince" is often interpreted as a future ruler or antichrist figure, suggesting a dual fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>The end will come like a flood</b><br>The imagery of a flood suggests suddenness and overwhelming destruction. This can be seen in the historical context of the Roman siege of Jerusalem, which was swift and devastating. The flood metaphor is also used in other biblical prophecies to describe judgment and destruction, such as in <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>.<p><b>and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of ongoing conflict and devastation for Jerusalem and the Jewish people. Historically, this has been seen in the numerous conflicts and hardships faced by the Jewish nation throughout history. The term "decreed" suggests divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's prophetic plan, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a> and <a href="/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27-28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointed_one.htm">The Anointed One (Messiah)</a></b><br>Refers to the promised Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is prophesied to be "cut off," indicating His crucifixion and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_prince.htm">The People of the Prince</a></b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as referring to the Roman people, who under the leadership of their generals, destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 AD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prince_who_is_to_come.htm">The Prince Who is to Come</a></b><br>This is often seen as a reference to a future leader or antichrist figure, who will arise from the same people who destroyed the city and sanctuary.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_and_the_sanctuary.htm">The City and the Sanctuary</a></b><br>Refers to Jerusalem and the Holy Temple, which were destroyed by the Romans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/desolations.htm">Desolations</a></b><br>This term indicates the ongoing state of destruction and conflict that will persist until the end times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of prophecy in the Bible and how it points to the fulfillment in Jesus Christ.

Observe the care with which the seventy weeks are arranged in a series of the form 7 + 62 + 1. During the period of seven weeks Jerusalem is to be rebuilt. The "troublous times" are not to be restricted to this period, but may apply to the sixty-two weeks which follow. After the end of the sixty-nine weeks Messiah is to be cut off. By "Messiah" we must understand the same person who is spoken of in <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>. It should also be observed that the word "prince," which is applied to Messiah in <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm" title="Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.">Daniel 9:25</a>, is here used of another person--some secular prince, who stands in opposition to the Messiah. The Greek versions render "unction" instead of "anointed," whence Jacob of Edessa explains "the cutting off" to mean "the cessation of the unction by which judgment and sovereignty were established." The word "to cut off," however, applies to a person more appropriately than to a thing. It is frequently used of excommunication, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/exodus/30-33.htm" title="Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.">Exodus 30:33</a>;
