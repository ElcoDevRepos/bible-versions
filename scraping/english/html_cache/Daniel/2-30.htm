In biblical context, mysteries often refer to divine truths that are hidden and can only be understood through divine revelation (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-5</a>). This emphasizes God's sovereignty and the role of prophets as His chosen vessels to communicate His will.<p><b>not because I have more wisdom than any man alive</b><br>Daniel humbly denies any personal credit for the revelation, attributing it solely to God's grace. This humility is consistent with biblical teachings that wisdom and understanding come from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). Daniel's attitude contrasts with the pride often seen in Babylonian culture, where wisdom and knowledge were highly prized and often attributed to human achievement.<p><b>but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king</b><br>The purpose of the revelation is to communicate God's message to King Nebuchadnezzar. This reflects the biblical theme of God using His servants to speak to rulers and authorities (<a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7:1-2</a>). It also highlights the importance of prophecy in revealing God's plans and purposes to those in power, as seen in other instances like Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dreams (Genesis 41).<p><b>and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind</b><br>The revelation is intended to provide clarity and understanding to Nebuchadnezzar regarding his own thoughts and concerns. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that God knows the hearts and minds of all people (<a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>) and can provide insight and understanding beyond human capability. It also points to the role of prophecy in addressing the inner thoughts and anxieties of individuals, offering divine perspective and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams through God's revelation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and his friends were exiled, known for its grandeur and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A mysterious vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, symbolizing future kingdoms and God's ultimate sovereignty.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_revelation.htm">God's Revelation</a></b><br>The divine act of revealing hidden truths to Daniel, emphasizing God's control over human history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Daniel acknowledges that the revelation is not due to his own wisdom.

The Septuagint Version is simpler, "But as for me, not on account of any wisdom in me above all men is this mystery revealed, but in order that it should be shown to the king it is revealed to me what thou thoughtest in thy heart in knowledge." The translator has read the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>. There is no reference to "those who shall show the interpretation." The text before him may have omitted the plural termination; consequently, the huphal was supplied. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and Jerome all agree pretty closely with the Massoretic text, but all make the verb translated "<span class="accented">shows"</span> singular, not plural, as does the Massoretic. Of course, it may be that this was due to rendering the sense, not the words, of the original; but Theodotion especially is more prone in any difficulty to slavish adherence to his original. His rendering is, "But as for me, not for wisdom which is in me beyond all living is the mystery revealed, but that the interpretation be made known to the king in order that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart." The Pe-shitta renders the latter clauses thus: "But that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know what thou didst meditate on in thy heart." Jerome, after rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">raza</span>, "secret") <span class="accented">sacra-mentum</span>, proceeds," Sed ut interpretatio regi manifesta fieret et cogitationes mentis tuae seires." The fact that the last word takes the Mandaitic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tin'dae</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tidda</span>') indicates on the whole an Oriental origin. The use of the plural form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yehod'un</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> wrongly rendered, "for their sakes who shall make known the interpretation." The Revised Version is more accurate, "but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known;" and Luther translates, "Dass dem Konige die Deutung augezeiget warde." The use of the plural for the indefinite occurs elsewhere (Wirier, &sect; 49). The position Daniel takes up is one which does not separate him from the other <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> of the court. He in effect says, "I am no wiser than the other sages who have been condemned to death, only the God of heaven can reveal what the king demands, and he has revealed it to me." The purpose of the revelation, "that thou mightest know the interpretation," is fitted to soothe his pride. The humility of Daniel has been remarked in reference to this verse. He puts himself behind the impersonal form, "in order that people may show the king the interpretation." The reason why the interpretation was shown to Nebuchadnezzar might be really to humble him, to show him that his empire, splendid as it was, was only one in a succession, and that the whole system of world-empires would be overthrown before a kingdom set up by the God of the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And to me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
