Historically, this could refer to a ruler or leader who abandons the deities worshiped by his ancestors, which was a radical move in ancient cultures where continuity of worship was common. In the context of Daniel, this is often interpreted as a prophecy about a future ruler who will reject the established religious norms. This can be connected to the broader theme in Daniel of rulers who defy God, such as Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, who both faced consequences for their pride and idolatry.<p><b>nor for the one desired by women</b><br>This phrase has been subject to various interpretations. Some suggest it refers to a specific deity, possibly Tammuz or Adonis, who was associated with fertility and was particularly revered by women in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Others interpret it as a reference to the Messiah, whom Jewish women desired to be the mother of, thus indicating a rejection of the messianic hope. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the Antichrist figure who opposes Christ and His followers.<p><b>nor for any other god</b><br>This indicates a total rejection of all forms of deity, suggesting an atheistic or self-deifying stance. In the historical context of Daniel, this could be seen as a ruler who places himself above all religious systems, similar to the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the Jewish temple. This behavior is echoed in the New Testament's depiction of the Antichrist, who exalts himself above all that is called God (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p><b>because he will magnify himself above them all</b><br>This phrase highlights the pride and self-exaltation of the figure in question, a common theme in biblical prophecy concerning end-times rulers. This self-magnification is reminiscent of Lucifer's fall due to pride (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>) and is a direct challenge to the sovereignty of God. In the context of Daniel, it serves as a warning against the dangers of hubris and the ultimate downfall that comes from setting oneself above God, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, including the accounts of the Tower of Babel and the pride of Herod Agrippa.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This passage refers to a king who is characterized by his arrogance and self-exaltation.

The northern king appears twice again in Palestine (<a href="/daniel/11-41.htm" title="He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.">Daniel 11:41</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-45.htm" title="And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.">Daniel 11:45</a>), and apparently dies there. He discards his hereditary religion, he has no regard to that natural affection which women look upon as most desirable, but exalts himself over all.<p><span class= "bld">Desire of women.</span>--The language used by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9</a>), "delectable things," has led some commentators to think that an idol is here intended. It has been stated that the allusion is to the Asiatic goddess of nature, Mylitta, who, again, has been identified with the "queen of heaven" (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>, where see Notes). The context, however, leads us rather to think of human affection, or some other thing highly prized by women, for the words "neither shall he regard any god" would be unmeaning if a god were designated by "the desire of women." It should be remembered that according to Polybius xxvi. 10, sec. 11, Antiochus exceeded all kings in the sacrifices which he offered at the gates, and in the honours which he paid to the gods.<p><span class= "bld">In his estate--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the place of the God whom he has rejected, he will worship the "god of forces." There is no reason for taking this to be a proper name, as is done by the Syriac translator and Theodotion. It can only mean "fortresses" (see margin), so that the whole religion of this king is the taking of fortresses. To him war is everything, and to war everything else must give way. To war, as if it were a god, he does honour with all his wealth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all</span>. The Septuagint rendering is, "And to the gods of his fathers he will not have respect, and to the desire of women he will not have respect, because in everything he shall be exalted, and by him strong nations shall be subdued." The last clause belongs really to the next verse, of the first clause of which it is a variant reading. Theodotion is nearly identical in sense with this, "And no god of his fathers will he regard (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and a desire of women." "This clause stands thus incomplete, as if the translator would have finished it with (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) "to him" - "he regards no god, because over all he is exalted." The Peshitta rendering is, "And to the god of his fathers he shall not have regard; nor to the desire of women, nor any god, will he have respect; but over all he shall exalt himself." It is to be noted that the Peshitta renders as does the English Version, and has the singular, "the <span class="accented">God</span> of his fathers," not as the Greek versions, "the gods of his." The Hebrew might be either. The Vulgate agrees here with the Syriac. <span class="accented">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers.</span> Antiochus is looked upon, not as a man of Macedonian or Greek descent, but as a Syrian, and certainly he had no reverence for the ancient gods of Syria. His opposition to the theocracy and to the worship of Jehovah was but a portion of a wide policy, the object of which was the abolition of all local cults. <span class="accented">The desire of women.</span> It might mean that he was not lustful; but there is no evidence that, like Charles XII., he was abstinent. On the ether hand, he never neglected war for luxury, as did some of the Hellenic kings. Moreover, it is almost imperative that it be an object of worship that is here referred to. Taking "the desire of women" as an object of worship, there is an interpretation which has come down to us from Ephrem Syrus and Jerome, that Beltis or Nanaea is here referred to; and the fact that in an attempt to plunder the temple of this goddess, in Elymais, Antiochus lost his life, supports this view. The worship is said to have been very lascivious. On the other hand, it was a worship that would not naturally be prominent to a Palestinian Jew. The suggestion of Ewald, that it was the worship of Adonis or Tammuz which Antiochus despised, is more likely to be meant here. <span class="accented">For he shall magnify himself above all.</span> Claiming the right of annulling worship, and taking the sacred utensils from the temple treasures, he allowed himself to be addressed by the Samaritans as a god. Antiochus was probably utterly without faith in the Divine; worship was merely policy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will show no regard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_995.htm">Strong's 995: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate mentally, understand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
