His declarations are considered authoritative and divinely inspired. This phrase introduces a vision, a common method through which God communicated with His prophets. Daniel's role as a prophet is significant, as he serves as a mouthpiece for God's revelations during a tumultuous period in Israel's history.<p><b>In my vision in the night I looked,</b><br>Visions in the night often indicate divine revelation, as seen in other biblical accounts such as those of Joseph and Jacob. Night visions suggest a supernatural encounter, distinct from dreams, and are often used to convey messages of future events. Daniel's visions are apocalyptic, revealing God's sovereignty over history and future kingdoms.<p><b>and suddenly the four winds of heaven</b><br>The four winds symbolize God's sovereign power over the entire earth, as they come from all directions. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a> and <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>, to denote God's control over nations and events. The suddenness emphasizes the unexpected and divine nature of the events about to unfold.<p><b>were churning up the great sea.</b><br>The great sea often represents chaos and the nations of the world in biblical literature. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the sea was seen as a symbol of disorder and danger. The churning indicates turmoil and upheaval, setting the stage for the emergence of the four beasts, which represent successive empires. This imagery connects to other prophetic literature, such as <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>, where the sea also symbolizes the origin of worldly powers opposed to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_winds_of_heaven.htm">Four Winds of Heaven</a></b><br>Symbolic of divine forces or powers that influence the earth.

This underlines both the authenticity and reliability of the prophecy (cf. <a href="/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>; 12:5). Just as <a href="/daniel/2-45.htm">Daniel 2:45</a> records Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dream &#8220;made known&#8221; by God, Daniel now shares what God showed him, establishing a pattern: the Lord reveals, Daniel records, believers receive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In my vision in the night I looked</b><p>Night-time visions highlight the supernatural origin of the message, contrasting the darkness around Daniel with the light God supplies (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>; <a href="/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel is passive&#8212;he &#8220;looked&#8221;&#8212;while God actively discloses truth (<a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition of night visions throughout Scripture assures us the Lord communicates clearly, even when circumstances seem bleak (<a href="/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up</b><p>The &#8220;four winds&#8221; represent God&#8217;s sovereign forces operating in every direction of creation (<a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1-5</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-1.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Suddenly&#8221; signals an unexpected, uncontrollable stirring of world affairs.<p>&#8226; Like a divine hurricane, these winds agitate the status quo, preparing the stage for the rise and fall of empires described in the verses that follow (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Though turbulent, the winds obey heaven&#8217;s command, reminding us that history is never random but guided by God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the great sea</b><p>Throughout Scripture the sea pictures restless humanity and Gentile nations (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; 17:15).<p>&#8226; Historically, the &#8220;great sea&#8221; often refers to the Mediterranean, the geographic arena of the coming empires (<a href="/daniel/8-8.htm">Daniel 8:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it conveys the chaos and instability of a world detached from God&#8212;yet even this commotion is under His control (<a href="/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3-4</a>; <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>).<p>&#8226; From this churning sea emerge the four beasts of <a href="/bsb/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, literal kingdoms that rise in succession, fulfilling God&#8217;s prophetic timetable (<a href="/daniel/7-3.htm">Daniel 7:3</a>; 2:37-44).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a> portrays God unsettling the nations so His prophetic purposes unfold. Daniel faithfully records a night vision in which the four winds&#8212;divine forces&#8212;whip the great sea of humanity into turmoil, setting the stage for the rise of four world empires. The verse reminds us that no matter how chaotic international events appear, the Lord of heaven directs every current and gust, fulfilling His plan for history and ultimately for Christ&#8217;s eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The great sea.--</span>In general (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/joshua/15-47.htm" title="Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, to the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof:">Joshua 15:47</a>), these words imply the Mediterranean. Such cannot be the meaning here, so that according to <a href="/daniel/7-17.htm" title="These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.">Daniel 7:17</a> we are justified in explaining the "sea" to mean the nations of the world, which are compared to the sea (<a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm" title="In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-3.htm" title="Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.">Psalm 46:3</a>). The raging of the winds from the four quarters of the sky points to the various political and social agitations which disturb the world's history, and lead to the changes and revolutions which mark its progress as it tends towards the end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea</span>. The Septuagint omits the introductory clause, and renders, "On my couch I saw in my night-sleep, and, behold, the four winds of heaven fell upon the great sea." Theodotion, like the LXX., omits the introductory clause, and renders, "I Daniel beheld, and, lo, the four winds of the heaven rushed upon (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the great sea." The Peshitta seems as if transferred from the Massoretic text, the resemblance is so close. The variations in the Greek Version may be due to condensation of a fuller narrative. The verb translated "strove" in our Authorized Version is better rendered, as in the Revised, "brake forth upon." Luther's version is, "sturmeten wider einander." This, like the Authorized Version, seems to be the result of the Vulgate <span class="accented">pugnabant.</span> The only objection to this is that it ought to be followed by a preposition (Bevan). The translation suggested by Levy, "stirred up," appears still better. The sea referred to is naturally to be taken as the Mediterranean; it is "the great sea" of the prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>). Jerusalem is not so far from the sea but that Daniel might have seen it in his boyhood. The symbolic meaning of the sea is the mass of heathen nations (<a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>). The "four winds of heaven" usually stand for the points of the compass (<a href="/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>). Here, however, the winds are pictured as actual forces dashing down upon the sea, and stirring it up to its depths. It may be objected that this is an impossible picture. It might be replied that Virgil, in the first book of the 'AEneid,' 84-86, and Milton, in 'Paradise Regained,' has the same thing. Daniel has more freedom, for he narrates a vision, and, further, to him the winds (<span class="accented">rucheen</span>) were under the guidance of angels. Hitzig denies that the winds can be <span class="accented">angelicae potestates</span>, as Jerome maintains; and, when Jerome supports his position by a quotation from the Septuagint Version of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, gives as answer a mark of exclamation. The passage, "He set the nations according to the number of the angels of God," represents a phase of thought in regard to angelology, which Daniel elsewhere obviously has. The double meaning of the word <span class="accented">ruach</span> made the transition easy. We see the same double meaning in <a href="/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>. The sea, then, is to be regarded as the great mass of Gentile nations, and the winds are, therefore, the spiritual agencies by which God carries on the history of the world. As there are four winds, there are also four empires. There are angelic princes of at least two of these empires referred to later. May we not argue that these empires had, according to the thought of Daniel, each an angelic head? It may be doubted whether the most advanced critics know more of angelology than Daniel, or can be certain that his view was a mistaken one. Moreover, the Mediterranean Sea was the centre round which the epic of history, as revealed to Daniel, unfolded itself. Nebuchadnezzar marched along the eastern shores of that midland sea; the Persian monarchs essayed to command it by their fleets; across a branch of that sea came Alexander; and from yet further across its blue waters came the Romans. The Mediterranean saw most of the history transacted that took place between the time of Daniel and that of our Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1841.htm">Strong's 1841: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', an Israelite leader in Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declared:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;In my vision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7717;ez&#183;w&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
