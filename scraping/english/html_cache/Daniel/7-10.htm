Fire often represents God's holiness and His ability to purify and judge (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). The river flowing from God's presence suggests an unstoppable force of divine will and justice. In the context of Daniel's vision, it emphasizes the power and majesty of God as the ultimate judge. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14-15</a>, where Christ is described with eyes like a flame of fire, symbolizing His penetrating judgment.<p><b>Thousands upon thousands attended Him,</b><br>This phrase highlights the vast number of angelic beings serving God, emphasizing His supreme authority and the grandeur of His heavenly court. The presence of countless angels attending God is a common biblical theme, illustrating His majesty and the organized structure of the heavenly realm (<a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). This scene reflects the heavenly worship and service that continually surrounds God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>, where angels are described as numbering "thousands upon thousands."<p><b>and myriads upon myriads stood before Him.</b><br>The term "myriads" indicates an innumerable multitude, further emphasizing the vastness of those present before God. This multitude likely includes both angels and the redeemed, standing in awe and reverence before the divine throne. The imagery parallels <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a great multitude from every nation stands before the Lamb, signifying the universal scope of God's kingdom and the inclusivity of His salvation.<p><b>The court was convened,</b><br>This phrase introduces a formal judicial setting, where God presides as the ultimate judge. The convening of the court signifies the beginning of divine judgment, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/96-13.htm">Psalm 96:13</a>, <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>). This scene underscores the accountability of all creation to God's righteous standards and the certainty of His justice being executed. The concept of a divine court is also seen in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, where the "sons of God" present themselves before the Lord.<p><b>and the books were opened.</b><br>The opening of the books symbolizes the revelation of truth and the examination of deeds. In biblical literature, books often represent records of human actions and God's decrees (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). This imagery conveys the idea that nothing is hidden from God's sight and that all will be judged according to their works. The opening of the books signifies the transparency and thoroughness of divine judgment, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with God's perfect knowledge and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ancient_of_days.htm">The Ancient of Days</a></b><br>This is a title for God, emphasizing His eternal nature and sovereign authority.
