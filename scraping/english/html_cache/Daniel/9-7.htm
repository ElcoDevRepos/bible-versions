God's righteousness is His moral perfection and justice, which is consistently affirmed in scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/11-7.htm">Psalm 11:7</a> and <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>. It sets the standard against which human actions are measured and highlights the divine nature of God as the ultimate judge.<p><b>but this day we are covered with shame</b><br>The shame mentioned here is a result of sin and disobedience. In the context of Daniel, this refers to the Israelites' failure to uphold the covenant with God, leading to their exile. Shame is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with sin and separation from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7-10</a> after the fall of Adam and Eve.<p><b>the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and all Israel near and far</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entire nation of Israel, both the southern kingdom of Judah and the northern kingdom of Israel. It reflects the unity of the people in their shared guilt and consequences of sin. Historically, the division of the kingdoms occurred after Solomon's reign, but in exile, their shared identity as God's people is emphasized.<p><b>in all the countries to which You have driven us</b><br>This refers to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The exile was a direct consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness, as prophesied in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The dispersion of the Israelites among various nations fulfilled God's warnings and served as a period of reflection and repentance.<p><b>because of our unfaithfulness to You</b><br>Unfaithfulness here denotes the breaking of the covenant relationship with God through idolatry and disobedience. This theme is prevalent in the prophetic books, where prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel call the people to repentance. The unfaithfulness of Israel is contrasted with God's faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>, highlighting the need for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, who is interceding for his people, Israel, acknowledging their sin and God's righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The righteous God to whom Daniel is praying, acknowledging His justice and holiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, representing the people of God who have been unfaithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_israel.htm">All Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the entire nation, both the northern and southern kingdoms, emphasizing the collective sin and shame.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exile.htm">The Exile</a></b><br>The event of the Babylonian captivity, a consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness, where they were banished to foreign lands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteousness.htm">God's Righteousness</a></b><br>Recognize that righteousness belongs to God alone.

In the midst of his sorrow for the past, the mind of the prophet recurs unconsciously to the great promise of future deliverance by "the root of Jesse."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them. because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The versions are all very close to the Massoretic text. The most important variation is Theodotion's repetition of the first clause of ver. 7 at the beginning of ver. 8. Neither of the English versions brings out the contrast in the Hebrew of the second clause of ver. 7; it is "man," not "men," of Judah. This contrast is observed by Theodotion and Jerome, but not by the LXX. or the Peshitta. These two verses have a strong resemblance to Bar. 1:15, 16, "And ye shall say, To our God <span class="accented">belongeth</span> righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as <span class="accented">it is come to pass</span> this day to man of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers." This confession is introduced into the text of Baruch as a quotation. The captives on the river Lud send money to Jerusalem for offerings and sacrifices, and with the money send certain advices. As the circumstances in which the Baruch version purports to be written do not so naturally suit the words used, we can, we think, have no difficulty in recognizing that it is not the primitive recension. The words have the look of a liturgic prayer. The relationship between the present passage and Jeremiah is close; "confusion of face" occurs in <a href="/jeremiah/7-19.htm">Jeremiah 7:19</a> as well as <a href="/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>. The most marked case is the collocation, "man of Judah, and <span class="accented">inbabitants</span> of Jerusalem." This phrase is frequent in Jeremiah; <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>. There is also a resemblance to Ezekiel in the phrase, "their trespass that they have trespassed against thee;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/ezekiel/15-8.htm">Ezekiel 15:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>. The language thus is in strict dramatic suitability to one who has just been studying the prophets of the Captivity. <span class="accented">To our kings</span>, <span class="accented">to oar princes.</span> This could not be used naturally after the date of Daniel. To him who remembered kings and princes in Judah and Jerusalem, this language is natural. In the age of Epiphanes it would be absurd and meaningless. The phrase is used in the liturgic prayer in Nehemiah, because there is a narrative of the history of the people. When we compare the Psalter of Solomon, we find the only King of Israel is God: yet Alexander Jannseus, who was not long dead when that Psalter was written, had assumed the crown; and his sons had competed for the possession of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To You,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1444;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
