The "strength of his whole kingdom" suggests a full mobilization of resources and military might, reflecting the historical context of Hellenistic power struggles following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. This aligns with the historical actions of Antiochus III, who sought to expand his influence over the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.<p><b>and will reach an agreement with the king of the South</b><br>The "king of the South" is typically identified as the ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. The agreement mentioned here is a political alliance, often sealed through marriage, a common practice in ancient diplomacy to secure peace or strengthen ties between rival powers. This reflects the historical peace treaty between Antiochus III and Ptolemy V, which included a marriage alliance.<p><b>He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom</b><br>This refers to the historical event where Antiochus III gave his daughter, Cleopatra I, in marriage to Ptolemy V. The intention behind this marriage was to gain influence over Egypt and eventually control it. This tactic of using marriage to achieve political ends is well-documented in ancient history and reflects the cunning strategies employed by rulers to expand their power.<p><b>but his plan will not succeed or help him</b><br>Despite the strategic marriage, Antiochus III's plan to control Egypt through his daughter did not succeed. Cleopatra I remained loyal to her husband and the Ptolemaic Kingdom rather than siding with her father. This outcome highlights the limitations of political alliances based on marriage and the unpredictable nature of human loyalty. It also serves as a reminder of the sovereignty of God over human affairs, as seen throughout the book of Daniel, where human plans often fail in the face of divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the Seleucid Empire, historically identified as Antiochus III, who sought to expand his influence and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_south.htm">The King of the South</a></b><br>This is typically understood as the ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt, with whom Antiochus III sought to make an alliance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter.htm">The Daughter</a></b><br>Historically, this is believed to be Cleopatra I, the daughter of Antiochus III, who was given in marriage to Ptolemy V of Egypt as part of a political strategy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_alliance.htm">Marriage Alliance</a></b><br>A common political strategy in ancient times, where marriages were used to secure alliances and peace between rival kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/failed_strategy.htm">Failed Strategy</a></b><br>Despite the marriage alliance, the plan to destroy or control the kingdom through this union did not succeed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limits_of_human_schemes.htm">The Limits of Human Schemes</a></b><br>Human plans, no matter how well-crafted, are ultimately subject to God's sovereign will.

It seems to mean that the consequence of this marriage was the destruction of the woman mentioned. Or it is possible that "her" refers to the southern kingdom. St. Jerome explains it, "<span class= "ital">ut evertat Ptolem?um sive regnum ejus."</span> This has been supposed to point to the marriage of Ptolemy Epiphanes with Cleopatra, the daughter of Antiochus the Great. However, the language is very general. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/11-6.htm" title="And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.">Daniel 11:6</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But she shall not stand.--</span>These words form an explanatory clause, meaning that the plan will not answer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him: thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</span> The LXX. renders, "And he shall set (give, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) his face to enter upon (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his work with violence, and he shall make covenants with him, and shall give him a daughter of man to corrupt her, but she shall not obey, neither shall it be."

Theodotion is like the Massoretic, "And he shall set (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) his face to enter with the strength of all his kingdom, and he shall make all things straight with him, and shall give him a daughter of the women to corrupt her, but she shall not continue on his side, neither be for him." The Peshitta renders, "And he shall set his face to enter with the force of all his kingdom, and all his people shall pass over, and the daughter of men shall be given to him to corrupt her, but she shall not stand, neither be for him." The Vulgate rendering is independent of the other versions, "And he shall set his face that he may come to lay hold of his whole kingdom, and he shall do right things with him, and he shall give to him the daughter of women that he may overturn it, but she shall not stand, neither be for him." The events portrayed here are well known. Antiochus collected all his forces with a view to the conquest of Egypt, then, alarmed by the progress of Rome and the overthrow of Philip of Macedon, he changed his plan. He now endeavoured to get Ptolemy to be his ally, and gave him his daughter Cleopatra to wife, with Coele-Syria as a dowry. His idea was that she would remain always on his side, would be his spy in the court of her husband, and would always lead the policy of Egypt in the lines he wished. His hopes were frustrated. She was not corrupted so as to be false to her husband.
