In the vision, these beasts represent kingdoms that have risen and fallen throughout history. The beasts are symbolic of the empires of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. Each beast has distinct characteristics that align with the nature and influence of these historical empires.<p><b>their dominion was removed</b><br>This indicates that the power and authority of these empires were taken away. Historically, each of these empires experienced a decline and eventual fall, often due to internal corruption, external conquest, or divine intervention. This aligns with the biblical theme that God is sovereign over the rise and fall of nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God "removes kings and sets up kings."<p><b>but they were granted an extension of life</b><br>Despite losing their dominion, these empires continued to exist in some form. This can be understood as the cultural and political influences of these empires persisting even after their political power had waned. For example, the Greek culture continued to influence the Roman Empire and beyond, and elements of these ancient civilizations are still evident in modern societies.<p><b>for a season and a time</b><br>This phrase suggests a divinely appointed period during which these empires would continue to exist in a diminished capacity. The specific duration is not detailed, but it implies a limited and predetermined time frame. This reflects the biblical concept of God's control over history and time, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which states that there is "a time for every matter under heaven." The phrase also connects to prophetic literature, where time periods are often symbolic and point to God's ultimate plan for redemption and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and the author of the Book of Daniel, who receives visions and dreams from God concerning future events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beasts.htm">The Beasts</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of kingdoms or empires that have dominion over the earth.

He now learns what had befallen them. Their dominions had passed away, and their lives had been prolonged up to that definite point and time which had seemed fit to God, and no further. The period of life allotted to them by God was only a little while. (On "times" and "seasons," see Note on <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm" title="And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:">Daniel 2:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time</span>. The version of the LXX. has a different reference, "And those about him he took away from their dominion, and time of life was given them for a time and a season." Here, as in the seventh verse, <span class="cmt_word"></span> we have <span class="accented">shear.</span> The reference then would be to the horns that still remained after the one blaspheming horn was destroyed. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic. The Peshitta differs, but only slightly. As the Massoretic text stands, there is difficulty in maintaining that the reference here cannot be to any other than to the other three beasts. They should still occupy a place, but possess no dominion, even after they were removed from supreme authority. After Babylon lost imperial power, it still continued for a time a highly important province in the Persian Empire, and the sensibilities of the inhabitants were considered throughout the whole period of the Persian rule. After the Persian Empire was overturned by Alexander, there was still the province of Persis; and from the remains of the Persian Empire sprang up Parthia, and then the second Persian Empire; and after the rule of the caliphs had been broken, Persia revived as a Mohammedan power. When the Greek Empire fell, Greece still survived, not independent, but still influential. It is difficult to see what meaning this verse could have to one living at the time of the Maccabees, especially it' he thought the Greek Empire was the fourth. Parthia certainly might represent Persia, but where was Media? "For a season and a time" does not refer to any definite time. Jephet-ibn-Ali regards the reference till the end of the rule of the fourth beast. This militates against the idea that '<span class="accented">iddan</span> must always mean "a year." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
