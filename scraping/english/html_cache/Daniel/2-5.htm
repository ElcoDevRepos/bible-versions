Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, relied on these advisors for guidance. This reflects the cultural and religious practices of Babylon, where astrology played a significant role. The king's reliance on astrologers highlights the tension between human wisdom and divine revelation, a theme prevalent in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>My word is final</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's declaration underscores his absolute authority as a monarch. In the Babylonian empire, the king's word was law, reflecting the autocratic nature of his rule. This phrase sets the stage for the dramatic tension in the narrative, as it contrasts with the ultimate sovereignty of God, who reveals mysteries beyond human understanding.<p><b>If you do not tell me the dream and its interpretation</b><br>The demand for both the dream and its interpretation is unusual and highlights the king's suspicion and desire for genuine insight. This request sets a divine stage for Daniel's God-given ability to reveal mysteries, contrasting the limitations of human wisdom. It also foreshadows the revelation of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms, a central theme in Daniel.<p><b>you will be cut into pieces</b><br>This severe punishment reflects the harshness of ancient Near Eastern justice systems. Such drastic measures were not uncommon in Babylonian law, where disobedience to the king could result in brutal consequences. This threat emphasizes the seriousness of the king's demand and the peril faced by the astrologers, setting the stage for God's intervention through Daniel.<p><b>and your houses will be reduced to rubble</b><br>Destroying one's home was a symbolic act of total annihilation and disgrace. In ancient cultures, a person's house represented their legacy and security. This threat underscores the king's power to obliterate not just individuals but their entire lineage and memory. It also serves as a backdrop for the miraculous deliverance that God provides, showcasing His power to protect and preserve His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had a troubling dream that he demanded to be interpreted without revealing its content.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A group of wise men, astrologers, and magicians in Babylon who were expected to interpret the king's dream.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew captive in Babylon known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams, who later becomes involved in interpreting the king's dream.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and power during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A mysterious dream experienced by Nebuchadnezzar, which he insists must be interpreted without him disclosing its details.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God is in control and reveals mysteries according to His will.

It is as follows "And the king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if therefore ye do not tell me the dream truly and show me the interpretation thereof, ye shall be made an example of, and your goods shall be escheat to the royal treasury." Theodotion renders the last portion of the verse, "ye shall be destroyed (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), and your houses shall be plundered (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, but, like Theodotion, softens the last clause into "plundered." The Vulgate retains the fierceness of the <span class="accented">Massoretic</span>, softened merely in phrase, not in meaning. <span class="accented">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans</span>, <span class="accented">The thing is gone from me.</span> The first thing to be noticed is the difference of the Q'ri and the K'thib in the word "Chaldean;" it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, according to the Syriac usage, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> according to the Chaldee. As the Book of Daniel was copied and recopied many times, probably at least scores of' times before, on the latest assignable critic d date of Daniel, the Massoretic text was fixed, and copied mainly by those whose language was Western not Eastern Aramaic. the occurrence of Syriac forms is more likely to be survivals from a Syriac original than insertions, either accidental or intentional. When the differences are so slight as those between Eastern and Western Aramaic, the tendency is to remove them rather than to accentuate them. The older interpretation of <span class="accented">mill tha</span>, "<span class="accented">thing"</span> or "<span class="accented">word</span>," was to take it as referring to the dream - that it was the matter that had gone from him. This, however, depends to a large degree on the moaning to be attached to <span class="accented">ozda.</span> Is it to be regarded as equivalent to <span class="accented">azla</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> if it were derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "to go;" or is <span class="accented">azda</span> to be regarded as Persian <span class="accented">azdu</span>, "sure," "diligent"? Delitzsch suggests <span class="accented">azanda.</span> "known." The two Greek versions render, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, a phrase which may either be "the word has gone from me," or "the matter has departed from me," the latter being the more natural, from the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The Peshitta rendering is, "Sure is the word I have spoken." The older commentators have mainly taken this sentence as asserting that Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten the dream; Calvin. however, does so only because he feels himself compelled to take ver. 8 as meaning this; while Jephet-ibn-Ali and others assume this to be the meaning of the phrase. Aben Ezra takes <span class="accented">azda</span> as meaning "firm" or sure. Berthohlt, among moderns, maintains that <span class="accented">millitha is</span> "the dream." Most others assert the sentence to mean, "The word which has gone forth from me is sure;" this is also Professor Bevan's interpretation. Hitzig's view here is peculiar: he would translate, "For the matter is important to me." This view does not suit ver. 8. The lexicons differ in this. Winer first gives <span class="accented">elapsus est</span>, <span class="accented">abiit</span>, then adds, "unless rather it be derived from the Arabic (<span class="accented">atzad</span>), 'strong,' or from the Rabbinic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">robustus."</span> Buxtorf does give the alleged Rabbinic use of the verb, but gives reference only to occurrence in the passage before us and ver. 8, and renders <span class="accented">abire.</span> Gesenius renders, "to depart," and quotes in support of this the Rabbinic formula, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d8;&#x5e6;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "to go to one's own opinion," spoken of a rabbi who holds a view not shared by any other. At the same time, Gesenius gives a meaning to the clause as a whole which accords with that of most commentators, "The word has gone out from me." Furst takes the word as meaning "firm," "sure," "unalterable." He too quotes the Rabbinic formula, as if it confirmed his view, which really it does not. Castell gives as <span class="accented">robur</span>, but appends no reference. Brockelmann does not give it at all, nor does Levy. Had Castell given any reference, it might have been argued to be a survival of a Syriac word through transcription; but we must remain in doubt in this, all the more so that the Peshitta does not transfer the word, which it would naturally have done had the word been extant in Syriac in A.D. . This would make it probable that it is an old word. The fact that it is used in Talmudic only in a formula, and then in a sense unsuitable to the present passage, confirms the idea of its age. It had probably a technical meaning, denoting that a certain matter was irrevocable. The Persian derivation of the word is by no means certain, though supported by Schrader and Noehleke. It may have a Shemitic root. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">azoz</span>) Assyrian (Schrader, 526), "to be <span class="accented">firm</span>," may be the <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> form of the word, which becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;</span> in Syriac, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> in <span class="accented">status emphatieus.</span> In Aramaic <span class="aramaic">&#x5d6;</span> of Hebrew becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">zabab</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">dehab</span>), "gold." The Assyrian use of sibilants is more akin to Hebrew than to Aramaic. <span class="accented">Sa</span>, "this," is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zeh</span>), Schrader, 'Keiln.,' 586. If <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d6;</span> were transferred from <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> and put in the <span class="accented">status emphaticus</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is not an unlikely form for it to assume. Even grant the word to be Persian, it is far from proving, or even rendering it probable, that Daniel was composed in the days of the Maccabees. There is no trace of Persian producing much effect on the language of the numerous peoples that were subject to the Persian empire. There is no sign that the word was known in Palestine during the time when the Targums were becoming fixed. In Alexandria, where the Septuagint version of Daniel was made, the meaning of the word was not known, and was thought to be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>). In Asia Minor, where Theodotion made his version, it was unknown. Jerome, who made his version, if not in Palestine, yet under Pales-tinian guidance, translates it also as equivalent to <span class="accented">azal.</span> The natural conclusion is that this book must have been composed not later than the Persian period, and not far from the centre of government. As we have already said, our interpretation agrees with that of Professor Bevan; we would render the phrase, "<span class="accented">The</span> word which has gone forth from me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "is fixed." The reason of the king's refusal to tell the wise men his dream is that he cannot do it, net because he has forgotten it, but because he has already announced that he wishes these soothsayers to prove their ability to give the interpretation of the dream by telling him what the dream was which he had had. He has committed himself to that course; he is a king, and he may not change, <span class="accented">If ye will not make known to me the dream</span>, <span class="accented">with the interpretation thereof</span>, <span class="accented">ye shall be cut in pieces</span>, <span class="accented">and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> The king, unaccustomed to be opposed or refused anything, at once determines that it is not inability to tell him what he wishes to know that hinders the soothsayers, but unwillingness. Of course, the abruptness of the action, immediate sentence pronounced on their hesitating to satisfy his demand, seems improbable. We must, however, remember that we have the account given us in the utmost brevity. We have the substance of the dialogue between the king and his astrologers. It is put in dialogue form simply because the Shemitic tongues naturally lend themselves to this mode of presentation. The sentence, "ye shall be cut in pieces," suggests some of the punishments inflicted by Asshurbanipal on those who rebelled against him. In the Aramaic the meaning literally is, "Ye shall be made pieces of." This is considerably softened in both the Greek versions. In the LXX. the rendering <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye shall be made an example of." Theodotion renders, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye shall be for destruction." The Peshitta is stronger, if anything, from the succession of words, "Piece piece ye shall be cut." The punishment certainly was horrible, but not more so than the punishment David inflicted on the murderers of Ishbosheth. Indeed, in European countries a century and a half ago punishments yet more revolting were frequent. The punishment for treason in our own country was as horrible as anything well could be. The sentence, however, went further than merely the individuals. <span class="accented">And your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> In the 'Records of the Past,' 1:27, 43, are references to something like this. "houses reduced to heaps of rubbish." That the houses thus made heaps of rubbish should therefore be made dunghills, is in perfect accordance with the manners at present holding in the East. The rendering of the Septuagint is very peculiar here, "<span class="accented">And</span> your goods shall be escheat to tire royal treasury (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." This cannot be due to any desire to soften the meaning, for in the first place, in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>:29, where the same phrase occurs in the Aramaic, it is paraphrased, but not really changed; it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But further, the meaning here is perfectly different from that in the Aramaic of the Masse,retie recension. Theodotion's rendering is a softening of the Massoretic, "Your houses shall be (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) torn down;" but the Septuagint quite changes the meaning. If the translator had a slightly blurred copy before him, he might read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span>; that is to say, instead of "a dunghill," he read it as the third person plural pael of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>), "<span class="accented">to go."</span> When written in Sama-titan characters, or in old Phoenican characters, the last word would not be unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5da;</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> the king." This is the only explanation of this variation that seems feasible, and it implies that the manuscript before the Septuagint translator was written in Eastern, not Western Aramaic. The pre-formative <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, used as the sign of the third person, is the peculiarity of Eastern Aramaic. The translator must have bad this generally before him in his manuscript, or he never could have made this mistake. This is another indication that the Aramaic of Daniel was originally not Chaldee, but Syriac. We can imagine the striking scene: on the one wide the haughty young conqueror, blazing in indignation at the obstinate refusal, as he counts it, of his soothsayers and augurs to tell him his dream and the meaning of it; on the other, the crouching crowd of magicians, astrologers, and oneiromantists, dispirited and nonplussed. Brought up in an absolute faith in astrology and augury, the king never doubted their ability to tell him his dream; it could only be a treasonable desire to hinder him from taking the suitable steps to avoid whatever danger might be threatened by it, or to gain whatever advantage might be promised. They would not tell him the dream, because by their rules the interpretation would be fixed, and from that they could I not escape. The king will not and cannot reverse his word, and they cannot tell him what he desires, and so they stand facing each other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the astrologers,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;a&#347;&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
