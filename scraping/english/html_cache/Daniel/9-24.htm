This period is decreed specifically for the Jewish people and Jerusalem, indicating a divine timeline for significant events in Israel's history. The concept of "weeks" as years is supported by other biblical passages, such as <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27-28</a>, where a "week" refers to a seven-year period. This prophecy is given during the Babylonian exile, a time when the Jewish people were longing for restoration and return to their homeland.<p><b>to stop their transgression</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine intervention to halt the rebellion and disobedience of the Jewish people. The transgression refers to the collective sins that led to their exile, including idolatry and failure to uphold the covenant with God. The prophecy suggests a future time when these transgressions will be addressed and rectified, aligning with the themes of repentance and restoration found throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>to put an end to sin</b><br>The prophecy foretells a time when sin will be decisively dealt with. This can be seen as a reference to the coming of the Messiah, who, according to Christian belief, provides the ultimate solution to sin through His sacrificial death and resurrection. The end of sin is a theme echoed in the New Testament, particularly in passages like <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>, which speaks of Christ appearing to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.<p><b>to make atonement for iniquity</b><br>Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, achieved through a sacrificial offering. In the Old Testament, this was symbolized by the Day of Atonement rituals. The prophecy points to a future, ultimate atonement, which Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose death is seen as the final and complete atonement for humanity's sins, as described in <a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.<p><b>to bring in everlasting righteousness</b><br>This phrase suggests the establishment of a new order characterized by perpetual righteousness. It implies a transformation that goes beyond temporary or partial measures, pointing to the Messianic age when God's kingdom will be fully realized. This is consistent with prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4-5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>, which speak of a righteous reign.<p><b>to seal up vision and prophecy</b><br>Sealing up vision and prophecy indicates the fulfillment and completion of prophetic revelations. It suggests that the events described will bring to fruition the promises and predictions given through the prophets. This completion is seen in the New Testament as being realized in Christ, who fulfills the Law and the Prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>and to anoint the Most Holy Place</b><br>The anointing of the Most Holy Place refers to the consecration and sanctification of a sacred space. In the context of the prophecy, it could refer to the future temple or the ultimate sanctification brought about by the Messiah. In Christian theology, this is often interpreted as the anointing of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest and the establishment of a new covenant, as described in <a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian exile, known for his faithfulness and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/y/your_people.htm">Your People</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who are in exile during Daniel's time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_city.htm">Holy City</a></b><br>Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship and the location of the temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventy_weeks.htm">Seventy Weeks</a></b><br>A prophetic period symbolizing a divinely appointed time for the fulfillment of God's purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/most_holy_place.htm">Most Holy Place</a></b><br>The innermost part of the temple, symbolizing God's presence and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_timelines.htm">Understanding Prophetic Timelines</a></b><br>The "seventy weeks" symbolize God's perfect timing in fulfilling His promises.

Possibly, also, the language (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm" title="In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.">Daniel 10:2</a>, margin "weeks of days") implies that "weeks of days" are not intended here. On the other hand, it is remarkable that in <a href="/context/leviticus/25-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying,">Leviticus 25:1-10</a> the word week should not have been used to signify a period of seven years, if year-weeks are implied in this passage. However, it is generally assumed that we must understand the weeks to consist of years and not of days (see Pusey's <span class= "ital">Daniel,</span> pp. 165, 166), the principle of year-weeks depending upon <a href="/numbers/14-34.htm" title="After the number of the days in which you searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall you bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my breach of promise.">Numbers 14:34</a>, <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm" title="Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.">Leviticus 26:34</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/4-6.htm" title="And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.">Ezekiel 4:6</a>. The word "week" in itself furnishes a clue to the meaning. It implies a "Heptad," and is not necessarily more definite than the "time" mentioned in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.</span> The LXX. here differs from the above, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and the city Zion, to make an end of sin, to make unrighteousnesses rare (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and to wipe out the unrighteous-nesses, and to understand the vision, and to give (appoint) (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) everlasting righteousness, and to end the visions and the prophet, and to rejoice the holy of holies."

Neither of these seems to be the original of the Greek. Schleusner suggests to read <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis renders <span class="accented">lemaz'or</span>, "to bring to nothing" (<a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>, Peshitta). How Wolf ('Siebzigwochen,' p. 26) can say the LXX. confirms the Massoretic K'thib, is difficult to see. The author of the first rendering of this phrase seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>-<span class="accented">thath</span>) instead of <span class="accented">hatham</span>; the other translator must have read <span class="accented">mahah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to understand the vision," seems a doublet of the clause, "to seal up the vision." There seems to have been in one of the manuscripts used by the LXX. translator a transposition of words; for one of them must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehoothan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, since he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This is an impossible change, but the mistaking of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> is perfectly easy to imagine, if <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> had been written in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, and it transferred to the place in the Massoretic text occupied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, then we can easily understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. In the last clause the LXX. translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, a clearly inferior reading. The impression conveyed to one is that the translators were able to put no intelligible meaning on the passage, and rendered the words successively as nearly as they could without attempting to make them sense. We must admit, however, that the phenomena that cause this impression may be due to corruption of the text. Theodotion renders, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and on the holy city, to seal sins and wipe away unrighteousness, and to atone for sin, and to bring the everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies." Theodotion, it will be seen, as the LXX., has "prophet" instead of "prophecy," which certainly is more verbally accurate than our version; he omits "to finish transgression," having instead, "to seal sins." The Peshitta has followed the K'thib and renders, "finish transgressions," and instead of "prophecy" has the "prophets." The text of the Vetus, as preserved to us by Tertullian, is, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">breviatae</span>) upon thy people, and upon the holy city, until sin shall grow old, and iniquities be marked (<span class="accented">signentur</span>), and righteousnesses rise up, and eternal righteousness be brought in, and that the vision and the prophet should be marked (<span class="accented">signetur</span>), and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>) be anointed." Jerome renders, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">abbreviate sunt</span>)<span class="accented">upon</span> thy people and upon thy holy city, to end falsehood (<span class="accented">prevarieatio</span>), to end sin, to wipe out iniquity, to bring in the everlasting righteousness, to fulfil the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>)." The Hebrew here is peculiar; the word for "weeks" is in the masculine, which is unexampled elsewhere in the plural. The singular masculine is found, <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>; there is no case of feminine singular. Mr. Galloway ('Shadow on the Sundial,' p. 51) would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and would render, "by weeks it is determined." There seems little evidence for this reading; against a few late manuscripts is the consensus of versions. "Determined" is also a word that occurs only Lore; it is Aramaic, but not common even in that language. It means "to cut off." It may thus refer to these weeks being "cut off" from time generally; hence "determined." It is singular, and its nominative is plural. "To finish" also causes difficulty; so translated, it implies that the word should be written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; but it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which means "to restrain," "to enclose," "to separate off" (Furst). Hence if we translate as it stands, it should be "restrain transgression." "To make an end of" in also "cause transgression to cease" This in a rendering of the Massoretic Q'ri; if the K'thib had been taken, the translation should rather have been "to seal." "Sins:" this word is plural in the K'thib, but singular in the Q'ri. A large number of manuscripts write the word plural; the Greek versions give the plural; the Pe-shista and Vulgate, Aquila and Paulus Tellensis, singular. "The prophecy," it is clearly an it stands "the prophet." Jerome is the only one of the versions that takes the word in the sense in which it is taken in our versions. Professor Bevan renders it "prophet" (so Hitzig and Hengstenberg). One is tempted to adopt the reading of Michaelis <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "the vision of the prophet," which has some manuscript authority (Wolf, 'Siebzigwochen,' p. 15). The overwhelming mass of evidence is in favour of the present consonantal text. <span class="accented">Seventy weeks.</span> "Week," while generally a week of days (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>), was occasionally week of years, as <a href="/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>, "fulfil the week of this," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the seven years of service. Among the later Jews this became a recognized mode of reckoning, as in the Book of Jubilees, each jubilee in divided into successive weeks. From what follows it is necessary that the weeks here are sevens of years. "Are determined," as already indicated, means "cut off," not "shortened," which does not seem to be the meaning of the word in any case. "Upon thy people and upon thy holy city." Daniel has been praying long and earnestly for his people; so there would be no inability to see what was meant by "his city and his people." "To finish transgression" is equivalent to "to restrain transgression." Transgression is apt to become bold and imperious; it is a great deal when it is even somewhat "restrained." It is to be noted that, as Daniel's prayer was greatly confession of the sins of the people and prayer for forgiveness, the promises here are largely moral; but still the Messianic period even was not to be expected to be one in which there will be no sin - it is to be restrained. "To make an end of sins" - though "to seal sins" seems the better reading diplomatically it is the K'thib, and that of some of the versions. It is difficult to give the phrase an intelligible meaning. Moreover, the occurrence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> so immediately after is against it. Something may be said for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, which occurs in a similar connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span> that this does in <a href="/lamentations/4-22.htm">Lamentations 4:22</a>. This is the reading of one of the translators in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - the spirit of lawlessness would be restrained and the past iniquities and their guilt wiped away. "To make reconciliation " - "to make an atonement." The verb used is the technical word, "the offering of an atoning sacrifice." In this sense it occurs some fifty times in Leviticus. This might apply to the renewal of sacrificial offerings in the temple after the fifty years' cessation during the Babylonian captivity, or to the renewal after the shorter cessation under the oppression inflicted on the Jews under Epiphanes. The next clause implies a wider application and a loftier sacrifice. Professor Bevan is right in maintaining that, despite the accents, this clause is to be connected with the next. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">bring in everlasting righteousness.</span> This is more than merely the termination of the suit of God against his people (<a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>). The phrase occurs in <a href="/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>, and is applied to the righteousness of God. These two, "atonement for sin" and "the everlasting righteousness," are found in Christ - his atoning death and the righteousness which he brings into the world. It is true that when Daniel heard these words spoken by Gabriel he might not put any very distinct meaning on them - in that he was but like other prophets; the prophets did not know the meaning of their own prophecies. <span class="accented">To seal up the vision and prophecy</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">to seal vision and prophet - to</span> set to them the seal of fulfilment (von Lengerke, Hitzig, Bevan). This does not refer to Jeremiah, because his prophecy referred merely to the return from Babylon, and this refers to a period which is to continue long after that. Jeremiah's prophecy was about to be verified. This new prophecy required four hundred and ninety years ere it received its verification. Some event to happen nearly half a millennium after Daniel is to prove the prophecy God has given him to be true. <span class="accented">And to anoint the Most Holy.</span> This phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh qodasheem</span>), is used some forty times in Scripture, but almost always of things, as the altar and the innermost sanctuary (Bevan, 155). Hengstenberg ('Christ.,' 3:119) points out that the phrase for "sanctuary" is "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;</span>, with the article. He appeals to <a href="/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a> as a case where, without the article, the phrase applies to an individual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayibba-dayl Aheron leheqdeesho qodesh qadasheem</span>), "And he separated Aaron to sanctify him as a holy of holies." This seems almost the necessary translation, despite the versions; for the prenominal suffix must be the object, and "holy of holies" must be in apposition to it. The act of anointing as a sign of consecration, though applied to the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9</a>), to the altar (<a href="/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a>), the laver (<a href="/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>), is never applied to the holy of holies. It is applied most frequently to persons; as to Aaron (<a href="/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>), to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), to David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-3.htm">1 Samuel 16:3</a>). The words of Gabriel thus point forward to a time when all iniquity shall be restrained, sin atoned for, and a priest anointed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Seventy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7657.htm">Strong's 7657: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventy (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">weeks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;&#1467;&#1506;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7687;u&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7620.htm">Strong's 7620: </a> </span><span class="str2">A period of seven (days, years), heptad, week</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are decreed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#7717;&#183;ta&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2852.htm">Strong's 2852: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut off, to decree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;
