In the context of Daniel, these are likely the faithful Jews who remain true to God's covenant during times of persecution. The role of instructing many suggests a responsibility to guide others in truth and righteousness, similar to the role of prophets and wise men in Israel's history. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the wise imparting knowledge, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to teach all nations.<p><b>though for a time they will fall by sword or flame</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a period of persecution and suffering for those who are faithful. Historically, this can be linked to the Maccabean period, where Jews faced severe oppression under Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The mention of "sword or flame" symbolizes violent death and martyrdom, reflecting the harsh realities faced by those who stand firm in their faith. This echoes the trials faced by early Christians, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-36.htm">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>, where believers endured torture and death for their faith.<p><b>or be captured or plundered</b><br>This phrase highlights the additional forms of persecution, including imprisonment and loss of property. Such experiences were common for the Jewish people during the Seleucid Empire's reign and later for Christians under Roman rule. The idea of being captured or plundered also resonates with the experiences of the Israelites throughout their history, such as during the Babylonian exile. This serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship, as Jesus warned in <a href="/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17-22</a> about the trials His followers would face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise.htm">The Wise</a></b><br>Refers to those who have understanding and insight, often seen as leaders or teachers who guide others in truth and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/instruct_many.htm">Instruct Many</a></b><br>The act of teaching and guiding others, particularly in spiritual or moral matters.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fall_by_sword_or_flame.htm">Fall by Sword or Flame</a></b><br>Represents persecution and suffering that the wise will endure for their faith and teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/captured_or_plundered.htm">Captured or Plundered</a></b><br>Indicates the trials and tribulations, including imprisonment and loss, faced by the faithful.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_daniel.htm">The Context of Daniel</a></b><br>This chapter is part of a prophetic vision given to Daniel, detailing future conflicts and the role of God's people amidst these events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_wise.htm">The Role of the Wise</a></b><br>The wise are called to instruct and guide others, even in the face of adversity.

The pattern continued when James fell &#8220;by the sword&#8221; under Herod (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>) and when early believers faced Roman fires. <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a> depicts martyrs whose blood has been shed for the testimony of Jesus, showing that physical violence against the righteous is neither accidental nor unnoticed by heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or be captured or plundered</b><p>Not all opposition ends in death; many experience seizure of freedom or property.

The Peshitta renders, "The dispersed of the people shall instruct many, and they shall fall by the sword, and by fire, by captivity, and by spoil, a thousand days."
