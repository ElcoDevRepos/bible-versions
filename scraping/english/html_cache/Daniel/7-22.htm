This imagery is unique to the book of Daniel, appearing in <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9, 13, and 22</a>. The term suggests God's timeless existence and His role as the ultimate judge. In the context of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, this arrival signifies a divine intervention in human history, where God steps in to assert His authority over earthly kingdoms. This concept is echoed in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, where God is described as the Alpha and Omega, underscoring His eternal presence.<p><b>and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High</b><br>The judgment in favor of the saints indicates a divine vindication of God's people. In the biblical narrative, the "saints" refer to those who are faithful to God, often facing persecution and suffering. This judgment is a reversal of fortunes, where the oppressed are justified and their oppressors are condemned. This theme of divine justice is prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, where God is portrayed as the defender and vindicator of His people.<p><b>and the time came for them to possess the kingdom</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of God's people inheriting the kingdom. In the context of Daniel, this is a prophetic vision of the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers. The "kingdom" here is not just a physical realm but represents the full realization of God's rule and reign. This promise is consistent with the New Testament teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, where the meek are promised the inheritance of the earth, and in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our Lord. This possession of the kingdom is a fulfillment of God's covenant promises and a central hope for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_of_days.htm">Ancient of Days</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His eternal nature and sovereign authority.
