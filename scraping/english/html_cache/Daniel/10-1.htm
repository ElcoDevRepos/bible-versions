The third year of his reign would be around 536 BC. Cyrus is noted for his decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>), fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>. This period marks a significant transition for the Jewish people from exile to restoration.<p><b>a message was revealed to Daniel</b><br>Daniel, a Jewish exile in Babylon, is the recipient of divine revelation. Throughout the book, Daniel is portrayed as a prophet and a man of prayer, receiving visions and messages from God. This revelation underscores his role as a mediator of God's word to His people, similar to other prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>who was called Belteshazzar</b><br>Belteshazzar is the Babylonian name given to Daniel, reflecting the practice of renaming captives to assimilate them into Babylonian culture (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>). This name, possibly meaning "Bel protect the king," indicates the influence of Babylonian religion and culture. Despite this, Daniel remains faithful to the God of Israel, maintaining his identity and integrity.<p><b>The message was true</b><br>The truth of the message emphasizes its divine origin and reliability. In biblical terms, truth is often associated with God's character and His word (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>). This assurance of truth would have been crucial for the exiled Jewish community seeking hope and guidance.<p><b>and it concerned a great conflict</b><br>The "great conflict" likely refers to spiritual and earthly battles, including the struggles of God's people against oppressive powers. This theme of conflict is prevalent in apocalyptic literature, such as in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7-12</a> and Revelation, where spiritual warfare and the ultimate victory of God's kingdom are depicted.<p><b>And the understanding of the message was given to him in a vision</b><br>Visions are a common means of divine communication in the Bible, providing insight into God's plans and purposes. Daniel's ability to understand the vision highlights his prophetic gift and God's favor upon him. This understanding is crucial for interpreting the events and encouraging the faithful, similar to how Joseph and other prophets received and interpreted dreams and visions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who was taken into Babylonian captivity as a young man.

The contents of the revelation are specified in the perplexing words, "the thing was true, and the time appointed (comp. <a href="/daniel/8-12.htm" title="And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.">Daniel 8:12</a>) was long," by which is meant apparently that truth and long tribulation were the subject of their vision. "Time appointed" is translated "warfare" (<a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm" title="Speak you comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she has received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.">Isaiah 40:2</a>), and is here used in the same sense, meaning "hardship" or "tribulation."

Here the LXX. has <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>. From the fact that the first person appears in the next verse, there is at least a probability in favour of this reading. Theodotion is, as usual, closer to the Massoretic. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The text before him has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the hophal, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, which is possibly the kal. The Peshitta seems to have used a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes; the same is true of the Vulgate. The Peshitta renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> by <span class="accented">heel</span>, and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">fortitudo</span>. <span class="accented">In the third year of Cyrus.</span> The various reading of the Septuagint is of value. It is not to be dismissed as due to a desire to harmonize this date with that in <a href="/daniel/1-21.htm">Daniel 1:21</a>, for the numeral "third" might easily be an accidental mistake present in some few Palestinian manuscripts due to the beginning of the eighth chapter. The first chapter, as we have seen, has many traces that it is at once an epitome and a compilation. It is evident that the writer in the first chapter would have the rest of the book before him, and would mean to harmonize his statements with that of the chapter before us. It seems difficult to imagine that the compiler of the first chapter could have this statement before him, and yet write as he did. We should therefore be inclined to leave the question doubtful. Even if it should be admitted that the Massoretic date is correct, as we have already seen, the difficulties created are by no means insuperable. Hitzig has made it a difficulty that Daniel did not avail himself of the permission to return to his own country, granted by Cyrus. Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span>, "For those who believe Daniel to be an ideal figure, no explanation is necessary." In that assertion he is mistaken. If Daniel were presented as an ideal Jew, why does he not conform to the ideal of Judaism? The statement that Daniel was a man of nearly ninety years of age at the date of <span class="accented">Cyrus's</span> proclamation is a sufficient answer to this difficulty. Hitzig thinks he rebuts this answer of Havernick's by referring to the old men (<a href="/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>) who remembered the former temple; but these might have been children of ten or twelve when they were carried away captive eighteen years after Daniel, and thus might not be more than sixty when Cyrus's decree came. Further, we know that only a very limited number of Jews returned, and that so many of the best of the Jews remained that it was declared that the chaff came to Jerusalem, but that the finest of the wheat remained in Babylon. <span class="accented">A thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called Belteshazzar.</span> "Thing" is the general term <span class="accented">dabar</span>, which means sometimes "decree," sometimes "word," or sometimes, as rendered by the Authorized, " thing." As Professor Fuller remarks, this is to be taken as the title of the rest of the remaining sections. The recurrence of the Babylonian name "Belteshazzar" may be due to the recency of the overthrow of the Babylonian monarchy. <span class="accented">And the thing was true</span>, <span class="accented">but the time appointed was long.</span> Hitzig thinks that in the first clause the author betrays his standpoint, as he would not know the thing was true till fact had proved it so. But, besides that an editor might have added this clause, a man might well be certain of the truth of a thing he had got from God; he might wish to impress this upon his hearers. The last clause here is certainly mistranslated in the Authorized. <span class="accented">The time appointed was long.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) never means "appointed time," although it is twice translated so in Job, as here; but in all these cases with greater accuracy render "warfare." With this sense is to be compared the use we find in <a href="/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>-43, where the Levites' service in the sanctuary is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>). If we are to keep to the Massoretic reading, then the rendering of the Revised is really the only one to be thought cf. Professor Bevan, following Ewald, thinking that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> means in ch. 8:1:4 "temple service," would apply this meaning here. As we saw, in considering that verse, the word there was of very doubtful authenticity, we need not apply that meaning here, as it would only suit by being twisted into "obligation." Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Zockler, Keil, and others regard this word as meaning "difficulty," "oppression." Something may, however, be said for the Septuagint rendering, all the more that it was adopted by Aquila. According to these renderings, we conjoin these words, great hosts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, with the next, which they understand read as third person singular imperfect kal, or omit the conjunction, "And a great multitude understood the decree." "The host" in this interpretation would here naturally mean "the host of heaven." We find that throughout this chapter, and in the twelfth, we have to do with the angels, so it is natural that in this title and summary of what is to follow the fact that the great host of heaven understood this mystery should be stated. Theodotion's rendering, "power," though supported by Jerome in the Vulgate, need not detain us. The view of Jephet-ibn-Ali is that the host may be of Edom, probably meaning by this Rome. <span class="accented">And he understood the thing</span>, <span class="accented">and had understanding of the vision.</span> This is a fairly correct rendering of the Hebrew. Von Lengerke would make the verbs imperative, which certainly they might be, so far as form goes, but the intrusion of imperatives here into the title of a section seems violent. The main difficulty, moreover, is not touched. As they stand, these two clauses assert the same thing, and if with Yon <span class="accented">Lengerke</span> we make them both imperatives, we have the difficulty still present with us. It may be a case of "<span class="accented">doublet."</span> This is an hypothesis we scarcely would adopt except in necessity, since the Septuagint has both clauses. Theodotion, however, has only one of them. We feel ourselves inclined to follow the reading of the Septuagint. The angels understood the matter, and he - Daniel - understood it also by the vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the third</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
