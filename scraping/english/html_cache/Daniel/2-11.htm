Yet the episode points to the God who specializes in the impossible, who reveals mysteries, and who chooses to dwell with His people. Daniel&#8217;s God is no distant deity; He is the all-knowing, all-powerful Lord who delights to make Himself known and to live among those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) A <span class= "bld">rare thing</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a difficult matter. The difficulty is so great, that the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh are alone able to solve it. Here the reference is to a doctrine of Babylonian theology, according to which every man from his birth onward had a special deity attached to him as his protector. It lived in him, or "dwelt with flesh," as the wise men here remark. The deity, being united to the man, became a partaker of human infirmities. For instance, it was subject to the action of evil spirits, and to the influence of the spirits of sickness to such an extent that it might injure the person whom it was bound to protect. Even these deities, the wise men urge, cannot do what the king requires. Such wisdom belongs only to the gods whose dwelling is apart from man. (See Lenormant, <span class= "ital">La Magie,</span> pp. 181-183.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth</span>. The Septuagint Version of this passage is, "The thing which thou requirest, O king, is hard and strange." The last two winds are most likely a case of doublet - two different renderings of the same Aramaic wind, <span class="accented">yakkirah.</span> The primary meaning of this word is "heavy," and by transference it becomes "difficult," and then, "strange" or "rare." There may have been a slight difference of reading to account for the sentence taking the vocative term it does. It may be due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e8;</span> in the following clause. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. and translates <span class="accented">yakkirah</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta does not differ here from the Massoretic text. The soothsayers still pursue their line of defence, which they had adopted in the preceding verse. The king cannot get the answer he demands - his demand is so difficult and strange. And there is none ether that can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. The Septuagint rendering (lifters somewhat, though slightly, from the Massoretic text: "And there is no one who will show these things to the king, unless some (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) angel, whose dwelling is not at all with flesh." The omission <span class="accented">of ahoran</span>, "other," gives some slight confirmation of the suggestion that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "strange" or "peculiar," represents it. It is very characteristic of the time when the Septuagint translation was made, and of the opinions then current, that the, word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">elohin</span>), "gods," should be rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "angels" By this time there was an avoidance of the use of the Divine name, and anything that suggested it; further, there was an avoidance of the names of heathen deities. The same feeling that makes the historian of the Book of Samuel represent (<a href="/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>) Achish swearing by Jehovah rather than by his own gods, as would certainly be the case, makes the translator here represent the soothsayers referring to "angels." The idea of angels of the nations, which we find later in this book, was generally adopted by the Jews in Egypt (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, LXX.). A question has been raised here as to whether the statement, "whose dwelling is not with flesh," is to be regarded as distinguishing all gods from human beings, or as distinguishing certain of the higher gods from the others. The first view is that of Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Bevan, and others; Professor Fuller and Von Lengerke and others maintain the latter opinion. There is one thing certain - that the soothsayers and interpreters of dreams and auguries believed, or, at all events, pretended they believed, themselves each under the guidance of a special <span class="accented">genius</span> or subordinate god. Such a god had his dwelling with flesh - that is to say, with humanity; but there were in their pantheon higher gods, whose dwelling was not with flesh. In some of the incantations and magical formulas which Lenormant has collected in his 'La Magie,' we find (p. 21) Selek-Moulou-ki coming to Ea his father for information as to the causes of disease, etc. Marduk is the Babylonian name for Selek-Moulou-ki, and Marduk was the great revealer; but by this his dwelling was with flesh. As we see, however, there were gods whose dwelling was not with flesh, who knew secrets hid even from Marduk. This excuse of the wise men is a preparation for Daniel's claim to raveal the secret of the king by the power of a higher God than any that communicated with the Babylonian soothsayers. Hitzig regards this as an artistic device of the author. We regard it as the providential intervention of God himself, that raise heathen soothsayers should shelter themselves under an excuse that forced into clearer light the supremacy of Jehovah.
