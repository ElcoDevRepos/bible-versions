Historically, the east and north could refer to regions like Persia and Media or even further afield, such as the Parthians or Scythians. In the context of Daniel, this could symbolize threats from unexpected quarters, disrupting the king's plans. Biblically, the east often represents a place of origin for invaders (e.g., the Magi in <a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>), while the north is frequently associated with judgment (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>).<p><b>and he will go out with great fury</b><br>The king's reaction is one of intense anger and aggression, indicating a desperate attempt to maintain control. This fury can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual battle between good and evil, where earthly rulers are often depicted as pawns in a larger cosmic struggle. Theologically, this mirrors the wrath of earthly powers against divine purposes, as seen in <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>, where Satan's fury is unleashed because he knows his time is short.<p><b>to destroy many</b><br>The intent to destroy many highlights the destructive nature of the king's campaign. This aligns with the broader theme in Daniel of earthly kingdoms rising and falling, often through violence and conquest. Historically, this could be seen in the actions of rulers like Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who persecuted the Jewish people. Theologically, it reflects the ongoing persecution of God's people throughout history, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>, where Jesus warns of future tribulations.<p><b>and devote them to destruction</b><br>This phrase echoes the concept of "herem" in the Old Testament, where something is devoted to destruction as an offering to God, often in the context of holy war (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>). It implies a total annihilation, not just a military defeat. In a prophetic sense, this could symbolize the ultimate judgment against those who oppose God's kingdom. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the finality of God's justice, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ returns to judge and wage war against the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>This refers to a powerful ruler, often interpreted as a prophetic figure representing future opposition to God's people.

While in Egypt he has bad news brought to him from the north and from the east, which stirs up feelings of revenge. Once again he halts in Palestine, where he comes to an end. That this cannot apply to Antiochus is evident from the following facts--(1) Antiochus was in Persia when the news of the defeat of Lysias reached him; (2) Judaea and Jerusalem cannot in any sense be regarded as either east or north of Persia; (3) Antiochus died in Persia, and not near Jerusalem.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; there. fore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many</span>. The version of the Septuagint is very like this, "A rumour out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him, and he shall come out in great rage to lay waste with the sword, and to slay many." The version of Theodotion is somewhat briefer, "Rumours and disturbances out of the east and from the north shall trouble him, and he shall come in much wrath to destroy many." The Syriac is closer than any other version to the Massoretic text. The Vulgate renders, "A rumour out of the east and north shall trouble him, and he shall come with a great multitude that he may beat down and slay many." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hayma</span>) may mean either "wrath" or "multitude." It is difficult to identify the rumours that recalled Antiochus from his conquests. The account given by Porphyry (quoted by Jerome) of his receiving news that led him to ravage the coasts of Phoenicia and march against Armenia are unsupported by other historians. A phrase in Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:8) seems to throw light on this, "After the Macedonians held the supremacy, King Antiochus, when he was endeavouring to change the superstition of this people, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> the Jews, into the manners of the Greeks, was hindered by a Parthian war." There is, however, no record of such a Parthian war; but such a war may have arisen, and not be recorded, as the histories for the period before us are very incomplete. Should we regard these verses as giving another account of the war between Epiphanes and Ptolemy, the tidings out of the north might mean the arrival of the Roman envoys, headed by Popilius Lsenas. If there were also a threat of a Parthian invasion, we should then have, "tidings put of the east and north." <span class="accented">Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy</span>, <span class="accented">and utterly to make away many.</span> Certainly Antiochus did return furious from the expedition in which he was stayed by the Romans; and certainly also he set himself thereafter to compel the Jews to become Greeks in religion, punishing with death refusal to yield to his demands (1 Macc. 1:24-28; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05. 3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But news</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1467;&#1506;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;mu&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
