In the ancient Near Eastern context, fasting was a common practice during times of distress or when seeking divine intervention. Rich foods, often associated with luxury and celebration, were avoided to focus on spiritual matters. This practice aligns with other biblical examples of fasting, such as in <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-9</a>, where fasting is used to seek God's favor or guidance.<p><b>no meat or wine entered my mouth</b><br>The abstention from meat and wine further emphasizes Daniel's commitment to a period of self-denial and spiritual focus. Meat and wine were staples in royal diets and symbolized abundance and pleasure. By refraining from these, Daniel demonstrates humility and a desire to purify himself before God. This mirrors the Nazarite vow in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-4</a>, where individuals abstain from wine and other products to dedicate themselves to the Lord.<p><b>and I did not anoint myself with oil</b><br>Anointing with oil was a common practice in ancient cultures for personal grooming and as a sign of joy or celebration. By not anointing himself, Daniel is expressing his mourning and distress. This act of self-denial is similar to the mourning practices described in <a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>, where abstaining from oil is a sign of grief. It underscores Daniel's earnestness in seeking God's revelation and intervention.<p><b>until the three weeks were completed</b><br>The specific duration of three weeks indicates a deliberate and sustained period of fasting and prayer. This timeframe is significant as it shows Daniel's perseverance and dedication in seeking understanding from God. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). Daniel's three-week fast sets the stage for the profound vision and message he receives, highlighting the importance of persistence in prayer and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his unwavering faith and commitment to God.

By refraining, he signals seriousness before God, aligning himself with earlier moments of purposeful denial (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>). Such voluntary restraint expresses:<p>&#8226; humility&#8212;acknowledging dependence on God alone (<a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>).<p>&#8226; focus&#8212;clearing away distractions to hear from heaven (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; solidarity&#8212;identifying with a people in need of mercy (<a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no meat or wine entered my mouth</b><p>The fast tightens: even ordinary sustenance like meat or a celebratory drink is set aside. Daniel had once refused royal portions to keep himself undefiled (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-10</a>); now he does so to amplify petition. This illustrates that:<p>&#8226; what we consume can either dull or sharpen spiritual sensitivity (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; abstinence is not about legalism but about wholehearted pursuit of God (<a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; denying legitimate pleasures can become a powerful intercessory tool (<a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I did not anoint myself with oil</b><p>In the ancient Near East, oil was daily grooming&#8212;refreshing the skin and signaling joy (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>). By withholding it, Daniel adopts the posture of mourning (<a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>). His outward appearance matches inward contrition, yet the act remains God-focused, not for show (<a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>). Key lessons:<p>&#8226; genuine repentance engages both body and spirit (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; external signs must spring from sincere heart attitude (<a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the three weeks were completed</b><p>The fast is time-bound and purposeful&#8212;&#8220;three full weeks&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>). Persistence matters; the heavenly messenger later reveals a corresponding 21-day conflict in the unseen realm (<a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12-13</a>). This teaches:<p>&#8226; steadfast prayer often intersects with spiritual warfare (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors determined seeking (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; discipline has a defined season that culminates in divine response (<a href="/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="/acts/10-30.htm">Acts 10:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a> portrays a man intentionally setting aside comfort&#8212;rich food, meat, wine, normal grooming&#8212;for twenty-one days to intensify his communion with God. His fast reflects humility, repentance, and unwavering focus, and it becomes the catalyst for profound heavenly revelation. The verse invites believers to consider purposeful, disciplined seasons of self-denial as a means of seeking clearer direction, deeper intimacy, and effective intercession, trusting that the Lord who responded to Daniel still answers earnest, wholehearted pursuit today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Pleasant bread</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> delicate food.

His ordinary habit was to eat flesh and to drink wine; but during these weeks of fast, he denied himself these dainties. <span class="accented">Neither did I anoint myself at all</span>, <span class="accented">till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> The pleasure of anointing the body with oil was highly esteemed among the ancients. It is impossible to fail to recognize, in this passage, the origin of the Essenian discipline. The Essenes abstained, from flesh, from wine, and from anointing themselves. Daniel thus abstained, as a sign of sorrow for the <span class="accented">sin</span> of his people; they made this fast a perpetual discipline. They waited for the salvation of Israel, and endeavoured, by fasting, to hasten the coming of the Lord. The converse of this, that Daniel's fast is derived from the Essene discipline, is not to be thought cf. It is a sign of a later development, when such practices of self-denial, from being the incidents of a life which occur on special occasions, become its rule. As early as <span class="date">B.C. 106</span> an Essene is mentioned teaching in the temple, and mentioned with no evidence that his sect was a thing of recent origin. The limits are narrow between the critical date of Daniel and this date that within them so prominent a sect as the Essenes should spring up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I ate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1431;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rich</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1467;&#1491;&#1438;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mu&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2530.htm">Strong's 2530: </a> </span><span class="str2">To desire, take pleasure in</span><br /><br /><span class="word">food,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1443;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">meat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
