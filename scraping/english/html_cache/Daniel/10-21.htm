This concept aligns with other biblical references to divine books, such as the "Book of Life" (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). The idea of a heavenly book suggests that God&#8217;s plans are predetermined and unchangeable, emphasizing His omniscience and sovereignty. This phrase indicates that the message Daniel is about to receive is not a new revelation but part of God's eternal plan. The angelic messenger is preparing to reveal events that are already determined, underscoring the reliability and authority of the prophecy.<p><b>Yet no one has the courage to support me against these,</b><br>The "these" likely refers to spiritual forces opposing God's purposes, possibly demonic entities or principalities. This phrase highlights the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in Daniel and other biblical texts, such as <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of struggles against spiritual forces of evil. The mention of courage suggests the intensity and danger of this spiritual conflict. The angelic messenger's struggle indicates that even in the heavenly realms, there is resistance to God's plans, requiring divine intervention and support.<p><b>except Michael your prince.</b><br>Michael is identified as a chief prince and protector of Israel, as seen in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>. His role as a warrior angel is also noted in <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>, where he leads heavenly armies against Satan. The designation "your prince" signifies Michael's special role in defending God's people, Israel. This highlights the theme of divine protection and the assurance that God has appointed powerful beings to guard His people. Michael's involvement underscores the importance of Israel in God's redemptive plan and the spiritual battles that accompany their history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Book of Daniel, known for his faithfulness and visions concerning the future of Israel and the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angelic_messenger.htm">The Angelic Messenger</a></b><br>Likely Gabriel, who is delivering a message to Daniel.

The same hostile forces are still in view&#8212;powerful demonic rulers influencing human empires (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;no one has the courage&#8221; underscores the intensity of the struggle. God&#8217;s loyal angels are mighty (<a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16-17</a>) but still finite; when dispatched, they sometimes stand alone against entrenched evil.<p>&#8226; This isolation highlights the seriousness of intercessory prayer. Daniel&#8217;s three weeks of mourning and fasting (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2-3</a>) coincided with the angel&#8217;s battle, illustrating how God links our petitions with His invisible warfare (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>except Michael your prince</b><p>The sentence ends, &#8220;except Michael your prince.&#8221; Here the spotlight shifts to Michael, Israel&#8217;s special guardian:<p>&#8226; Michael appears by name only in <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>,21; 12:1; <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>; and <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>.

The verse reassures us that history, warfare, and deliverance all unfold under the flawless authorship of the Lord who has declared, &#8220;My purpose will stand, and I will accomplish all that I please&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">But.</span>--A further contrast is introduced by the adversative. This may be brought out by paraphrasing the verse as follows: "It is true that the prince of Javan will attack you, but do not despair at the thought of one persecuting empire succeeding another. It is all written in the Scripture of truth:" that is, in the revelations which God had already conveyed, or shortly would convey, to Daniel, and in the book of Providence (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm" title="Your eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in your book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.">Psalm 139:16</a>). We have here a striking parallel to our Saviour's words, "Lo, I have told you before."<p><span class= "bld">And there is none</span> . . .--A still further ground of encouragement. Michael, who stood up as Israel's champion under the Persian troubles, will prove himself strong against the evil powers which lead Javan.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span> The LXX. rendering is, "And in very truth (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) I will show thee the first things in the writing of truth: and there was no one helping with me against these, but Michael the angel." The Septuagint translator read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hara'sheem</span>), "the heads," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harashoom</span>), written with a inserted as <span class="accented">mater lectionis.</span> Theodotion is in accordance with our English Version. The Peshitta renders, "Yet will I show thee something noted in the writing of truth; and there was none in all these who helped me but Michael your prince." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic and the English. <span class="accented">But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">abal</span>) is a strongly adversative conjunction. The use of it is explained by Kranichfeld and Zockler as due to the fears for the theocracy aroused by the thought that the Greek power was rising against Israel. If the idea had been that Gabriel was called to hurry back to his post because of the threatened approach of the Prince of Grecia, then it might be defended; only even then either the fact of the necessity for speedy return to the Persian court would have been emphasized, or the fact that he is delaying to make known the contents of the writing of truth. It is, perhaps, better rendered by "nevertheless," as it is in <a href="/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. We can see the force of this particle by turning to ver. 7, "I Daniel alone saw the vision, for the men that were with me saw not the vision, but (equivalent to 'nevertheless') a great quaking fell upon them." This clause, we see, then, has all the appearance of being intruded violently into the text; it interrupts the progress of thought, and does not suit the context. There is no indication that he, Gabriel, will have to hasten back to the court of Persia with such rapidity as would necessitate the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">abal</span>), "nevertheless." But even so, why revert in the next clause to the contents of ver. 20, without the slightest indication that the line of thought in the past clause was dropped as soon as taken up? The last clause of this verse reads much better in connection with ver. 20 than with ver. 21<span class="accented">a</span>. Behrmann transposes the clauses in this verse, so as to get over tiffs difficulty, and Professor M. Stuart puts the first clause in brackets. "The scripture of truth" is a phrase that might have been suggested by <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, "In thy book were all my members written." It is in line with a great number of phrases in apocalyptic literature; thus Enoch 93:1, "And after that Enoch began to recount from the books;" the Book of Jubilees, 1:24; 4:31; 5:15, etc., "the tablets of the heavens." The idea was that all the events that were to happen in the world's history were record, d beforehand in the books or tablets of the heavens. It is from failing to notice this that the late Professor Fuller was led to say "the scripture of truth "is the title for the ensuing section. Against this view is the preposition "in;" it is in the scripture of truth, among other matters, that these things are noted which form the succeeding section. At the same time, the form the representation of the heavenly books, which note beforehand what was to happen, assumes here is simpler than that in Enoch or the Book of Jubilees. <span class="accented">And there is none that holdeth with me in these things</span>, <span class="accented">but Michael your</span> prince. As we have above said, this clause is closely connected with ver. 20. <span class="accented">In these things.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version "against these," in accordance with the majority of recent commentators, Ewald, Hitzig, Fuller, Zockler, Bevan, Stuart, Kranlohfeld Keil, Kliefoth, Behrmann, etc., and, among older commentators, Jephet-ibn-Ali; but none of the older versions have it. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta has the preposition; the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in his omnibus.</span> With these Calvin agrees, though Luther renders, <span class="accented">wider jene.</span> Certainly, the most common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> in such a connection is "against." So, notwithstanding the weight of the versions, we feel constrained to translate, "against these persons," and not "in regard to these things." In the first place, "in" is a far less frequent meaning of the preposition, and next, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">aylayh</span>), "these," most naturally refers to the persons last named. Although "the Prince of Grecia" was to be the instrument of the overthrow of the power of Persia, it was to become oppressive afterwards, as had been revealed to Daniel in the vision of the ram and the he-goat. Gabriel, the angel of prophecy, the special guardian of God's great ideal kingdom of heaven, was assisted in his guardianship only by Michael, the angelic Prince of Israel. The fact that along the line of the development of Israel as a nation ran, so far at least, the Divine plan concerning the kingdom of heaven, made it natural that Michael should favour that which furthered the interests of the race that was more specially under his care. As we have already said, we cannot even guess at the nature of these angelic conflicts. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_61.htm">Strong's 61: </a> </span><span class="str2">Verily, of a truth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ag&#183;g&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
