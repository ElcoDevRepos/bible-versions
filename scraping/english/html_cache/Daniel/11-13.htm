The "king of the North" is typically identified with the Seleucid Empire, which was located in the region of modern-day Syria and parts of Turkey. Historically, this aligns with the actions of Antiochus III, also known as Antiochus the Great, who sought to expand his territory and influence. The raising of another army indicates a period of military buildup and preparation for renewed conflict, reflecting the ongoing power struggles of the era.<p><b>larger than the first</b><br>This suggests a significant increase in military strength compared to previous campaigns. Historically, Antiochus III's campaigns were marked by strategic alliances and territorial expansions, which required substantial military resources. The emphasis on a larger army underscores the intensity and scale of the conflict between the Seleucid Empire and its rivals, particularly the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, which is often referred to as the "king of the South" in the context of Daniel.<p><b>and after some years</b><br>This indicates a passage of time between military campaigns, suggesting a period of regrouping, planning, and resource accumulation. Historically, this aligns with the years of preparation and consolidation of power by Antiochus III before launching further military endeavors. The phrase highlights the patience and strategic planning involved in ancient warfare, as well as the cyclical nature of conflict in the Hellenistic period.<p><b>he will advance with a great army</b><br>The advancement with a great army signifies a major military campaign, likely aimed at reclaiming or expanding territory. This reflects the historical campaigns of Antiochus III, who sought to reassert control over regions that had been lost or contested. The term "great army" emphasizes the formidable nature of the military force, which would have included a diverse array of troops and possibly mercenaries, reflecting the complex military strategies of the time.<p><b>and many supplies</b><br>The mention of "many supplies" highlights the logistical considerations of ancient warfare. Successful military campaigns required not only soldiers but also provisions, equipment, and other resources. This detail underscores the importance of supply lines and resource management in sustaining large-scale military operations. Historically, Antiochus III's campaigns were marked by careful planning and resource allocation, which were crucial for maintaining the effectiveness and morale of his forces.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the northern territories relative to Israel, historically associated with the Seleucid Empire.

His earlier defeat at Raphia did not end the conflict with Egypt, and Scripture records his continuing ambition just as <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will raise another army</b><p>God foretells that Antiochus would not remain passive. After returning home, he rebuilt his forces&#8212;exactly as <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a> prophesies and as <a href="/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10</a> hints: &#8220;His sons will mobilize for war.&#8221; We see here the faithful pattern of fulfilled prophecy that reassures believers today (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>larger than the first</b><p>The new force Antiochus raised eclipsed the earlier army defeated at Raphia (approx. 217 BC). Ancient records confirm that his later campaign involved more troops and allies, underscoring the literal precision of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/psalms/33-4.htm">Psalm 33:4</a>). The numerical growth of the army also foreshadows final-hour coalitions foretold in <a href="/revelation/16-13.htm">Revelation 16:13-16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and after some years</b><p>Roughly fourteen years passed before Antiochus attacked again (<a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a>; compare with the &#8220;time, times, and half a time&#8221; pattern in <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a> that highlights God&#8217;s control of the calendar). The delay shows that even aggressive leaders move only when the Lord permits (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will advance</b><p>True to the prophecy, Antiochus pressed southward into Coele-Syria and Judea. His advance fulfilled the earlier prediction of <a href="/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9</a> that the northern king would &#8220;march against the realm of the king of the South.&#8221; History, then, confirms Scripture, not vice versa (<a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a great army and many supplies</b><p>Antiochus&#8217; renewed offensive came with ample troops, provisions, and funding. Polybius notes his recruitment from Asia Minor and alliances with Philip V of Macedon, matching the verse&#8217;s stress on &#8220;many supplies.&#8221; By comparison, <a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7-8</a> reminds us that although pagan kings trust vast resources, God&#8217;s people rely on the LORD of hosts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a> foretold, with stunning accuracy, that the Seleucid &#8220;king of the North&#8221; would rebuild a larger force, wait a number of years, and then march south with overwhelming strength. History bears out every detail, proving again the sovereignty of God over nations and the trustworthiness of His Word for every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Shall return.--</span>In this and the next two verses the causes are mentioned to which the failure of the southern king was due.

On the hypothesis that these chapters refer to this period, it is surprising that there should be no allusion to the religious persecutions to which the Jews in Egypt had been subjected by Ptolemy Philopator, who, after his victory at Raphia, attempted to enter the Holy Place, as is mentioned in the Third Book of Maccabees. It should be remembered that the Jews suffered considerably from both parties during the whole of this period; but though the prophecy is supposed to have been written for their comfort and encouragement at this very juncture, yet not a word is said which bears allusion to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches</span>. The LXX. does not differ essentially from this, only <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> comes in unnecessarily by a blunder - the less to be understood, as there seems no word which can have occasioned the misreading, unless it is simply a blunder of hearing for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>; but against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis has <span class="accented">medeenatha.</span> There is also the limitation of the period after which the king of the north will return to "one year" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), "a period of a year." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic . The Peshitta is closer than either of the Greek versions, as neither of them attempts to give, "coming he shall come," which it does. The Vulgate is like Theodotion. The reference here is to the second expedition against Egypt, undertaken by Antiochus after the death of Philopator. After his victory at Raphia, Ptolemy resumed his life of self-indulgence. Antiochus endeavoured to build up his empire by curbing the Parthians; then, after an interval of fourteen years, he once more invaded the territories of the Egyptian monarch. This second invasion resulted in Antiochus gaining possession of all Palestine. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the North</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1508;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
