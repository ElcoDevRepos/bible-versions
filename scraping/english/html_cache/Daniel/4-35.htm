In the context of <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, King Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges God's ultimate authority after experiencing a humbling period of madness. The phrase reflects the biblical theme that human power and pride are insignificant compared to God's majesty (<a href="/isaiah/40-17.htm">Isaiah 40:17</a>). It echoes the idea found in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations' attempts to defy God are futile. Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of divine kingship, where earthly rulers were seen as subordinate to the divine will.<p><b>and He does as He pleases with the army of heaven and the peoples of the earth</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's omnipotence and freedom to act according to His will, both in the celestial realm and on earth. The "army of heaven" refers to the angelic hosts, indicating that even the spiritual beings are under God's command (<a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a>). The phrase underscores the biblical teaching that God's plans cannot be thwarted (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>). It also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus, as the Son of God, exercises authority over both heaven and earth (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p><b>There is no one who can restrain His hand</b><br>This statement affirms God's uncontested power and authority. The imagery of God's "hand" is often used in Scripture to denote His power and intervention in human affairs (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>). The idea that no one can restrain God is a recurring theme, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>, where God's purposes cannot be annulled. This reflects the cultural understanding of the time, where kings were often seen as having absolute power, yet even they are subject to God's will.<p><b>or say to Him, &#8216;What have You done?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase speaks to the unquestionable nature of God's actions and decisions. It suggests that humans are not in a position to challenge or question God's purposes, a theme also found in <a href="/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereign choice. The rhetorical question implies that God's wisdom and knowledge are beyond human comprehension (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). This reflects the ancient worldview that divine actions, though sometimes mysterious, are ultimately just and righteous.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who experienced a humbling encounter with God, leading to his acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and advisor to King Nebuchadnezzar, who interpreted the king's dreams and conveyed God's messages.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire over which Nebuchadnezzar ruled, representing human power and pride.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_army.htm">Heavenly Army</a></b><br>Refers to the celestial beings or angels who serve God's purposes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/peoples_of_the_earth.htm">Peoples of the Earth</a></b><br>All nations and individuals under God's sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control of all things, both in heaven and on earth.

The verse that comes next in order is very short," At that time my kingdom was set up, and my glory was restored to me." This is a condensed statement of what is recorded in the following verse (ver. 36; 33 Massoretic), and we shall consider it in that connection. The verse which succeeds suits more the conclusion of such a letter or proclamation as is here represented, so far as form goes, though the matter shows traces of exaggeration and amplification natural to the Jew. At the same time, it bears a resemblance to the last verse of this chapter, according to the Massoretes, only greatly amplified. It may thus be best to regard this verse as not present in the Septuagint text. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The statement here is true, but Jewish, not Babylonian, in colour. This, along with its absence from the Septuagint, leads us to believe it to be the insertion of a Jewish scribe. On the other hand, it looks like a statement in brief of what we find expanded in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. and elsewhere. If brevity is to be regarded as an evidence of antiquity, this passage might be taken as the more ancient. It is, however, too bald and prosaic to be the original of such an impassioned passage as that in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
