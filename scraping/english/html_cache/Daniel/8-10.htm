Historically, Antiochus IV desecrated the Jewish temple and sought to eradicate Jewish worship, fulfilling this prophecy in a literal sense.

Antiochus IV's actions, such as the abomination of desolation in the temple, are historical examples of this trampling. This phrase also foreshadows future persecutions faced by God's people, serving as a reminder of the ongoing spiritual battle between the forces of good and evil.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">tappayl</span>) translated "cast down," has been read as if it had been <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">tooppal</span>). So too the last verb has evidently been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">vayyir'msoohoo</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">vattir'msaym</span>), due to the resemblance which there was between <span class="accented">yod</span> and tan in the older script. Theodotion differs hardly less from the Massoretic, "And it was magnified to the power of heaven, and it fell to the earth from the power of heaven and from the stars, and they trode them down." The verb translated "fell" is evidently read with a vocalization different from both the Massoretic and the LXX The sense of Theodotion is more in accordance with the Septuagint than with the Massoretic. The Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. The question of which reading is to be preferred can scarcely be settled without regarding the meaning of the terms here used. The crucial point is - What is the meaning of the "host of heaven"? The general consensus of interpreters is that this refers to Israel. Some maintain that the best of heaven is Israel, and the stars their leaders (Glassins); the stars are the Levites (Grotius). Moses Stuart would hold the host to be the priests, and the stars the teachers. Kliefoth is right in commencing first with the picture, and requiring that it be realized in thought. The horn grows and grows before Daniel's gaze, until it seems to touch the stars, that is, the host of heaven. As to what is meant by the stars, we must look elsewhere for an explanation. Have we any right to take "the host of heaven" as meaning the people of God? The phrase, "host of heaven," occurs elsewhere in Scripture nearly a score of times, and it rover means anything else than the stars or the angels. Therefore all interpretations that make this mean either the people of God or the Levites, must be thrown aside. It may, however, mean the people of God mediately. A quite elaborate line of deduction has been brought forward - the promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), to Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>), that their seed should be as the stars of heaven, is brought into connection with the use of the word "hosts" in regard to Israel (<a href="/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>, etc.) - and the title given to God as the God of Israel, "Jehovah of hosts." This is very ingenious, but it has no support from scriptural usage or from the usage in apocalyptic writings. In the Book of Enoch, which, since it is modelled on this book, furnishes us with the earliest commentary on it, we find the stars are invariably the symbol of the angels. When we pass to the Book of Revelation, we find the same thing. We find when we pass on to the tenth chapter of this book, that all the nations are regarded as under the rule of some special angel We must apply, so far as we can, rules of interpretation which the author himself supplies us with. Using this guide, we see next that, when a nation was defeated and oppressed, its angel or star was regarded as thrown to the earth and trodden underfoot. The treatment Epiphanes meted out to Egypt and Palestine seems specially referred to. If we take the reading of the LXX., then the reference will be to the humiliation Epiphanes received at the hands of the Romans first, and then the Jews, and lastly the Elamites, whose temple he attempted to plunder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It grew as high</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7713;&#183;dal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
