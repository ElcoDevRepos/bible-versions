His exclamation is a moment of pride and self-glorification, reflecting his belief in his own power and achievements. This moment is significant as it sets the stage for his subsequent humbling by God, illustrating the biblical theme that pride precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Is this not Babylon the Great</b><br>Babylon was one of the most magnificent cities of the ancient world, renowned for its impressive architecture, including the Hanging Gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The phrase "Babylon the Great" emphasizes the city's grandeur and the king's pride in its splendor. In biblical prophecy, Babylon often symbolizes human pride and opposition to God (<a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>).<p><b>which I myself have built</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's claim of having built Babylon highlights his role in its expansion and beautification. Historically, he undertook massive construction projects, including temples, walls, and palaces. This statement reflects the human tendency to take credit for achievements without acknowledging God's sovereignty, a theme echoed in the Tower of Babel narrative (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><b>as a royal residence</b><br>The royal residence refers to the king's palace, a symbol of his power and authority. Archaeological discoveries have uncovered remnants of Nebuchadnezzar's palace, confirming its grandeur. The palace served not only as a home but also as a center of administration and a display of wealth and power.<p><b>by the might of my power</b><br>This phrase underscores Nebuchadnezzar's belief in his own strength and ability. It reflects a worldview that attributes success to human effort rather than divine providence. The Bible consistently teaches that true power and authority come from God (<a href="/psalms/62-11.htm">Psalm 62:11</a>), and this statement sets up the king's impending lesson in humility.<p><b>and for the glory of my majesty?&#8221;</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's focus on his own glory contrasts with the biblical teaching that all glory belongs to God (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). His statement reveals a heart of pride and self-exaltation, which ultimately leads to his downfall. This moment foreshadows the humbling of the king, serving as a reminder of the dangers of pride and the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who is speaking in this verse.

The verse warns us to trade proud self-congratulation for humble gratitude, directing every achievement to God&#8217;s glory alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Great Babylon.--</span>The area of Babylon is said to have been 200 square miles. It was surrounded by walls 85 feet in width, 335 feet high. In these were brazen gates leading to various terraces which faced the river Euphrates. Within the walls the city was laid out in smaller towns, separated from each other by parks and plantations and gardens; in fact, it is stated that corn sufficient for the whole population could be grown within the walls. There were also magnificent public buildings. Nebuchadnezzar (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. v., pp. 113-135) mentions no less than eight temples which he completed, besides the huge temple of Merodach immediately across the Euphrates facing the royal palace. Walking on the flat roof of this palace, and with this grand spectacle before him, the king uttered these words. True, indeed, they were, but they show that during the twelve months which had been allotted to the king for repentance his pride remained unabated; he had not repented as Daniel had counselled him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?</span> The meaning of the Septuagint rendering is the same as the above, "This is Babylon the great, which I built, and the house of my kingdom is it called, in the might of my power, to the honour of my glory." Theodotion and the Peshitta in the main agree with the received text. It is one of the characteristics of the earlier Chaldean monarchs who reigned over the small Chaldean cantons in Mesopotamia, that they named their capital city from themselves, as Bit-Dakuri and Bit-Adini; the capital of Merodach-Baladan was called after his father, Bit-Jakin. We need scarcely explain that <span class="accented">bit</span> represents <span class="accented">beth</span>, "house." In all ages an imperial power has expressed its greatness in the splen-dour of its capital, but in the case of the Babylonian Empire, Nebuchadnezzar was the empire, therefore the splendour of the city was a testimony to his glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">exclaimed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Is this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1668.htm">Strong's 1668: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3809.htm">Strong's 3809: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Babylon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_895.htm">Strong's 895: </a> </span><span class="str2">Babylon -- an eastern Mediterranean empire and its capital city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Great,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(rab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7229.htm">Strong's 7229: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abundant </span><br /><br /><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I myself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_576.htm">Strong's 576: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1457;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1492;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#277;&#183;nay&#183;&#7791;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular &#124;
