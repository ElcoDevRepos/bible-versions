The "rage" indicates a strong emotional response, likely due to previous conflicts or provocations. The Ptolemaic dynasty was known for its wealth and power, often clashing with the Seleucid Empire to the north. This conflict is part of the larger series of wars known as the Syrian Wars, which were fought between these two Hellenistic kingdoms. The king's rage suggests a personal vendetta or a significant political motivation driving him to battle.<p><b>to fight the king of the North,</b><br>The king of the North is typically identified as the Seleucid ruler, who controlled a vast territory that included parts of modern-day Turkey, Syria, and Iran. The Seleucid Empire was a major power in the Hellenistic world, often in conflict with the Ptolemaic kingdom over control of the Levant. This ongoing struggle for dominance in the region is a key theme in the historical context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>. The phrase highlights the geopolitical tension between these two powers, which had significant implications for the Jewish people living in the contested territories.<p><b>who will raise a large army,</b><br>The ability of the king of the North to raise a large army underscores the military might and resources of the Seleucid Empire. Historically, the Seleucids were known for their formidable military forces, which included a mix of Greek and local troops. This phrase indicates the scale of the conflict and the seriousness of the threat posed by the northern king. The large army also reflects the strategic importance of the conflict, as both sides were willing to commit significant resources to achieve their objectives.<p><b>but it will be delivered into the hand of his enemy.</b><br>This outcome suggests a surprising or divinely orchestrated reversal of fortunes, where despite the numerical or strategic advantage, the king of the North's army is defeated. This could be seen as a fulfillment of divine prophecy, where God intervenes in the affairs of nations to accomplish His purposes. The phrase "delivered into the hand" implies a decisive victory for the king of the South, which may have been unexpected given the circumstances. This theme of divine intervention and the ultimate sovereignty of God over human affairs is a recurring motif in the book of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_south.htm">King of the South</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as the ruler of Egypt, often associated with the Ptolemaic dynasty during the Hellenistic period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>Typically identified with the Seleucid Empire, which was located in the region of modern-day Syria and surrounding areas.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_multitude.htm">Great Multitude</a></b><br>Refers to the large army assembled by the king of the North, indicating the scale and intensity of the conflict.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The confrontation between the two kings, symbolizing the ongoing power struggles and political turmoil of the era.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance_into_his_hand.htm">Deliverance into His Hand</a></b><br>The outcome of the battle, where the king of the South gains victory over the king of the North's forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_historical_context.htm">Understanding Historical Context</a></b><br>Recognize the historical backdrop of the Hellenistic period, which helps us understand the geopolitical dynamics at play in <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_history.htm">God's Sovereignty in History</a></b><br>Despite the chaos and conflict, God's sovereign plan unfolds.

The verse warns against rash anger, reliance on sheer numbers, and confidence in human strength, while assuring believers that every shift in world affairs unfolds under the purposeful hand of the Lord who authored history in advance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And the king.</span>--The ambiguity of this verse is very great. "He" may refer to either king; so that while some commentators see in the words an account of the successes of Ptolemy against Antiochus in the battle of Raphia (B.C. 217)--the "multitude" being the army of Antiochus, which was severely defeated at that place--others infer that the northern king is represented as defeating his rival. Evidently the words "with the king of the north" are added, as in <a href="/exodus/2-6.htm" title="And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.">Exodus 2:6</a>, for the sake of clearness. This makes it most probable that the first of the two interpretations just given is correct, and that "he" refers to the northern king, "his hand" to the hand of the southern king. This is supported by <a href="/daniel/11-12.htm" title="And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.">Daniel 11:12</a>, where we read of the conduct of the southern king after his victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth, and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</span> The LXX. differs a little from the Massoretic, "And the King of Egypt shall be much embittered and enraged, and shall come forth and fight with the king of the north; and he shall set forth (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) a great multitude, and the multitude shall be betrayed into his hands." Theodotion, like this, differs from the Massoretic by inserting, "the king of the north," without the pronoun, as do all the other versions. Ptolemy. usually slothful and lethargic, was at length roused, and placed an army of seventy-five thousand men in the field. Against this Antiochus opposed the slightly superior army of seventy-eight thousand The two armies engaged at Raphia, and Antiochus sustained a severe defeat, losing no less than ten thousand men. The multitude commanded by Antiochus was given into the hands of Ptolemy Pifilopator. This seems the only interpretation which is consistent with facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In a rage,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;mar&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
