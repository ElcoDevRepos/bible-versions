The context is a vision Daniel receives during the reign of Darius. The angel Gabriel, who is known for delivering messages from God, is the one instructing Daniel. This highlights the importance of the message, as Gabriel also appeared to Mary in the New Testament to announce the birth of Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>). The act of instruction suggests a divine revelation, emphasizing the role of angels as messengers and teachers in biblical narratives.<p><b>O Daniel,</b><br>The use of Daniel's name signifies a personal and intimate communication. Daniel, whose name means "God is my judge," is a key figure in the Old Testament known for his unwavering faith and integrity. His experiences in Babylon, including interpreting dreams and surviving the lion's den, demonstrate his role as a prophet and a man of God. The personal address underscores the significance of the message and Daniel's favored status before God.<p><b>I have come now</b><br>This indicates a specific mission and timing. Gabriel's arrival is in response to Daniel's prayer and fasting, as described earlier in the chapter. The immediacy of "now" suggests the urgency and importance of the message. It also reflects the divine timing in God's plan, as seen throughout scripture where God intervenes at critical moments, such as the Exodus or the coming of Christ.<p><b>to give you insight and understanding.</b><br>The purpose of Gabriel's visit is to provide Daniel with wisdom and clarity regarding the vision he has seen. Insight and understanding are gifts from God, often associated with the Holy Spirit's work in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-16</a>). This phrase highlights the theme of divine revelation, where God imparts knowledge to His prophets to guide His people.

God consistently takes the role of Instructor: &#8220;I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p>- Daniel has been poring over Jeremiah&#8217;s writings (<a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>). By sending an angelic tutor, the Lord shows that He personally oversees our understanding of His Word, just as He later promised, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart &#8230; and He will make your paths straight&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>- The verb reminds us that revelation is not left to guesswork&#8212;God initiates, explains, and grounds His truth (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spoke with me</b><p>- Scripture often highlights that God &#8220;spoke&#8221; so we know His message is verbal, clear, and authoritative (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). Here, Daniel experiences what Moses once did when &#8220;the LORD would speak with Moses face to face&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>- Personal conversation underscores relationship. Jesus echoed this pattern with His disciples: &#8220;I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>- The tiny word signals that what follows is not guesswork or inner impression; Gabriel delivers a precise statement. God&#8217;s Word never returns void (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>), so Daniel can bank on every syllable.<p>- Clear speech prevents confusion&#8212;&#8220;unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-9.htm">1 Corinthians 14:9</a>). Gabriel&#8217;s announcement leaves no room for ambiguity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Daniel</b><p>- The angel calls Daniel by name, echoing God&#8217;s tender &#8220;I have called you by name; you are Mine&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>).<p>- Personal address underscores Daniel&#8217;s favored status: &#8220;O Daniel, man greatly beloved&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>). Such affection prefigures Christ&#8217;s words, &#8220;He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have come now</b><p>- The immediacy answers Daniel&#8217;s prayer that had just ascended &#8220;while I was still praying&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a>). Heaven is not slow to respond to repentant hearts (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>).<p>- Gabriel&#8217;s mission mirrors later New-Testament scenes: &#8220;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>). Angels are &#8220;ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to give you insight</b><p>- God never exposes sin without also illuminating truth. Daniel had sought clarity about the seventy-year exile; now light dawns. &#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you, and show you great and unsearchable things you do not know&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>- The Spirit later fulfills the same role for all believers, &#8220;revealing even the deep things of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-12</a>). Real insight originates with the Lord: &#8220;For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and understanding.</b><p>- Insight becomes practical when it moves from mind to heart. Paul prayed, &#8220;that God may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation &#8230; that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>).<p>- God offers this to any who ask: &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). Daniel receives not merely facts but comprehension of God&#8217;s timetable and redemptive plan (<a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-22.htm">Daniel 9:22</a> shows a loving God who answers sincere prayer by sending Gabriel to teach Daniel. The verse highlights divine initiative (&#8220;He instructed me&#8221;), personal communication (&#8220;spoke with me&#8221;), affectionate address (&#8220;O Daniel&#8221;), immediate intervention (&#8220;I have come now&#8221;), and the gracious goal (&#8220;to give you insight and understanding&#8221;). God still delights to reveal His purposes to those who humbly seek Him in His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">He informed me</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, gave me understanding (as <a href="/daniel/9-2.htm" title="In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.">Daniel 9:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>). The angel gave Daniel understanding in the perplexing words of Jeremiah, showing him that what affected his people was a period of seventy weeks that were yet to come, rather than seventy years which were already passed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding</span>. The LXX. and Peshitta render the first clause, "And he approached and talked with me." It is difficult to understand how that reading could have arisen from the Massoretic text, or how, on the other hand, the Massoretie text could have arisen from that behind the Septuagint. The rendering of the Septuagint in the last clause is better than that in our Authorized Version, and is in accordance with our Revised, "to make thee skilful of understanding." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic. Although Daniel was highly endowed, and although he had before him the inspired words of Jeremiah, he had need of yet higher endowments to understand the secrets of the Divine plan. He knew that if he reckoned seventy years from the time when he himself had been carried captive, then the period was drawing to a close: but the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people were still there. It might be that God would restrain the fulfilment of his promise; the more so that, if the prophecy of Jeremiah were reckoned from the fall of Jerusalem, twenty years would yet have to run. Daniel is concerned about the <span class="accented">sins</span> of his people, knowing that, unless they were removed, renewed punishment would befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision</span>. The version of the LXX. differs somewhat from this, "In the beginning of thy prayer a commandment came from the Lord, and I came to show thee, because thou art merciful, and do thou understand (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) the command." The other versions do not present much worthy of remark. <span class="accented">At the beginning of thy supplications.</span> This affords a reason why it was while Daniel "was yet speaking," that Gabriel came to him; the moment the desire was strong enough to shape itself in words, the answer was on the way. <span class="accented">The commandment came forth.</span> The word translated "commandment" is the very common Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">dabar</span>), "a word," "a thing," "a matter," in which sense it occurs in the penultimate clause of this verse. <span class="accented">And I am come to show thee.</span> The angel Gabriel is the messenger sent forth to interpret to Daniel the ways of God with his people. The angel Gabriel is sent to give Daniel an explanatory oracle or word that he may be comforted concerning his people. The reason of this is, "for thou art greatly beloved." This phrase has caused considerable difference of opinion. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta, <span class="accented">regee</span>; Jerome, <span class="accented">vir desideriorum</span>; Hitzig's rendering is "darling" (<span class="accented">liebling</span>); Ewald, "dearly beloved one." <span class="accented">Hemoodoth</span> means "desires," "loves;" hence may either be understood subjectively or objectively; in this case, most probably the latter, "a man, the object of love." <span class="accented">Therefore understand the matter</span>, <span class="accented">and consider the vision.</span> The reader will have observed that the last clause is omitted from the LXX. There is a false succession here. Daniel is first commanded "to understand the matter," and then "to consider the vision." Another rendering of the Massoretic avoids this by neglecting the <span class="accented">ethnach</span>, and connecting <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> with the preceding clause, gives, "thou art greatly beloved and understanding in the matter." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He instructed [me]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
