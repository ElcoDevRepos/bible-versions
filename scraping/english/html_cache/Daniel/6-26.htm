The decree's reach across the entire kingdom signifies the importance and authority of the message. Historically, decrees from kings were binding and carried significant weight, often inscribed on stone or clay tablets for permanence.<p><b>men are to tremble in fear before the God of Daniel:</b><br>The phrase "tremble in fear" indicates a deep reverence and awe, not merely terror. This reflects a recognition of God's supreme power and authority. The "God of Daniel" highlights Daniel's influence and the impact of his faithfulness, as his God is acknowledged by a pagan king. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God's power is recognized by non-believers, such as Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>For He is the living God,</b><br>The term "living God" contrasts with the lifeless idols worshiped by many in the ancient world. It emphasizes God's active presence and involvement in the world. This concept is echoed throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, where God is described as living and true.<p><b>and He endures forever;</b><br>This phrase speaks to God's eternal nature, a central tenet of biblical theology. Unlike human rulers and kingdoms, which are temporary, God's existence is unending. This is a theme found throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, affirming God's timelessness and constancy.<p><b>His kingdom will never be destroyed,</b><br>The indestructibility of God's kingdom contrasts with earthly kingdoms, which rise and fall. This is a prophetic statement pointing to the eternal kingdom of God, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>, where the eternal reign of Christ is proclaimed.<p><b>and His dominion will never end.</b><br>God's unending dominion signifies His ultimate authority and control over all creation. This is a reassurance of God's sovereignty, a theme prevalent in the Psalms and throughout prophetic literature. It also foreshadows the eternal reign of Christ, as described in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where His kingdom is declared to last forever.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius_the_mede.htm">Darius the Mede</a></b><br>The king who issued the decree after witnessing Daniel's miraculous deliverance from the lions' den.
