The "two-horned ram" symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire, as explained earlier in the chapter. The two horns represent the dual nature of the empire, with the Medes and the Persians. This imagery is consistent with the vision in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, where different beasts represent successive empires. The approach of the goat toward the ram signifies the impending conflict and conquest.<p><b>I had seen standing beside the canal</b><br>The canal mentioned here is likely the Ulai Canal, located in the region of Susa, an important city in the Persian Empire. This geographical detail roots the vision in a real-world location, emphasizing the historical context of the prophecy. Susa was a significant administrative center, and its mention highlights the importance of the events being foretold. The standing position of the ram suggests its established power and dominance before the arrival of the goat.<p><b>and rushed at him with furious power</b><br>The phrase "rushed at him with furious power" captures the swift and aggressive nature of Alexander the Great's military campaigns. Historically, Alexander's conquests were marked by rapid and decisive victories, which led to the swift downfall of the Persian Empire. This imagery of furious power underscores the intensity and effectiveness of his military strategy. The prophecy aligns with historical accounts of Alexander's unstoppable advance, reflecting the fulfillment of God's sovereign plan as revealed through Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two-horned_ram.htm">The Two-Horned Ram</a></b><br>Represents the kings of Media and Persia, as explained later in <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>.
