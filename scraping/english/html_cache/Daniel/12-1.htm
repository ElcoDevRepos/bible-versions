It connects to the broader eschatological themes found in the Book of Daniel and Revelation, indicating a specific future period of divine intervention and fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>Michael, the great prince who stands watch over your people,</b><br>Michael is identified as an archangel in <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> and <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>. He is depicted as a protector of Israel, suggesting a heavenly guardian role. This aligns with Jewish tradition, where Michael is seen as a defender of God's people. His role emphasizes the spiritual warfare and divine protection over Israel.<p><b>will rise up.</b><br>The rising up of Michael signifies a decisive action or intervention. This can be seen as a preparation for the final battle against evil forces, as described in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. It indicates a shift in the spiritual realm, where Michael takes an active role in the unfolding events of the end times.<p><b>There will be a time of distress,</b><br>This distress is often interpreted as the Great Tribulation, a period of unprecedented suffering and turmoil. It is paralleled in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, where Jesus speaks of a similar time of great tribulation. This period is characterized by intense persecution and challenges for God's people.<p><b>the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time.</b><br>This phrase underscores the unparalleled nature of the coming distress. It echoes the language of <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm">Jeremiah 30:7</a>, which describes a time of trouble for Jacob. The emphasis is on the severity and uniqueness of this period in human history.<p><b>But at that time your people&#8212;</b><br>"Your people" refers to the Jewish nation, the descendants of Daniel's people. It highlights God's covenant relationship with Israel and His commitment to their ultimate deliverance and restoration.<p><b>everyone whose name is found written in the book&#8212;</b><br>The "book" is often understood as the Book of Life, mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>. It symbolizes those who are righteous and have eternal life.

Michael&#8217;s rise affirms heavenly involvement in earthly crises. The distress proves God&#8217;s warnings are literal and comprehensive. The deliverance highlights His unfailing covenant love and individual care. Together the verse calls every reader to trust the Lord who both foretells and fulfills, guarding His people through the darkest hour into everlasting rescue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">At that time</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the times spoken of in <a href="/daniel/11-45.htm" title="And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.">Daniel 11:45</a>, previous to the overthrow of the king. During the tribulation which precedes his overthrow, Michael (see <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm" title="But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.">Daniel 10:13</a>) comes to stand up in aid of the people.<p><span class= "bld">A time of trouble.--</span>This is the tribulation spoken of in Matt. in <a href="/context/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.">Matthew 24:21-22</a>, which follows, as it does in the Book of Daniel, the wars, rumours of wars, and uprisings of sundry nations. (See <a href="/context/matthew/24-6.htm" title="And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.">Matthew 24:6-7</a>.) It should be observed that the mere presence of Michael does not avert the times of trouble. He helps God's people during the time of their trouble. On the mode in which the intensity of the tribulation is described, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/30-7.htm" title="Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.">Jeremiah 30:7</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - THE LAST THINGS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standsth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</span> The rendering of the Septuagint is "And unto that place shall come Michael the archangel, who standeth over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) the children of thy people; that day shall be a day of affliction, such as was not from the day when they were [presumably the Jews as a nation] till that day, and in that day every people shall be exalted whose name is found written in the book," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, "In that time shall stand up Michael, the great prince that standeth for the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as there has not been since there was a nation upon the earth till that time: in that time shall thy people be saved, every one who is written in the book." The Peshitta rendering is, "At that time shall stand up Michael, the great angel who is overseer over the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as has not been from the days of eternity; there shall be delivered of the children of thy people every one who is found written in the book." The rendering of the Vulgate is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The difference in the first clause between the text of the Septuagint and that represented by the Massoretic text and that of the versions which follow it is of importance. It is hardly possible to suggest any Hebrew word for the place which can have been suggested by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, the word used here for "time." Both versions of the clause look like attempts to supply a link of connection which was awanting in the text before them. This supports our idea that the eleventh chapter is mainly an interpolation. It would seem that the Septuagint translator had before him a text having some derivative possibly of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, perhaps in the passive of the pilpel, which has no extant example. <span class="accented">And at that time.</span> The connection would naturally imply the time of the destruction of the oppressor - the king of the south. When he was cut off "without a helper" would be a time one would expect of joy, not of affliction. It may refer to the coming of the oppressor from Egypt with "great rage." If that produced the great affliction, what is the result of Michael's standing up? It seems as if the connection here were hopelessly broken; some dislocation has occurred. <span class="accented">Michael the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people</span> (see <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>). "Thy people," this pronominal suffix only occurs once in the previous chapter, in the fourteenth verse, in a clause that does not harmonize with the context - a clause that we think is a portion of the missing vision of Daniel. <span class="accented">Shall stand up.</span> This, taken in connection with his function, means he shall come for the help of Israel. <span class="accented">And there shall be a time of trouble</span>, <span class="accented">such as never was since there was a nation.</span> This is certainly not what might be expected to result from Michael arising for the deliverance of the people of God. It certainly may be intended to explain the fact that Michael does "stand up." But in the succeeding verses we have no account of special deliverance being given to Israel. The natural meaning of this would be that from the time that Israel began to be a nation there had not been such affliction. It might mean that never since there were nations had there been such a persecution. Father of these interpretations would be true. Never in the history of Israel had there been such a persecution, because the attempt to force the people to worship Jupiter was met by a far fiercer resistance than that which met Jezebel's attempt to make Israel worshippers of Baal. The people were not then so permeated with love and honour to Jehovah as they were now. Further, there was more kindred between Baal-worship and that of Jehovah originally than between the latter and the worship of Jupiter. Baal means simply" Lord," and Jehovah seems to have been worshipped under that title (<a href="/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>). A collateral proof of this is the fact that Saul named one of his sons after "Baal" - Eshbaal (equivalent to Ishbosheth), <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; and Jonathan also named his son from Baal - Meribaal (equivalent to Mephibesheth), <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>. The plea might thus be advanced that Baal-worship was a revival of an ancient cult. Hence the persecution, severe as it was, would not be so severe as tinder Antiochus. Yet, again, the Greek intellect, keen and polished as it was, could persecute in a way more thorough and complete. If fiercer persecution for religious views could not have been at any earlier time in Jewish history, in no other country would there have been any persecution at all, because there would have been no resist-ante to the will of the monarch. Our Lord, in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, has this passage in mind, and uses terms borrowed from it to describe the sufferings to be endured by the Jews at the hands of the Romans. when Jerusalem shall be besieged and taken. It is to be observed that while in Daniel the comparison is only with the past, in Matthew there is added a reference to the future, "No, nor ever shall be." Nothing, then, shall equal the appalling horrors of the siege and sack of Jerusalem. And <span class="accented">at that time thy people shall be delivered.</span> The mere fact of deliverance is mentioned, but the nature of the deliverance is not indicated there; cessation of persecution would not be deliverance, for only Israel was persecuted. The application of the phrases of our Lord have a totally different reference - the Jews perished, the Christians were delivered. There is here another evidence of dislocation. <span class="accented">Every one that shall be found written in the book.</span> There seems to be a faint reminiscence of this in <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and a clearer in <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>. Although "books" is here referred to, and referred to also in <a href="/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>, yet the "books" are different. The "book" in the tenth chapter contains presumably an account beforehand of all that is to happen. This book is, so to speak, a register of the names of those who should stand through the fiery trial that was to try them and maintain their faithfulness. It is to be noted that the Septuagint makes this refer not to individuals, but to nations whose names shall be found written in the book. There seems nothing to justify such a reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
