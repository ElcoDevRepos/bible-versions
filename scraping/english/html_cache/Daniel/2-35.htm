Each material represents a successive kingdom, starting with Babylon (gold) and followed by Medo-Persia (silver), Greece (bronze), Rome (iron), and a divided kingdom (iron mixed with clay). The shattering signifies the ultimate destruction and end of these earthly kingdoms. This aligns with the biblical theme of the transient nature of human power and the sovereignty of God over history.<p><b>and became like chaff on the threshing floor in summer.</b><br>Chaff is the husk of grain that is separated and discarded during the threshing process. In ancient agricultural practices, threshing floors were used to separate grain from chaff, often by using wind to blow away the lighter chaff. This imagery symbolizes the complete and utter destruction of these kingdoms, leaving no trace behind. It reflects the biblical motif of divine judgment, where the wicked are often compared to chaff (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).<p><b>The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found.</b><br>The wind represents God's power and judgment, which effortlessly removes the remnants of these kingdoms. This emphasizes the futility of human endeavors against divine will. The complete disappearance of these kingdoms underscores the finality of God's judgment and the establishment of His eternal kingdom. This can be connected to other scriptures that speak of God's ultimate authority and the impermanence of earthly powers (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23-24</a>).<p><b>But the stone that had struck the statue became a great mountain</b><br>The stone represents the kingdom of God, which is often depicted as a rock or stone in biblical literature (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>). This stone, not made by human hands, signifies the divine origin of God's kingdom. Its growth into a great mountain symbolizes the expansive and enduring nature of God's reign, contrasting with the temporary and fragile nature of human kingdoms. This imagery is prophetic of the coming of Christ, the cornerstone, and the establishment of His eternal kingdom (<a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><b>and filled the whole earth.</b><br>This phrase indicates the universal scope and dominion of God's kingdom. Unlike the previous kingdoms, which were limited in time and space, God's kingdom will encompass the entire earth and endure forever. This reflects the biblical promise of a new heaven and a new earth where God's rule is fully realized (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-3</a>). It also points to the Great Commission, where the gospel is to be spread to all nations, ultimately leading to the fulfillment of God's kingdom on earth (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had the dream of the statue, which Daniel interprets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet who interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream, revealing God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_statue.htm">The Statue</a></b><br>Represents successive world empires, each symbolized by different materials (gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>Represents God's eternal kingdom, which will ultimately replace all earthly kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_threshing_floor.htm">The Threshing Floor</a></b><br>A place where grain is separated from chaff, symbolizing judgment and the impermanence of human kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_kingdoms.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Kingdoms</a></b><br>Earthly powers are temporary and subject to God's ultimate authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impermanence_of_human_achievements.htm">The Impermanence of Human Achievements</a></b><br>Like chaff, human accomplishments without God are fleeting.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_establishment_of_god's_kingdom.htm">The Establishment of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>God's kingdom is eternal and will ultimately prevail over all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy serves to reveal God's plan and encourage faithfulness among believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_as_part_of_god's_kingdom.htm">Living as Part of God's Kingdom</a></b><br>Believers are called to live as citizens of God's eternal kingdom, prioritizing His values over worldly ones.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_35_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_35_God_s_rule_over_kingdoms.htm">How does Daniel 2:35 illustrate God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and powers?

The versions arc closer to the Massoretic than our Authorized Version, as they all give more prominence to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kahadah</span>), "at once." It is rendered "together." The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> the Peshitta repeats the word; and Jerome renders <span class="accented">pariter.</span> Theedotion changes the order somewhat, for the sake of making it more symmetrical. The rendering of the LXX. is in some respects different from the natural sense of the Massoretic text, but not so much so as to require us to presume a radically different text: "Then the iron, and the clay, etc., became fragments, and they were smaller than the chaff of the threshing-floor." We have this verse also in the Itala, preserved to us in Tertullian, but it does not differ from Jerome seriously. It would follow naturally enough if the mighty image were so smitten on its weak and fragile feet, that it would come crashing to the earth; but more happened than this. As the monarch looked, in falling, the various parts of the image, as they fell in a heap, became broken, nay, triturated - they became as the dust or chaff of the summer threshing-floor. Summer is the dead time in the East; harvest is over by the end of June, and the threshing of corn then commences. All this huge statue was reduced to particles as small and light as the chaff that is beaten off the grain by the threshing instruments of those days - feet of oxen or wheel of cart. Chaff is a favourite symbol for lightness and worthlessness. In the first psalm the wicked are compared to chaff; so in <a href="/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28</a>. In Hosea, where he speaks (<a href="/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>) of Israel's <span class="accented">sins</span>, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "Ephraim shall be like the chaff of the threshing-floor." Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15, 16</a>) speaks of Jacob getting new threshing instruments to thresh the mountains, and make them small as chaff. It may be noted that the word here translated "chaff" only occurs here. The word does not appear in the Targums, instead of which is used <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">motz</span>), the Hebrew word. In Syriac, again, in the Peshitta, it occurs frequently, as <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a> - another sign, slight in itself, of the Eastern origin of the Book of Daniel. The fact that the word occurred in Daniel would have a tendency to preserve it if in use when Daniel was published, or introduce it if it were not. Yet, as we have said, it does not appear in the Targums. It does appear in Syriac, the language of a people who, as not Jews, would presumably not be familiar with Daniel. The word for "threshing-floor," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">iddrei</span>), is also one that does not appear in the Targums, but it does appear in the Peshitta. Jensen suggests an Assyrian etymology, but Brockelmann marks this doubtful; Lagarde suggests a Persian etymology, also marked doubtful. Whichever etymology holds bears out the Eastern origin of the book. The Targums represent the older Aramaic of Palestine. If Daniel were a book originating in Palestine, the Persian words appearing in it might also be expected to appear in the Targums. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth</span>. The LXX. rendering is, "And the wind carried them away, so that there was nothing left of them, and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and smote the whole earth." The first portion of this is a fairly correct rendering of our present Massoretic text. On the other hand, the latter clause implies that the translator had before him, or imagined he had, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>; not impossibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> might be written without the silent a; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;</span>, as in the Peshitta. In that case the mistake might easily be made. Behrmann remarks on the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> in this passage being the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>, but does not remark that it is written defectively in Syriac. The sense in the Massoretic text is much better than that implied in this reading. Theodotion's rendering differs in the first clause of this portion of the present verse, "And the abundance (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of wind carried it away, and place was not found for them: and the stone, when it had smitten (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) the image, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." The rendering "multitude" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. This form of the plural of the demonstrative pronoun is the commoner in Biblical Aramaic, but does not appear in the Targums nor the Peshitta. It is akin to the Mandaitic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. Neither the Peshitta nor the Vulgate presents any peculiarities of rendering. All this mass that had formed the image, though it had been gold, silver, brass, and iron, yet was so ground down - had become reduced to particles so small, that the wind carried them away. So scattered were they that they collected in no special place, so that one could say, "This is the image." The figure is still that of the threshing-floor; the wind, blowing on the grain that is lifted up before it, carries away the chaff, but, search as one may, the chaff, once blown away, cannot be found. A more remarkable thing now takes place - the stone that, bounding down the mountainside, had smitten the image on the feet, so that it fell and became as dust, now grows apace, overtopping the utmost height the image had attained, overtopping the mountain from which it had been cut. Not only did it grow in height, but, as it increased in height, its base broadened till the whole earth was filled with it. There seems to be a reference here to <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it." As the monarch gazes in his dream, the change is completed, the huge image, with its glittering head and gleaming breast, its polished thighs and legs of iron, its unseemly feet that inspired terror by its very appearance, had utterly disappeared, and its place was occupied by a mountain, huge but peaceful, on which the flocks might browse and trees might grow. It may be noted, though not as of importance, that the material of the mountain is most akin with that of the weak clay of which the feet of the image were largely composed. Such, then, is the dream which Nebuchadnezzar had seen, and which the prophet now presented once more before him. We must, however, glance at the picture presented by the reading of the LXX. To the translator the picture evidently present was that of a stone descending from the mountain, and increasing in momentum as it descends; but this stone further increases in size, till before its tremendous strokes and rebounds the very solid earth quakes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
