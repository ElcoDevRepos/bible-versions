The directions&#8212;west, north, and south&#8212;indicate the expansion of this empire under the leadership of kings such as Cyrus the Great. Historically, the Medo-Persian Empire expanded westward into Lydia and Ionia, northward into Armenia, and southward into Egypt. This aligns with historical records of the empire's conquests. The absence of an eastern direction suggests that the empire's primary focus was on these other regions, which were more significant in terms of wealth and influence.<p><b>No animal could stand against him,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the dominance and power of the Medo-Persian Empire during its peak. The imagery of no animal being able to stand against the ram suggests that no other kingdom could successfully challenge its authority at that time. This is consistent with historical accounts of the empire's military prowess and strategic alliances, which made it a formidable force in the ancient world. The use of "animal" in the vision symbolizes other nations or empires, highlighting the theme of divine sovereignty over earthly kingdoms.<p><b>and there was no deliverance from his power.</b><br>The phrase indicates the total control and unchallenged authority of the Medo-Persian Empire over its conquered territories. This reflects the historical reality of the empire's administrative efficiency and military strength, which left little room for rebellion or escape. Theologically, this can be seen as a demonstration of God's allowance for certain empires to rise and fall according to His divine plan, as seen throughout the prophetic literature in the Bible.<p><b>He did as he pleased and became great.</b><br>This statement underscores the autonomy and success of the Medo-Persian rulers, particularly Cyrus the Great, who is known for his effective governance and military conquests. The phrase "did as he pleased" suggests a level of unchecked power and authority, which is a recurring theme in the book of Daniel regarding earthly rulers. The greatness achieved by the empire is a testament to its historical significance and the fulfillment of God's prophetic word. This also serves as a reminder of the temporary nature of human power in contrast to God's eternal kingdom, a theme that is prevalent throughout the book of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram.htm">The Ram</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Medo-Persian Empire, as later explained in <a href="/daniel/8-20.htm">Daniel 8:20</a>.

God gave this prophecy decades beforehand to affirm His control over history and to anchor His people&#8217;s trust. Earthly empires surge and fade, but the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand forever, encouraging believers in every age to rest in His unshakable sovereignty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">I saw the ram pushing.--</span>The ram pushes in three different directions.

It is more important to note that in the LXX. we have the four points of the compass mentioned, not merely three as in the Massoretic, "I saw the ram butting eastward, and northward, and westward, and southward." Had <span class="accented">a falsarius</span> been wishful to supply the missing direction, he would have inserted "eastward" between "northward" and "southward," only if he had begun with "eastward" would he have gone on as it at present stands in the Septuagint. What could make him change "west" to "east"? Our opinion is that the LXX. represents the original text. It is confirmatory of this that Theodotion. in strict agreement with the text of the Massoretes, renders the first direction "seaward" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The Peshitta renders "westward," not by <span class="accented">yammah</span>, but by the term for "west" that became common in Exilic and post-Exilic Hebrew, <span class="accented">ma'arab</span> - the word that is used in the next verse. Ezekiel uses <span class="accented">yammah</span> for "west," when in vision he places himself in Palestine, otherwise it is not used for "west" by Exilic and post-Exilic writers. If we take the statement of the next verse as fixing what was "the west" to the author of Daniel, where would "seaward" be? If we draw a line from Tress, where Alexander landed, and continue it through Babylon, it reaches the Persian Gulf. "Seaward" would mean consequently "eastward," or approximately so, to one writing in Babylon. A great number of suggestions have been offered to explain the singular omission of "eastward" from the direction in which the ram pushes with his horns, Havernick, and following him Moses Stuart, assert that "eastward" is not mentioned because the Persians made no conquests to the east until the days of Darius Hystaspis, and then not permanent ones. Against this is the fact that Elam and Media were mainly east of Ansan. Further, the picture here given of the Persian Empire is not restricted to the days of Cyrus and Cambyses, but all through its course. As to the permanence of these Eastern conquests, the territories of Darius Codomannus east of Arbela embraced modern Persia and other territories to the confines of India. Keil assumes that the ram stands on the western bank of the Shapur, so, if he pushed eastward, it would be against his own capital; but if <span class="accented">oobal</span> means "a river," then the only meaning possible for <span class="accented">liphnee</span> is "eastward." He would then be butting towards the river across which the enemy was likely to come, moreover, against his own capital, unless the ram is supposed to be between the river and the city - an unlikely supposition, as Shushan was on the river Eulaeus. He further maintains that the unfolding of the power of Persia was towards these three named directions, and not towards the last, whatever that may mean. Ewald declares the ram does not butt towards the east, because that already belongs to him. As a matter of fact, and, as exhibited by the Book of Esther, welt known to the Jews, the Persian Empire did conquer towards the east. Behrmann says, "The ram does not push towards the east, because he comes from the east - a delicacy the Septuagint overlooked." In point of fact, there is no word in the vision of the ram coming from anywhere - this delicacy (<span class="accented">feinheit</span>) Professor Behrmann has overlooked. Kranich-fold and Zockler follow this. The view of Bishop Newton, followed by Archdeacon Rose, is that the east had no importance to the Jews; but north and south had just a little. Jephet-ihn-Ali and several modern commentators think the three directions, as the three ribs, imply the limitation of the Persian Empire. It certainly was recognized by the Jews to be little, if at all, less than that of Alexander the Great Hitzig propounds in all gravity an absurd view; he assumes that the ram was standing on the west bank of the river, and faced west, and argues that he did not butt eastward because he could not butt backwards. His preliminary assumption is groundless, as we have seen, and rams can change their position. The true explanation is that a direction has dropped out. While "<span class="accented">seaward"</span> had ceased to mean "west" to the Jews in Babylon, it did not take long residence in Palestine to recover this name for "west." A copyist living in Palestine, finding <span class="accented">yammah</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the first place would translate it "westward;" then after "northward" he would, in the third place, come upon <span class="accented">ms'arab</span>, which also meant "<span class="accented">west</span>;" so naturally he dropped the second of what seemed <span class="accented">to</span> him synonymous terms. If we are correct in our supposition, we have here demonstrative proof that Daniel was written by one living in Babylon Are <span class="accented">beasts might stand before him.</span> All the powers round Persia had to submit to him. <span class="accented">And be became great</span> affords proof, if proof were needed, that the vision applies to the whole of the history of Persia. There is little necessity for Moses Stuart's translation, "became haughty." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the ram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1441;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
