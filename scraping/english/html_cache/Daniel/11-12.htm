Historically, this could relate to the battles between these two Hellenistic kingdoms following the division of Alexander the Great's empire. The carrying off of an army suggests a significant loss, possibly involving the capture or destruction of troops, which was a common occurrence in ancient warfare.<p><b>the king of the South will be proud in heart</b><br>The king of the South is typically identified as a ruler from the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. The phrase "proud in heart" indicates arrogance or overconfidence, a common theme in biblical narratives where pride often precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). This pride could stem from a temporary victory or perceived strength, reflecting the human tendency to rely on one's own power rather than on God.<p><b>and will cast down tens of thousands</b><br>This suggests a significant military victory, where the king of the South achieves a substantial defeat over his enemies, likely the forces of the king of the North. The casting down of tens of thousands indicates a large-scale battle with heavy casualties, emphasizing the might and ferocity of the conflict. This aligns with the historical accounts of large battles during the Hellenistic period.<p><b>but he will not triumph</b><br>Despite the initial success and the destruction of many enemies, the ultimate victory is not achieved. This phrase highlights the temporary nature of human achievements and the futility of prideful endeavors. It serves as a reminder of the sovereignty of God over the affairs of nations, as seen throughout the book of Daniel. The lack of triumph could also foreshadow future defeats or the eventual downfall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, aligning with the prophetic nature of Daniel's visions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_south.htm">The King of the South</a></b><br>This refers to the ruler of Egypt, historically understood to be part of the Ptolemaic dynasty during the Hellenistic period.

Nothing happens outside His sovereign plan.<p>&#8226; By recording this event centuries in advance, God confirms the absolute reliability of His Word (cf. <a href="/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king of the South will be filled with pride</b><p>&#8226; Ptolemy IV, the Egyptian ruler, tasted an overwhelming victory and let success swell his heart. Pride always follows when triumph is credited to self instead of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Even a pagan king&#8217;s pride illustrates a universal danger: victories, promotions, or blessings can tempt anyone to self-exaltation if God is forgotten (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative underscores that human pride never catches God off guard; He foretold it here to show His knowledge of every motive (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will slaughter many thousands</b><p>&#8226; Historical accounts note that Ptolemy&#8217;s counter-attack cost the Seleucid side roughly ten to twelve thousand lives. The text uses broad language&#8212;&#8220;slaughter many thousands&#8221;&#8212;to stress the scale of bloodshed.<p>&#8226; Scripture elsewhere calls attention to mass casualties as sober reminders of sin&#8217;s ruin and the futility of man&#8217;s wars (<a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>).<p>&#8226; God is never the author of evil, yet He records these tragedies to warn, humble, and steer hearts toward His peace (<a href="/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet he will not remain triumphant</b><p>&#8226; Despite the resounding victory, Ptolemy gained no lasting strength. Within a few years his moral decay, heavy taxation, and internal unrest wiped out the advantage (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-13.htm">Daniel 11:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse confirms <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>&#8212;promotion and downfall come from the Lord alone.

The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s precise foreknowledge, exposes the emptiness of pride, and reinforces that genuine triumph belongs solely to the Lord who directs history toward His everlasting kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And when he.--</span>It is not clear whether "the multitude" or "the king" is subject of the sentence, or whether the verb "he hath taken away" is to be translated active or passive. The verse might mean, "And the multitude is lifted up--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> takes courage--and its heart is exalted," or, "when the multitude takes courage the king's heart is exalted." The English translation is most in accordance with the context, but the second rendering is preferred by many, according to which the king's courage and pride increase as he perceives the mightiness of his troops. The LXX. follow a different reading throughout the verse.<p><span class= "bld">And he shall cast down.--</span>These words describe the victory of the southern king after he has taken the "multitude" of the northern king.<p><span class= "bld">But he shall not be strengthened</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, he does not prove so successful as he had hoped. His aim was to gain complete supremacy over his rival, but for reasons which are about to be stated he was unable to gain his object. Those interpreters who see a distinct reference to the wars of Ptolemy and Antiochus point out that though the loss of the Syrians was very great, yet Ptolemy did not follow up his success as he should have done. Instead of striking a decisive blow, he was content with regaining the towns which Antiochus had taken from him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands; but he shall not be strengthened by it.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "And he shall take the levy (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall trouble many, and shall not be afraid." There seems to have been some difference of reading in the last clause, but it is not clear what. Theodotion renders the first clause as does the Septuagint; but the latter clause is more in accordance with the English version of the Massoretic text. The Peshitta from the same text differs in its interpretation, "And he shall destroy them mightily, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many, and shall not be strengthened." The Vulgate presents no occasion of remark. <span class="accented">And he shall cast down many ten thousands.</span> This, most probably, refers to the complete victory at Raphia, where Antiochus was reported to have lost ten thousand men. There is thus a repetition here of what has already been narrated. <span class="accented">But he shall not be strengthened by it.</span> It is very noticeable that Ptolemy did not even attempt to strengthen his position by vigorously following up his victory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the army</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1492;&#1464;&#1502;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;h&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1995.htm">Strong's 1995: </a> </span><span class="str2">A noise, tumult, crowd, disquietude, wealth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is carried off,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ni&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the king of the South] will be proud</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7311.htm">Strong's 7311: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be high actively, to rise, raise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3824.htm">Strong's 3824: </a> </span><span class="str2">Inner man, mind, will, heart</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and cast down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hip&#183;p&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tens of thousands,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(rib&#183;b&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7239.htm">Strong's 7239: </a> </span><span class="str2">A myriad, large number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but he will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">triumph.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1494;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wz)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5810.htm">Strong's 5810: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be strong</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/11-12.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 11:12 The multitude shall be lifted up (Dan.
