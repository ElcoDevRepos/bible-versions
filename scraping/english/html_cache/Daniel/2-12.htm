In the ancient Near Eastern context, dreams were often seen as messages from the divine, and the failure to interpret them could be perceived as a failure to connect with the divine realm. The intensity of the king's anger reflects the high stakes involved in dream interpretation in Babylonian culture, where kings relied heavily on their advisors for guidance and decision-making. This anger also sets the stage for Daniel's introduction as a key figure who can provide divine insight.<p><b>that he gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</b><br>The decree to destroy all the wise men highlights the absolute power of the king and the precarious position of the wise men in the Babylonian court. This drastic measure underscores the king's desperation and the perceived failure of the existing religious and intellectual systems. Historically, Babylon was known for its scholarly and religious institutions, and the wise men included astrologers, magicians, and enchanters. This order sets up a crisis that allows Daniel, a Hebrew exile, to demonstrate the superiority of his God over the Babylonian deities. It also foreshadows the deliverance theme prevalent in the Book of Daniel, where God intervenes to save His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream and demanded its interpretation from his wise men.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_men_of_babylon.htm">Wise Men of Babylon</a></b><br>A group of magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers who served the king by interpreting dreams and providing counsel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The capital city of the Babylonian Empire, known for its wealth, power, and influence in the ancient world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew captive in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams through God's revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_decree.htm">The King's Decree</a></b><br>The order given by Nebuchadnezzar to execute all the wise men of Babylon due to their inability to interpret his dream.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Affairs</a></b><br>The inability of the wise men to interpret the dream underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the supremacy of God's knowledge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_revelation.htm">The Role of Divine Revelation</a></b><br>True understanding and insight come from God, as seen in Daniel's later interpretation of the dream.

Though Daniel had been already trained in their schools, he had not as yet been appointed "a wise man." However, being a student, his death was implied in the general order, which, as appears from <a href="/daniel/2-13.htm" title="And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.">Daniel 2:13</a>, had already begun to be executed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon</span>. The Septuagint rendering differs little in sense from the above, but in words it does considerably, "Then the king, becoming gloomy and very grieved, commanded that they lead out all the wise men of Babylonia." The main thing to be observed is the softening of the meaning in the hands of the Septuagint translator. This is so great as to suggest that he read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. The aphel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> is not used in Chaldee, but is used in Syriac. Theodotion's rendering is, "Then the king in anger and wrath commanded to destroy all the wise meal of Babylon." The Syriac has a shade of difference, "Then was the king vehemently enraged, and in great fury commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon." It is evident that Theodotion read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">benas</span>), "was angry," as if it were the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> and the Syriac noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (has), "anger." He also must have inserted the preposition before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">qetzaph</span>), "wrath;" in this he is followed by the Peshitta. The Septuagint is freer in its rendering in this <span class="accented">verse</span>, and one cannot argue anything from it. The probability seems to be that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>; (<span class="accented">nas</span>) is used as a noun, and that the Targamic verb was formed from the mistake of a scribe dropping the preposition before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">qetzaph</span>). If we are correct in this, we have an additional evidence that the original languagge of Daniel was not Chaldee, but Syriac, or, at all events, Eastern Aramaic. As a grammatical note, we direct attention to the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> of the root has totally disappeared before the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> of the haphel, the equivalent in Biblical Aramaic of the Chaldee and Syriac aphel with its preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x20;</span>. Professor Bevan says that this distinction is only a matter of orthography. Are we to deduce that Professor Bevan has a cockney disregard for <span class="accented">h</span>s? The writer now drops reference to special classes of wise men, and names them generally <span class="accented">hakeemin.</span> The king is unconvinced of the truth of these wise men (<span class="accented">hakeemin</span>), or rather he is convinced that they are traitors and deceivers. They are either concealing from him the knowledge they have, and are, therefore, traitors to him; or the gods have withdrawn from them, and therefore they must have been untrue to the gods. On both these grounds Nebuchadnezzar thinks them worthy of death. He at once issues the decree that all the wise men in the city of Babylon should be slain. If the LXX. reading of <a href="/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a> be correct, he had only summoned the Chaldean wise men. If all the wise men of Babylon were ordered to be slain, the punishment is extended beyond the offence. Possibly he argued, "If even my fellow-countrymen, the Chaldeans, are traitors, much more will the Babylonians be so." So far as words go, it is doubtful whether this decree applies to the province of Babylonia, as the Septuagint translator thinks, or merely to those in the city. But cruel and furious as was the young conqueror, he was scarcely likely to order the wholesale massacre of those who, in Sippara and Borsippa, had neither refused to do what he wished, nor by implication called him an unreasonable tyrant, as had the wise men in Babylon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This [response] made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1459;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(qo&#183;&#7687;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6903.htm">Strong's 6903: </a> </span><span class="str2">In front of, before, because of, because that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;ag&#183;g&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7690.htm">Strong's 7690: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, much</span><br /><br /><span class="word">angry</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1430;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;nas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1149.htm">Strong's 1149: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be enraged</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and furious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#7779;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
