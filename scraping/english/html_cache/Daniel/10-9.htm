In the context of <a href="/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a>, the "his" refers to a heavenly messenger, possibly Gabriel, who is delivering a message to Daniel. The sound of the words suggests authority and power, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's voice is described as overwhelming, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. The auditory experience signifies the importance and divine origin of the message.<p><b>and as I listened</b><br>Daniel's attentive listening underscores his role as a prophet and servant of God, emphasizing the importance of being receptive to divine communication. This act of listening is a common theme in Scripture, where hearing God's word is crucial for understanding and obedience (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). It also reflects Daniel's humility and readiness to receive God's guidance, a characteristic seen throughout his life and ministry.<p><b>I fell into a deep sleep</b><br>The deep sleep signifies a state of being overwhelmed by the divine presence, often associated with receiving visions or revelations. This is similar to the experiences of other biblical figures, such as Abram in <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a> and Peter in <a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a>. The deep sleep can symbolize a transition from the natural to the supernatural realm, where God imparts wisdom and understanding beyond human comprehension.<p><b>with my face to the ground</b><br>This posture of humility and submission is common in biblical accounts of encounters with the divine. It reflects reverence and awe in the presence of God's holiness, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>. The act of falling with one's face to the ground is a physical manifestation of worship and acknowledgment of God's supreme authority. It also highlights the human response to the overwhelming glory and majesty of God, which is a recurring theme in prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of God who is receiving a vision.

Daniel&#8217;s experience lines up perfectly with that pattern, underscoring that the message he receives carries divine weight and cannot be dismissed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and as I listened</b><p>&#8226; Daniel chooses the posture of a listener rather than a speaker, mirroring Samuel&#8217;s &#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) and Mary sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39</a>).<p>&#8226; True listening in Scripture involves the heart as well as the ears (<a href="/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21-22</a>). Daniel demonstrates this readiness, preparing him to receive God&#8217;s revelation about epic spiritual conflict (vv. 12-14).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that God still expects His people to stop, listen, and receive before they act (<a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I fell into a deep sleep</b><p>&#8226; The phrase describes an overpowering, literal loss of strength and consciousness, similar to Abram&#8217;s experience when &#8220;a deep sleep fell upon Abram&#8221; as God cut covenant with him (<a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This deep sleep signals that what follows is entirely God&#8217;s doing; human effort is set aside (cf. <a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical collapse in the presence of the holy is a common biblical reaction (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). Daniel&#8217;s body simply cannot bear the unveiled glory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with my face to the ground</b><p>&#8226; Prostration is the instinctive human response to heavenly majesty (<a href="/matthew/17-6.htm">Matthew 17:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Face-down humility underscores Daniel&#8217;s reverence and the literal reality that he is overwhelmed by holiness, not merely awed in a figurative sense.<p>&#8226; This posture also anticipates the angel&#8217;s strengthening touch in v. 10, highlighting our dependence on divine enablement whenever God speaks (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a> portrays an unmistakably literal encounter: Daniel hears God&#8217;s thunderous words, listens attentively, collapses into a divinely induced sleep, and lies prostrate. Each detail&#8212;audible voice, deliberate listening, physical overpowering, face-down humility&#8212;underscores God&#8217;s absolute authority and the frailty of even the holiest human when heaven breaks through.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">His words.</span>--He refers to the unrecorded words of <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm" title="His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.">Daniel 10:6</a>. (Comp. <a href="/context/daniel/8-17.htm" title="So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.">Daniel 8:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</span> The Septuagint rendering here is briefer than the Massoretic, "And I heard the sound of his speech (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, ' talking'), and I was fallen upon my face upon the earth." The Septuagint translator seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">nephalti</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nir'dam</span>). Theodotion is somewhat nearer the Massoretic text, but renders <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by "stupefied." The Pesifitta is an accurate rendering of the text behind the Septuagint. Jerome agrees with Theodotion, rendering <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by <span class="accented">consternatus</span>; he strengthens the phrase, "my face toward the ground," by inserting <span class="accented">haerebat.</span> It would seem that <span class="accented">nirdam</span> is of doubtful authenticity. It may be said this was omitted because of the difficulty of imagining the prophet seeing while in a deep sleep. But a state of sleep does not preclude the possibility of seeing a vision. In the parallel passage (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>) the LXX. has no difficulty in translating, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. By assuming the reading of the LXX. and the Peshitta to be correct, we make the process of events more natural; according to the Massoretic reading, though we have an account of his sense of weakness, we have no record that he <span class="accented">fell</span> to the ground, and yet we are told that he was "in a deep sleep, with his face toward the ground" The resemblance is very great to <a href="/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, "A thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof in thoughts from the vision of the night, when sleep falleth on men (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)." If there has been imitation, the originality and beauty of the passage in Job render it certain that it is the original. It seems more likely to be a change introduced to bring the revelation to Daniel in line with other prophetic revelations. The attitude Daniel assumed was one which implied the deepest abasement - the envoy of the great king kisses the ground at the feet of the envoy of the King of kings. Even the revelation given while sleep had fallen on the subject of the revelation, seems paralleled with what took place at the Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>, "And Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep," yet it was when they were awaked that they saw the glory). So with Gethsemane. The Hebrew word is the same as that used when Eve was taken out of the side of Adam; he then was asleep - a deepsleep had fallen on him, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)."
