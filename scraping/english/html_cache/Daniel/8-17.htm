Gabriel is one of the few angels named in the Bible, indicating his importance. His role as a messenger is consistent with other appearances, such as in <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, where he announces the birth of John the Baptist. The approach signifies the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>I was terrified and fell facedown</b><br>Daniel's reaction is typical of encounters with divine beings, reflecting the overwhelming holiness and power of such beings. Similar reactions are seen in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, where individuals fall in awe and fear before divine manifestations. This response underscores the gravity of the vision and the message being conveyed.<p><b>&#8220;Son of man,&#8221; he said to me</b><br>The term "son of man" is used frequently in the book of Ezekiel and here in Daniel to emphasize the humanity of the prophet in contrast to the divine nature of the vision. It highlights Daniel's role as a representative of humanity receiving divine revelation. This term is also significant in the New Testament, where Jesus frequently uses it to refer to Himself, emphasizing His role as the representative and redeemer of humanity.<p><b>&#8220;understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates that the vision has eschatological significance, pointing to events that will occur in the future. The "time of the end" is a recurring theme in apocalyptic literature, including <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, where it refers to the culmination of God's plan for history.
