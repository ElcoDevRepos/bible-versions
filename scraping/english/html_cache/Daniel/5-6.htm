In the ancient Near Eastern culture, a change in facial color was often associated with terror or shock. The king's reaction reflects the gravity of the situation, as he witnesses the mysterious hand writing on the wall. This fear is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals encounter divine or supernatural events, such as the fear experienced by the guards at Jesus' tomb (<a href="/matthew/28-4.htm">Matthew 28:4</a>).<p><b>and his thoughts so alarmed him</b><br>The king's alarmed thoughts suggest a deep internal turmoil and confusion. In the context of <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>, Belshazzar is confronted with a divine message that he cannot understand, highlighting his vulnerability and the limits of his power. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of human rulers being subject to God's ultimate authority, as seen in Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>.<p><b>that his hips gave way</b><br>This phrase indicates a physical manifestation of fear, suggesting a loss of strength or control. In ancient texts, such expressions often symbolize a complete breakdown of composure. The imagery here underscores the king's helplessness in the face of divine judgment, similar to how the Philistines reacted with fear when the Ark of the Covenant was brought into their camp (<a href="/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10-12</a>).<p><b>and his knees knocked together</b><br>The knocking of knees is a vivid depiction of terror and physical weakness. This detail emphasizes the overwhelming nature of the king's fear. It serves as a reminder of the frailty of human power when confronted with the divine. This reaction can be compared to the fear and trembling described in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to work out their salvation with reverence and awe before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_belshazzar.htm">King Belshazzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who held a great feast and saw the mysterious handwriting on the wall, leading to his fear and trembling.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a powerful empire known for its wealth and idolatry, which was nearing its downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_handwriting_on_the_wall.htm">The Handwriting on the Wall</a></b><br>A divine message written by a mysterious hand during Belshazzar's feast, signifying God's judgment on Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who later interprets the writing for Belshazzar, revealing God's impending judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_feast.htm">The Feast</a></b><br>A lavish banquet hosted by Belshazzar, during which sacred vessels from the Jerusalem temple were profaned.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Belshazzar's arrogance and disrespect for God led to his downfall.

In this clause not improbably <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are double renderings of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. "And the king hasted and rose up, and looked at that writing, and his companions round about him (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) boasted." It is clear that the text from which the Septuagint had repeated the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">bebal</span>), which means originally "to hasten," and had the word "king "after it, if the Septuagint Aramaic were the original, we can easily understand how the word repeated might be omitted by <span class="accented">bomoioteleutoa.</span> While <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> could easily be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d8;</span> after the square character had got place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5de;</span> could not in the script of the Egyptian Aramaic papyri be easily read <span class="aramaic">&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span>. consequently we are inclined to look on the reading of the Septuagint here as being the primitive one. The king, according to this verse, saw the handwriting, but not till he rose did he see what was written. This representation of the succession of events is natural, whereas the statements about his loins being loosed is mere amplification. The last clause storms to be a misreading of the clause which appears in the Massoretic at the end (which see). The first word seems to have been misread <span class="accented">heberren</span>, and thus a meaning is violently given to the other parts of the clause. The probability is in favour of the Massoretic reading here, Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The omen of a hand appearing to write on the wall of the palace was one that might easily cause the thoughts of the king to trouble him. Much more was the omen of importance when the king saw that the hand which had appeared to write had actually left certain words written. It was but natural that the bright<span class="accented">ness</span> of the king's countenance should depart from him when he saw the hand. thus awfully coming out of the darkness, and writing, and that his knees should smite one upon another when what was written gleamed upon him from the wall before him. He might well be sure that the message so communicated would be laden with fate. Fear is naturally the first emotion occasioned by any mysterious occurrence; and then Babylon was, in all likelihood, being pressed by the advance of Cyrus. If he had any suspicion of the treachery that had sapped the power of his father, his apprehensions would be all the greater. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">his face</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1493;&#1466;&#1443;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(zi&#183;y&#333;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
