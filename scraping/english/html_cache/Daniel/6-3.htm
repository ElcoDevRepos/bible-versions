This phrase highlights the divine favor and spiritual gifts bestowed upon Daniel, which set him apart. His spirit is reminiscent of Joseph's in <a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>, where Pharaoh recognizes the Spirit of God in him. Daniel's ability to interpret dreams and visions, as seen in earlier chapters, further exemplifies this extraordinary spirit.<p><b>Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps</b><br>Daniel's distinction among the leaders of the Medo-Persian Empire underscores his competence and reliability. Administrators and satraps were high-ranking officials responsible for governance and tax collection. Daniel's rise in this context reflects God's providence and parallels Joseph's rise in Egypt. His integrity and work ethic serve as a model for believers, emphasizing the importance of living out one's faith in secular environments.<p><b>So the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom</b><br>The king's intention to elevate Daniel to a position of authority over the entire kingdom demonstrates the trust and confidence he had in Daniel's abilities. This mirrors the biblical theme of God exalting the humble, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> and <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>. Daniel's potential promotion foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, who will rule with justice and righteousness.

Almost immediately after the Medo-Persian takeover (<a href="/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1-2</a>), his reputation began to rise. God has a history of moving His people into place &#8220;at once&#8221; when they walk with Him&#8212;Joseph rose quickly in Potiphar&#8217;s house (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-4</a>), David found favor wherever Saul sent him (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>), and Esther gained royal favor in a single night (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>). The swiftness here reminds us that God can accelerate influence when faithfulness is already in place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By his extraordinary spirit</b><p>The phrase points to the God-given excellence that marked Daniel&#8217;s life. Similar language was used of him earlier: &#8220;an excellent spirit, knowledge, and insight&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/5-12.htm">Daniel 5:12</a>). Scripture links such excellence to the Holy Spirit&#8217;s work: Bezalel was &#8220;filled&#8230;with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, and ability&#8221; for the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>). Joseph&#8217;s discernment sprang from &#8220;the Spirit of God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>). When believers yield to God, He supplies what elevates them above mere human ability (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Daniel distinguished himself</b><p>He didn&#8217;t blend in; he stood out. That distinction came through integrity (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4</a>), prayer (6:10), and consistency (6:16, 23). Jesus calls His followers to the same visibility: &#8220;Let your light shine before men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). Paul urges excellence &#8220;as unto the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). Peter says our conduct should cause onlookers to glorify God (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>). Daniel models how open devotion to God doesn&#8217;t hinder vocational success&#8212;it enhances it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Among the administrators and satraps</b><p>Daniel&#8217;s peers were seasoned Persian officials, yet the exile from Judah surpassed them. <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> explains why: &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings.&#8221; Faithfulness in exile echoes Joseph serving Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>) and Mordecai in Persia (<a href="/esther/10-2.htm">Esther 10:2-3</a>). God can place His servants in any government, culture, or century and still make them fruitful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the king planned</b><p>King Darius noticed Daniel&#8217;s reliability and &#8220;intended&#8221; to promote him. God often uses the observations of secular leaders to advance His people (<a href="/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/acts/7-10.htm">Acts 7:10</a>). While adversaries plot harm (<a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-5</a>), the Lord turns hearts in favor of His own (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To set him over the whole kingdom</b><p>The proposed elevation mirrors Joseph becoming second to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>) and Daniel&#8217;s earlier promotion by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>). Such authority fulfilled God&#8217;s promise to bless Israel and make them a blessing wherever they went (<a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>). It also foreshadows Christ&#8217;s ultimate reign, when &#8220;the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). For believers, Jesus affirms the principle: &#8220;You have been faithful&#8230; I will put you in charge of many things&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a> highlights God-given excellence that quickly sets His servant apart, wins the trust of earthly authorities, and positions him for significant influence.
