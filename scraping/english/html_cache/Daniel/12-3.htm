In biblical context, wisdom is frequently associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and the ability to discern God's will. The imagery of shining like the brightness of the heavens suggests a divine radiance and purity, reminiscent of the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>) and the glorified state of believers (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>). The heavens, often seen as the realm of God, symbolize the ultimate reward and recognition of the wise in the eschatological future.<p><b>and those who lead many to righteousness</b><br>This part highlights the role of believers in guiding others towards a righteous life, which is in alignment with God's standards. The concept of leading others to righteousness is akin to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations. Historically, this reflects the mission of the Jewish people to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). The emphasis on "many" indicates the expansive impact of their witness and teaching, suggesting a communal and evangelistic responsibility.<p><b>will shine like the stars forever and ever</b><br>The comparison to stars signifies eternal glory and honor. Stars, in ancient Near Eastern culture, were often seen as symbols of permanence and guidance. This eternal aspect is reinforced by the phrase "forever and ever," indicating an unending reward. The imagery of stars also connects to the promise given to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), symbolizing the fulfillment of God's covenant. In a prophetic sense, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "bright Morning Star" (<a href="/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>), and the ultimate source of righteousness and light.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his unwavering faith and prophetic visions.

Wisdom here is spiritual discernment that clings to God through trials, trusting His Word even in persecution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will shine like the brightness of the heavens</b><p>&#8226; God promises visible, radiant glory for His faithful people. The language parallels Jesus&#8217; own words: &#8220;Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The brightness of the heavens recalls the clear, dazzling sky&#8212;an image of purity and victory (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). This glory is not metaphorical only; at resurrection believers will bear glorious bodies (<a href="/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who lead many to righteousness</b><p>&#8226; Daniel widens the focus from personal faithfulness to active influence.

Such is the consolation held out for the support of those who shall witness the tribulation of the last days. (See Notes on Matthew 24 and the parallel passages.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</span> The rendering of the LXX. differs from this considerably, "Those who understand shall appear as the lights of heaven, and those that confirm my word as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." There seems to be a difference of reading in the first clause. Instead of <span class="accented">yazheeroo kezohar</span>, there seems to have been <span class="accented">yayraro kim'ooroth.</span> The verb used in the Massoretic text means really "admonish." The noun occurs only in <a href="/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>. In the last clause, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harabbeem</span>), "many," the Septuagint has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">deboray</span>), "my words." It is difficult to account for the omission of the final <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">unless</span> from the likeness of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and and (see Corpus Insc. Semit.). Theodotion renders, "And they that understand shall shine as the <span class="accented">brightness</span> of the firmament, and certain from amongst the righteous as the stars for ever and ever." The Peshitta rendering is somewhat paraphrastic, "Those that do good and are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who conquer many shall be lights, and arise as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." The Vulgate is in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The versions are superior to our Authorized, in having "those that understand" instead of "those that be wise." Bevan regards the wise here as the "teachers." There seems, however, no reason for such a restriction. The reading of the Septuagint in the opening clause of the second member of the sentence is inferior, as confirming or justifying the words of Daniel or of God is a simpler idea than that of turning many to righteousness. Further, there is a difficulty of fixing who is referred to by the prenominal suffix "my." Professor Fuller refers to <a href="/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> for a parallel use of the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; but there, as elsewhere, it means, not "turn to righteousness," but "justify," that is, "declare righteous." Yet the connection between the two ideas is close, and the forensic idea can have no place here. <a href="/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a> represents a similar reward to the righteous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1448;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;ma&#347;&#183;ki&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
