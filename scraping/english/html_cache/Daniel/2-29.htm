The king's bed symbolizes a place of rest and contemplation, where significant revelations often occur in biblical narratives. In ancient Near Eastern culture, dreams were considered a medium through which the divine communicated with humans, especially rulers. This setting emphasizes the personal and direct nature of the divine message.<p><b>your thoughts turned to the future,</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's thoughts about the future reflect the concerns of a ruler over the stability and longevity of his kingdom. In the context of the Babylonian Empire, which was known for its grandeur and power, the king's contemplation of the future underscores the transient nature of earthly kingdoms. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>, which speaks to the human desire to understand the future and the divine plan.<p><b>and the Revealer of Mysteries</b><br>This title for God highlights His omniscience and sovereignty. The term "Revealer of Mysteries" is significant in the context of the book of Daniel, where God is shown to have ultimate authority over human affairs and the unfolding of history. This concept is reinforced in other parts of Daniel, such as <a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges God's power. It also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate revelation of God's mysteries (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).<p><b>made known to you</b><br>The act of making known signifies divine revelation, a key theme in biblical prophecy. This phrase indicates that the understanding of future events is not achieved through human wisdom but through God's intervention. It parallels the role of prophets throughout the Bible, who serve as conduits for God's messages, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>what will happen.</b><br>This phrase points to the prophetic nature of the dream, which outlines the succession of world empires and the eventual establishment of God's eternal kingdom. The prophecy in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a> is foundational for understanding the biblical view of history and eschatology. It foreshadows the coming of Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of our Lord.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that none of his wise men could interpret, leading to Daniel's involvement.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and wise man in the Babylonian court, known for his ability to interpret dreams and visions through divine revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and as a center of power and culture in the ancient world.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_revealer_of_mysteries.htm">The Revealer of Mysteries</a></b><br>Refers to God, who is acknowledged by Daniel as the source of all wisdom and the one who reveals hidden things.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, which Daniel interprets, revealing future kingdoms and God's ultimate sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_history.htm">God's Sovereignty Over History</a></b><br>God is in control of future events and reveals His plans according to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_divine_revelation.htm">The Role of Divine Revelation</a></b><br>True wisdom and understanding come from God, who reveals mysteries to those who seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_exile.htm">Faithfulness in Exile</a></b><br>Like Daniel, believers are called to remain faithful and trust in God's wisdom, even in challenging circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer_and_dependence_on_god.htm">The Importance of Prayer and Dependence on God</a></b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream was rooted in prayer and reliance on God, emphasizing the need for a prayerful life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_plan_for_the_future.htm">God's Plan for the Future</a></b><br>The dream points to God's overarching plan for history, encouraging believers to trust in His ultimate purpose.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_2_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 2:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_2_29_God_s_control_over_thoughts.htm">How does Daniel 2:29 demonstrate God's sovereignty over human thoughts and plans?

This invites trust in His sovereign plan, confidence in the literal truth of Scripture, and readiness to align our lives with the coming, unshakable kingdom of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Hereafter</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in the course of history, not only in the Messianic days.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="accented">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind m on thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass</span>. This verse is of somewhat suspicious authenticity, the renderings of the different versions show such a diversity of text. The Septuagint rendering is very brief, being merely a version of the last clause, "He that revealeth secrets (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) showed that which behoveth to be." This has the appearance as if the translators here rendered the last word as an infinitive, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as not the preformatvre of the third person future, but as the sign of the infinitive. It is not necessarily so, because it may be that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>' is regarded as included in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lehave</span>). Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic, "O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed raised up what behoved to be after these things; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what behoveth to be." The Peshitta renders slightly differently, Thou, O king, thy thoughts arose in thy heart on account of what should be in the latter days, and he that revealeth secrets made known to thee what shall be." Even Jerome, who is usually pretty close to the Massoretic text, differs a little here. "Thou, O king, didst begin to think upon thy couch what would be after these things; and he who reveal-eth mysteries showeth thee what shall be." Paulus Tellensis has broken away from the Septuagint, supplying the clause omitted, not improbably from Theodotion, "Thou, O king, when. thou layest upon thy couch, sawest all things which behoved to happen in the last days; and he who revealeth secrets hath showed to thee what behoved to be." Altogether, with the exception of the last clause, which is evidenced by all the versions, we doubt the authenticity of this verse. However, the interpolation, if we have a case of it here, must have been of old date, as is indicated by the archaic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">an'tah</span>), which becomes in the Q'ri <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">an't</span>). Whether an interpolation or part of the original text, the picture suggested is very natural. The young conqueror, who had already secured the whole of South-Western Asia to the river of Egypt, was occupying his thoughts in speculating what should come after him.
