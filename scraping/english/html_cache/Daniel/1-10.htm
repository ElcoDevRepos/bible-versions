Daniel, a young Hebrew captive, is in Babylon under King Nebuchadnezzar's rule. The interaction highlights Daniel's respectful approach and the official's concern, setting the stage for the test of faith and obedience to God's laws.<p><b>&#8220;I fear my lord the king,</b><br>Ashpenaz expresses his fear of King Nebuchadnezzar, known for his absolute power and harsh punishments. This fear reflects the political climate of Babylon, where the king's word was law, and disobedience could lead to severe consequences. The king's authority is a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel, illustrating the tension between earthly power and divine authority.<p><b>who has assigned your food and drink.</b><br>The king's provision of food and drink was intended to assimilate the captives into Babylonian culture, including dietary practices contrary to Jewish law. This phrase underscores the challenge faced by Daniel and his friends to maintain their religious identity in a foreign land. The dietary laws in Leviticus and Deuteronomy emphasize purity and obedience to God, which Daniel seeks to uphold.<p><b>For why should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other young men your age?</b><br>Ashpenaz is concerned about the physical appearance of Daniel and his friends, which was a measure of their health and suitability for service in the king's court. This concern reflects the Babylonian emphasis on physical appearance and capability. The phrase also foreshadows the miraculous outcome of Daniel's faithfulness, as God honors their commitment by keeping them healthy.<p><b>You would endanger my head before the king!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase highlights the personal risk Ashpenaz faces if he disobeys the king's orders. In ancient Near Eastern courts, failure to comply with royal decrees could result in execution. This statement underscores the high stakes involved in Daniel's request and the courage required to stand firm in faith. It also sets the stage for God's intervention, demonstrating His sovereignty and protection over those who trust Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man taken into Babylonian captivity, known for his faithfulness to God and his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_official.htm">The Official (Chief of the Eunuchs)</a></b><br>The Babylonian official responsible for overseeing the young captives, including Daniel, and ensuring they adhere to the king's orders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Nebuchadnezzar)</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who ordered the training and assimilation of the young Hebrew captives.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and his friends were taken captive, known for its wealth, power, and pagan practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king's_food_and_drink.htm">The King's Food and Drink</a></b><br>The royal provisions assigned to Daniel and his friends, which they sought to avoid to remain faithful to their dietary laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_man_vs._fear_of_god.htm">Fear of Man vs. Fear of God</a></b><br>The official's fear of the king contrasts with Daniel's fear of God.

The chief official, captivated by Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s authority, hesitates to grant Daniel&#8217;s request. He worries about visible health decline and the lethal consequences of displeasing the king. Yet this very obstacle sets the stage for God to vindicate faithfulness. Daniel&#8217;s respectful persistence, matched with unwavering conviction, will soon demonstrate that obedience to God never truly endangers life; rather, it secures His blessing and showcases His power before a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Of your sort,</span> <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of your contemporaries, those who are of the same age with you.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</span> In the Hebrew of this verse there are traces that it has been translated from an Aramaic original.

The word (<span class="accented">sar</span>) for "prince" is continued from the preceding verse, <span class="accented">I fear.</span> In the Massoretic text, the word is not a verb, but an adjective. If the phrase were rendered "I am afraid," this would represent the construction, it is one that is specially frequent with this adjective; it resembles the construction so common in Aramaic of participle with pronoun where an ordinary preterite or imperfect would be used in Hebrew. <span class="accented">Your meat and your drink.</span> In this phrase the enigmatic word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> has disappeared; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">ma'achal</span>), the ordinary word for "food," has replaced it. <span class="accented">For why should he see your face.</span> The construction here is decidedly Aramaic, and resembles a word-for-word rendering from an Aramaic original.

It is to be noted that the Septuagint here has two renderings, probably a case of "doublet." The first <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> may refer to the mental confusion or sadness that they might be in if on account of their poor nourishment they were unable to answer the king's questions; the second, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>, "weak," may refer to the body: <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> Theodotion's rendering, which may be rendered "scowling" (it is used along with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Plato, 'Syrup.'). The Peshitta has <span class="accented">m'karan</span>, "ashamed;" that they would feel shame were they much inferior in looks or acquirements to their neighbours would be natural. The intimate connection between food and good looks and good mental qualities is well known as one much held, especially in ancient days. <span class="accented">Than the children of your sort. Keqilkem</span>; this word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span>, is maintained by Professor Bevan to be unused in early Hebrew in the sense of "generation" or "age" Furst would regard the name Abigail as exhibiting the word as existing in early times. The only difficulty in this is that the name may have another derivation. The real meaning of the word in this connection is "a circle;" hence then a revolution of the heavens. It is explained by Buxtorf as meaning "constellation, planet;" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "son of his star" - born under the same constellation, contemporary. The Syriac paraphrases the word, and renders "of your year." Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, "of like age." When we turn to the Septuagint, we find evidence either that the word was not there at all, or that it was misunderstood; the Septuagint rendering is "than the stranger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) youths brought up with you (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>)." This is an evident case of doublet. The first that stands in the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: this represents a various reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">gad'lu itkem</span>), by no means an impossible reading. The other, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geereem</span>): this is still more like the Massoretic reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geelkem</span>). The Massoretic is possibly the reading from which the other two have sprung; if so, it is clear that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> has not in this sense been known to either of the two Egyptian translators. It is not Targumic, for Levy has it not in his Lexicon. Professor Bevan says it is Aramaic and Arabic. This, then, is a case where the Aramaic original shines through; the chief of the eunuchs would naturally speak in Aramaic. <span class="accented">Then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</span> Here again is a word which Professor Bevan declares is late, the word here translated "make me endanger <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">yehigyabetem</span>)." There is no difficulty as to the reading in the versions, save that the Septuagint reads the first person singular instead of the second person plural, in other words, <span class="accented">vehiyyabti</span>, "and I shall endanger," and "my neck," reading, instead of "my head," possibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tzavvari</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">maphraqti</span>), the latter reading due to the <span class="accented">mere</span>, the sign of the second person plural being transferred to the following word. It may certainly have been a paraphrase, but the phrase as it stands in the Massoretic seems awkward. <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan brings forward this word as Aramaic, and a proof of the lateness of Daniel. If we are correct, it is a case where the Aramaic of the original shines through. The word indubitably occurs in <a href="/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>. As counsel for the prosecution, Professor Bevan must get rid of this awkward fact. Cornill, one of his colleagues in the case against Daniel, suggests that another word should be read in Ezekiel, and <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan agrees, but differs as to the word. There is no indication in any of the versions that there is any uncertainty as to the reading in Ezekiel. It is a most convenient method of getting rid of an awkward fact; little extension of it might make any word one pleased a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon.</span> The critics might have tried the method more reasonably on Daniel than on Ezekiel; but as their brief was against Daniel, that did not occur to them. The picture presented to us in this verse is one that in the <span class="accented">circumstances</span> is full of naturalness. We have, on the one hand, the eager entreaty of the Hebrew youth; the kindly look of the prince, willing to grant anything he possibly can to his favourite, yet hindered by fear for himself, and at the same time a desire that Daniel, his favourite, should stand well with the king. The chief of the eunuchs knew that personal good looks were an important matter with Nebuchadnezzar. If they were badly nourished, these Hebrew youths would be handicapped in their examination before the king. But more, shame at their own appearance would disturb them mentally, even if they were able to study as well on this plain food they desired. If the failure were egregious, then investigation might be demanded, and then the fact that he had transgressed the orders of the king would be a serious offence - the king knew no mercy when enraged. It is to be observed that the chief of the eunuchs first appeals to the self-interest of the youths before him, that they would endanger their own prospects; but as that does not move them, he next tells them that his own life would be endangered. In this case we must remember we have merely a summary, and a very condensed summary, of what was probably a prolonged argument. We have only the heads, and probably the succession of the arguments. It may, perhaps, be regarded as a proof of the authenticity of this speech that two Aramaic words are preserved in it. The Rabsaris most certainly would speak in Aramaic, and technical words such as <span class="accented">geel</span> and <span class="accented">heyyabtem</span> might be retained even in a translation, if there were no word which was quite an exact equivalent. Thus in translations from French or German into English, how frequently are words transferred from the original tongue[ "One-sided" is a case in point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8269.htm">Strong's 8269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chieftain, chief, ruler, official, captain, prince</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1436;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
