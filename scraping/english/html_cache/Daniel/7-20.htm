This imagery of horns as symbols of power and authority is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>, where horns also symbolize kings. The number ten may signify completeness or a full set of rulers within this empire.<p><b>and the other horn that came up</b><br>This other horn is often identified as a future ruler or power that emerges after the initial ten. In prophetic literature, such as in Daniel and Revelation, horns often symbolize leaders or kingdoms. This horn's emergence suggests a shift in power dynamics, indicating a new, significant force that disrupts the established order.<p><b>before which three of them fell</b><br>The phrase indicates that three of the original ten horns (kings or kingdoms) are subdued or overthrown by the new horn. This suggests a consolidation of power and a significant change in the political landscape. Historically, this could be seen as a reference to the rise of a dominant leader who eliminates rivals to establish control.<p><b>the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others</b><br>This horn is described as more imposing, indicating its greater power or influence compared to the others. This could symbolize a particularly charismatic or forceful leader. The imposing nature of this horn suggests it has a significant impact on the world stage, aligning with descriptions of the Antichrist in eschatological interpretations.<p><b>with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words of arrogance</b><br>The eyes suggest intelligence or insight, while the mouth speaking arrogantly indicates blasphemy or prideful declarations against God. This description aligns with the characteristics of the "man of lawlessness" in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>, who exalts himself above all that is called God. The imagery underscores the horn's defiance and opposition to divine authority, a common theme in apocalyptic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The phrase signals that the details he is about to ask for are important for God&#8217;s people to grasp (cf. <a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>, where prophets eagerly examine their own visions).<p>&#8226; It encourages believers to pursue understanding rather than settle for vague impressions (see <a href="/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about the ten horns on its head</b><p>Daniel zeroes in on the &#8220;ten horns&#8221;

The number ten suggests a complete but limited confederation, simultaneous in existence.<p>&#8226; Because the beast matches the final, iron-like phase of human empire (<a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>; cf. <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1-2</a>), many view these ten kings as a future alliance that revives aspects of the old Roman Empire.<p>&#8226; God permits their rise yet keeps them under His sovereign timetable (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the other horn that came up</b><p>Daniel then asks about &#8220;the other horn that came up.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This &#8220;other&#8221; or &#8220;little&#8221; horn (<a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>) appears after the ten are already in place&#8212;an eleventh ruler erupting suddenly from within the confederation.<p>&#8226; He is consistently linked with the final antichrist figure (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His ascent fulfills the pattern of previous antichrist previews&#8212;e.g., Antiochus IV in <a href="/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9-11</a>&#8212;but on a global end-time scale (<a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal emergence of one dominating leader underscores that prophecy points to concrete historical events, not mere symbolism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before which three of them fell</b><p>Daniel observes that &#8220;three of them fell&#8221; before the newcomer.<p>&#8226; The little horn forcibly removes or subdues three of the original ten kings (<a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This act highlights his aggressive consolidation of power&#8212;an unmistakable political upheaval, not mere influence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a> presents a similar picture of kings turning against one another under satanic manipulation, further confirming literal geopolitical conflict at the end of the age.<p>&#8226; God allows this temporary triumph so that His final judgment will be unmistakably righteous when it comes (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others</b><p>Daniel notes the little horn&#8217;s &#8220;more imposing&#8221; look.<p>&#8226; His dominance is visible&#8212;whether through military might, charismatic authority, or supernatural backing (<a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; This unnerving stature fulfills earlier warnings of a blasphemous ruler &#8220;exalting himself above every god&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers are alerted not to be swayed by impressive outward power (<a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with eyes and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance</b><p>Finally, Daniel focuses on the horn&#8217;s &#8220;eyes&#8221;

The &#8220;mouth that spoke words of arrogance&#8221; signals his hallmark: boastful, blasphemous claims against God (<a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; His speech mirrors the serpent&#8217;s ancient lie, seeking to elevate man above the Creator (<a href="/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God limits the duration of these boasts to &#8220;a time, times, and half a time&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>), assuring believers that evil&#8217;s loudest hour is also its briefest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-20.htm">Daniel 7:20</a> provides a snapshot of the last world power bloc&#8212;ten contemporaneous kings&#8212;out of which a singular, blasphemous ruler rises, toppling three, dazzling the world with commanding presence, keen insight, and arrogant speech. The verse underscores God&#8217;s foreknowledge and sovereignty over end-time events, encourages believers to seek understanding, and prepares them to stand firm when political brilliance and spiritual deception converge in the person Scripture later calls the antichrist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I also wanted to know about</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
