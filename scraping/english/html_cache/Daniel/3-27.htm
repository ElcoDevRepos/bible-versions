The satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers were key figures in the administration of the vast Babylonian Empire, reflecting the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern governance. Their gathering underscores the importance of the event and the widespread witness to God's power. This assembly of officials also mirrors the earlier gathering in <a href="/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar summoned them to the dedication of the golden image, setting the stage for the dramatic demonstration of God's sovereignty over earthly powers.<p><b>they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men</b><br>The miraculous preservation of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego is a testament to divine intervention. In the ancient world, fire was often seen as a purifying and destructive force, yet here it is rendered powerless. This event echoes other biblical instances where God protects His people, such as the Israelites crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and Daniel in the lions' den (Daniel 6). The phrase underscores the theme of God's protection and deliverance, reinforcing the message that faithfulness to God results in His supernatural protection.<p><b>Not a hair of their heads was singed</b><br>This detail emphasizes the completeness of the miracle. In the Bible, hair often symbolizes strength and vitality, as seen in the story of Samson (Judges 16). The preservation of even the smallest detail of their bodies highlights God's meticulous care and the totality of His protection. It also serves as a contrast to the fate of the soldiers who perished while throwing them into the furnace (<a href="/daniel/3-22.htm">Daniel 3:22</a>), further illustrating the miraculous nature of their deliverance.<p><b>their robes were unaffected</b><br>The mention of their robes being unaffected signifies the preservation of their identity and status. In ancient cultures, clothing was a significant indicator of one's role and position. The fact that their garments were untouched by the fire symbolizes the protection of their dignity and the maintenance of their witness to God's power. This detail also connects to the broader biblical theme of God clothing His people, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a> and <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where clothing represents God's provision and righteousness.<p><b>and there was no smell of fire on them</b><br>The absence of the smell of fire is a final testament to the thoroughness of the miracle. In the ancient world, the smell of fire would have been an unavoidable consequence of being near flames, yet God&#8217;s intervention is so complete that even this is prevented. This detail serves to underscore the totality of God's deliverance and the complete protection He offers to those who trust in Him. It also prefigures the New Testament promise of believers being preserved through trials (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>), highlighting the enduring nature of God's protection and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shadrach,_meshach,_and_abednego.htm">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</a></b><br>- Three Jewish men who were taken into Babylonian captivity and served in the court of King Nebuchadnezzar.

We can, however, at this point compare the list of officials with that which we find in the beginning of this chapter, in vers. 2 and 3. We find that the word <span class="accented">haddabereen</span> occupies the same place in the list as <span class="accented">gedabreen</span>, translated "treasurer," from which one might be inclined to think that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> had taken the place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span>, not an impossible change. The probability rather is that the word is to be regarded as collective, equivalent to "officials of the court," to save the repetition of the remaining classes Whether or not these officials had seen the companion the three witnesses for the truth had with them in the furnace, they, at all events, were now able to bear testimony to the fact that the three friends had escaped, and "had quenched the violence of the fire" (<a href="/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>). This event was all the more important to the Babylonians as to them fire was a god high in the pantheon<span class="cmt_word">.</span> The God of Israel was thus manifested as so much greater than Iz-bar, that he could deliver his servants even when in the very element in which Iz-bar had his power. The fact that even their "coats" - whatever these garments were - were not burned, and not even a hair singed, while the cords that had been used to bind them were consumed, emphasizes their deliverance, and shows it to be the work of a higher power, who could discriminate and limit the deliverance. The cords were consumed, but the garments of his servants were preserved even from the smell of fire. The Babylonians had conquered the city of Jehovah, had burned his temple, and had done this through the power of Marduk, so they thought; but here Bel-Marduk had been openly defied by three worshippers of Jehovah. They had been hurled into the very element of Iz-bar, the servant and ally of Marduk, yet fire had been unable to harm them or vindicate the honour of Bel-Marduk. What emphasized this was that the fire that spared the servants of Jehovah slew the votaries of Bel-Marduk, who were eager to show their reverence for Marduk by carrying these Jehovah-worshippers to the furnace. Such a miracle, so wrought before all the high dignitaries of the Babylonian Empire, would go far to take the edge off any taunting reference to the weakness of Jehovah's Godhead as demonstrated by the ruins of Jerusalem. Jehovah had shown himself as the supreme Revealer of secrets when he enabled Daniel to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream. He now manifested himself as Master of the most powerful of elements - fire. The Jews could thus maintain their faith unchallenged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and when the satraps,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;a&#353;&#183;dar&#183;p&#601;&#183;nay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_324.htm">Strong's 324: </a> </span><span class="str2">A satrap, governor, of a, main province</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prefects,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(si&#7713;&#183;nay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5460.htm">Strong's 5460: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prefect of a, province</span><br /><br /><span class="word">governors,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1488;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;w&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
