Iron, a strong and durable metal, symbolizes the empire's ability to crush and dominate. Historically, Rome was unparalleled in its expansion and influence, controlling vast territories across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The use of iron also reflects the technological advancements of the time, as iron was a key material in weaponry and infrastructure. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of empires and their rise and fall, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Revelation.<p><b>and its feet were part iron and part clay</b><br>The mixture of iron and clay in the feet signifies a divided kingdom, both strong and brittle. This part of the statue represents the later stages of the Roman Empire, which became fragmented and weakened over time. The clay, a weaker material, suggests instability and the inability to maintain cohesion. This division is historically evident in the eventual split of the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western regions. Biblically, this imagery foreshadows the eventual decline of human kingdoms and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom, as prophesied later in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>. The combination of iron and clay also serves as a metaphor for the blending of strong and weak elements, reflecting the challenges of unity and governance in diverse societies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and the main character in the Book of Daniel, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who had the dream of the statue, which Daniel interprets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, representing the head of gold in the statue.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_statue.htm">The Statue</a></b><br>A symbolic image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, representing successive world empires.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A divine revelation given to Nebuchadnezzar, interpreted by Daniel, revealing the future of world kingdoms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fragility_of_human_kingdoms.htm">The Fragility of Human Kingdoms</a></b><br>The mixture of iron and clay in the statue's feet symbolizes the inherent weakness and instability of earthly powers.

Daniel later identifies it: &#8220;There will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>). History confirms this in the rise of Rome, whose military power and legal system dominated the Mediterranean world (<a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Iron smashes and reshapes other metals (<a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a>), mirroring Rome&#8217;s habit of absorbing cultures yet imposing its own order (<a href="/john/19-10.htm">John 19:10-11</a>, <a href="/acts/25-10.htm">Acts 25:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The vision affirms God&#8217;s foreknowledge: centuries before Rome existed as an empire, Scripture forecast its character with perfect precision (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The unbroken legs also remind us that every earthly power, no matter how formidable, fits inside God&#8217;s sovereign plan (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Feet part iron and part clay</b><p>&#8220;and its feet were part iron and part clay&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33</a>)<p>&#8226; The shift from solid iron to a mixture signals a later, divided stage of the same imperial legacy: iron strength remains, but clay introduces weakness (<a href="/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41-42</a>).<p>&#8211; Iron: lingering military or technological might.<p>&#8211; Clay: human fragility, disunity, and moral brittleness (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Ten toes (<a href="/daniel/2-42.htm">Daniel 2:42</a>) align with &#8220;ten kings&#8221; who arise together at the end of the age (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-14</a>). Their loose alliance lacks the cohesive force Rome once had; they &#8220;will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-43.htm">Daniel 2:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The combination pictures a final geopolitical landscape&#8212;powerful yet inherently unstable&#8212;setting the stage for Christ&#8217;s return when &#8220;the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, cf. <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33</a> sketches two successive phases of the fourth kingdom: the iron legs foretell the Roman Empire&#8217;s unstoppable strength, while the mixed iron-and-clay feet foreshadow a future confederation inheriting Rome&#8217;s authority yet riddled with internal weakness. Both details underscore God&#8217;s precise control over history and point forward to the unshakable reign of Christ that will crush every human empire and stand forever.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">its legs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8243.htm">Strong's 8243: </a> </span><span class="str2">(lower) leg</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were iron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;zel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6523.htm">Strong's 6523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iron</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and its feet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1429;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7713;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7271.htm">Strong's 7271: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foot, a step, the pudenda</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were part</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#601;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4481.htm">Strong's 4481: </a> </span><span class="str2">From, out of, by, by reason of, at, more than</span><br /><br /><span class="word">iron</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1494;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;ar&#183;zel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6523.htm">Strong's 6523: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iron</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and part</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;n&#601;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Preposition &#124; third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">clay.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1505;&#1463;&#1469;&#1507;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;sap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2635.htm">Strong's 2635: </a> </span><span class="str2">Clay, potsherd</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/2-33.htm">Daniel 2:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/2-33.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 2:33 Its legs of iron its feet part (Dan.
