The use of "O Lord" signifies reverence and submission, while "our God" emphasizes the covenant relationship established with Israel. This reflects the intimate connection seen throughout the Old Testament, where God is often referred to as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand</b><br>This recalls the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The "mighty hand" symbolizes God's power and intervention in human affairs. This event is frequently referenced in the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's faithfulness and ability to save, serving as a type of Christ's redemptive work in the New Testament.<p><b>and who made for Yourself a name renowned to this day</b><br>The deliverance from Egypt established God's reputation among the nations as a powerful and faithful deity. This renown is not just historical but continues "to this day," indicating the enduring nature of God's glory and the lasting impact of His actions. This echoes the idea that God's works are meant to reveal His character and draw people to Him.<p><b>we have sinned; we have acted wickedly</b><br>This confession acknowledges the failure of the Israelites to uphold their covenant with God. The dual admission of sin and wickedness highlights the seriousness of their transgressions. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of human sinfulness and the need for repentance, which is central to the message of the prophets and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian and Persian exiles, known for his faithfulness to God and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who delivered His people from Egypt and is addressed by Daniel in his prayer of confession and supplication.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus_from_egypt.htm">The Exodus from Egypt</a></b><br>A pivotal event in Israel's history where God delivered the Israelites from slavery, demonstrating His power and establishing His name among the nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are in exile due to their disobedience and sin, which Daniel acknowledges in his prayer.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The context of Daniel's prayer, where the Israelites are in captivity as a consequence of their rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_god's_past_deliverance.htm">Recognition of God's Past Deliverance</a></b><br>Reflect on how God has delivered you in the past.

The phrase &#8220;our God&#8221; links Daniel with his people, underscoring corporate identity and responsibility.<p>&#8226; Speaking directly to God acknowledges His sovereignty, the same sovereignty celebrated in passages like <a href="/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>: &#8220;Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand,</b><p>&#8226; Daniel recalls the historic, literal Exodus&#8212;proof that God intervenes powerfully in real history (<a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By citing this foundational act, Daniel:<p>&#8211; Reminds God&#8217;s people of His unmatched power.<p>&#8211; Grounds his plea for restoration in God&#8217;s past faithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>).<p>&#8226;

Personal righteousness does not exempt the prophet from identifying with national guilt&#8212;an example of intercessory humility.<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches universal guilt (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>);

Ezra used similar language upon Israel&#8217;s later return (<a href="/ezra/9-6.htm">Ezra 9:6</a>), showing that genuine revival is always confession-driven.<p>&#8226; By pairing &#8220;sinned&#8221;
