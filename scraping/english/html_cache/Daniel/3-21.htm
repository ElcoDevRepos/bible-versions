In biblical times, binding someone was a common practice to ensure they could not escape punishment. This imagery of being bound can be seen as a type of spiritual bondage, from which only divine intervention can deliver. It also foreshadows the binding of Jesus before His crucifixion, highlighting the theme of innocent suffering.<p><b>wearing robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes</b><br>The detailed description of their attire emphasizes their status and identity as officials in the Babylonian empire. These garments were likely made of fine materials, signifying their high rank and the wealth of the Babylonian court. The mention of specific clothing items also serves to highlight the miraculous nature of their deliverance, as these flammable materials were not consumed by the fire. This can be seen as a parallel to the incorruptibility of Christ, who, though fully human, was without sin.<p><b>and they were thrown into the blazing fiery furnace</b><br>The fiery furnace is a symbol of trial and persecution. Historically, such furnaces were used for smelting metals and could reach extremely high temperatures. The use of fire as a means of execution was intended to serve as a public spectacle and a deterrent to others. This event foreshadows the ultimate trial of Jesus Christ, who faced the fiery wrath of God on behalf of humanity. The furnace also represents the trials believers may face, with the promise of divine presence and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises to be with His people through fire and water.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shadrach,_meshach,_and_abednego.htm">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</a></b><br>These are the three Jewish men who were thrown into the fiery furnace for refusing to worship King Nebuchadnezzar's golden image.

As far as can be determined from the etymology of the words, the "coat" was an under-clothing, which covered the whole body; the "hose" was some species of tunic--something "spread out" over the under-clothing; the "hat" (the only one of the three words of which no Hebrew root exists (see <a href="/1_chronicles/15-27.htm" title="And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had on him an ephod of linen.">1Chronicles 15:27</a>), was a sort of cloak, used probably for State occasions only.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace</span>. The LXX. omits the complexity of garments, and translates, "Thus these men were bound, having their sandals, and their hats upon their heads, with their other garments, and were cast into the burning fiery furnace." It would seem that <span class="accented">karbelatheon</span> was either not in the text before the translator or was omitted by him. The latter hypothesis seems a hazardous one to adopt without good ground. We have no reason to accuse the Septuagint translator of this practice. Theodotion also presents signs of omission. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">but simply</span> transliterated, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Under this word Schleusner <span class="accented">says</span>, "Vestis Medica sou Babylonica ad genus pertingens." Aquila, it may be not,d, also transliterates, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, "Then those men were bound in their coats (?), and hats, and hosen, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace." The Peshitta does as Theodotion, and transliterates with the change of a <span class="accented">shin fur a samech</span>, in regard to the first word, and instead of <span class="accented">leboosheen</span>, "garments," has <span class="accented">qoobe'een</span>, which is rendered by Castelli <span class="accented">pileus</span>, or <span class="accented">g</span>,<span class="accented">lea</span>, a "military cap," or a "helmet." He wrongly says that <span class="accented">qoob'o is</span> used to translate <span class="accented">karbelathElon</span>; the word used for that is <span class="accented">nihtho.</span> We need not go into a discussion of the various garments named here. It is to be observed that, by the time of the Septuagint and the original of the version edited and revised by Theodotion, the moaning of the terms was lost - a thing hardly possible on the critical supposition that the date of Daniel is <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>, if, as seems necessary to suppose from the Greek prologue to Ecclesiasticus, it was already translated into Greek by, at latest, <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. The point brought out by these garments being mentioned is in order to show the power of God manifested on them. They were all of an inflammable material, therefore emphasis was given to the miracle by this. But, further, it shows they were taken as they were, without opportunity of putting on any specially medicated robes, if such could be imagined (but see <span class="accented">Longman's</span>, August, 1894, reference to Basil Thomson's' South Sea Yarns'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
