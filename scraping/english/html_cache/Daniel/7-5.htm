The bear's appearance suggests strength and ferocity, characteristics of the Medo-Persian military. Historically, the Medo-Persian Empire was known for its vast armies and conquests, aligning with the bear's formidable image. The sudden appearance indicates the swift rise of this empire after Babylon's fall.<p><b>It was raised up on one of its sides,</b><br>The bear being raised on one side signifies the imbalance between the Medes and the Persians, with the Persians being the dominant power. This detail reflects the historical reality where the Persian component of the empire was more powerful and influential than the Median. The imagery of being raised on one side highlights the unequal partnership within the empire.<p><b>and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.</b><br>The three ribs likely represent the three major conquests of the Medo-Persian Empire: Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt.

The phrase "gorge yourself on flesh" indicates the empire's aggressive expansion and the subjugation of other nations. This aligns with the biblical theme of God using empires to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah.

It is implied, therefore, that the second kingdom consists of two parts, and the raising up of one side implies that one part of the kingdom would come into greater prominence than the other. Such was the case with the Medo-Persian Empire (comp. <a href="/daniel/8-3.htm" title="Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.">Daniel 8:3</a>), in which the Persian element surpassed the Median.<p><span class= "bld">Three ribs.</span>--These cannot signify the people who constitute the second empire, but rather some kingdoms which had already been subdued by it; and by the command, "Arise and devour," the second empire is permitted to make further conquests before its disappearance.

"A second" is omitted, and instead of "they said", it is "one said" or "he said." Theodotion agrees with the Septuagint in omitting the word "second," but agrees with the Massoretic in having "they said." The Peshitta begins more abruptly than the others, "And the second beast [was] like to a bear," etc. In regard to the Aramaic text, the use of the haphel form must be observed. The presence of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> is an indication of antiquity in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">besar</span>), which becomes in the Targums <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>. It has been supposed that the reading should be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">bishayr</span>) with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which would mean" dominion" - a phrase that would give a sense out of harmony with the context. It is in regard to the meaning of this symbol that interpreters begin to be divided. The most common view is that this refers to the Median Empire. There is nothing to support the assumption that the author of Daniel distinguished between the Median and the Persian empires; everything, indeed, which, fairly interpreted, proves that, while he regarded the races as different, he looked upon the empire as one. It is the laws of "the Medes and the Persians" that are appealed to before Darius the Mede. The united empire is symbolized as a ram with two horns. Dr. Davidson, in his review of Professor Bevan's Commentary (<span class="accented">Critical Review</span>) on Daniel, shows the duality indicated by the animal raising one of its two sides. That one race was stronger than the other had to be symbolized, and this was done by making the symbolic animal raise one side. The attitude at first sight may be difficult to comprehend. There is a figure in Rawlinson's 'Five Great Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 332, in which a pair of winged bulls are kneeling with one leg; the side opposite to the kneeling leg is thus the higher. Kliefoth denounces this interpretation as mistaken, without assigning any reason against it. The interpretation by which he would supersede it is that it means "to one side of Babylonia." There is no reference to locality at all. Moreover, as all the animals come out of the sea, their relationship to Babylonia would be remote. <span class="accented">It had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it.</span> What is meant by these three ribs has been much debated. In the first place, Havernick thinks that it is a mistake to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">il'een</span>) "ribs;" he maintains the true rendering to be "tusks." He identifies <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;</span> (Hebrew); but even if we grant this identification, we do not find any justification for this rendering. The word for "tusks" seems rather to be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, which occurs in the Targum of <a href="/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> and <a href="/job/29-17.htm">Job 29:17</a>, and the same word occurs in the Peshitta. At the same time, the symmetry of the figure would fit some such view. In none of the other beasts is there any reference to what they are devouring. Still, one cannot lay stress on this. When we come to consider what is meant by the "three ribs," we have great diversity of opinion. On the supposition that the ribs are in the mouth of the bear, and being gnawed by it, it must mean that at the time when by the conquest of Babylon it came into the apocalyptic succession, the bear-empire had laid waste three territories. Ewald agrees that three countries must be meant, but assumes these countries to be Babylonia, Assyria, Syria. There is no evidence, Biblical or other, that the Median Empire ever extended to Syria. If we grant that the author of Daniel lived in the time of Epiphanes, then no authority open to him, so tar as we know, brought the Medes into Syria before the day of the Persian rule. We need not assume a blunder for our author, and then build further assumptions on that assumed blunder. Moreover, by the conquest of Babylonia and Assyria, the bear came into the apocalyptic succession, whereas he had already devoured those provinces represented by ribs when he appears. Hitzig, following Ben Ezra, takes the ribs as three cities - Nineveh and two others. There seems nothing to identify "ribs" with "cities;" we can imagine it to mean "provinces." Thus we are led to Kraniehfeld's opinion, that it represents constituent portions of an older confederation broken up. The view of Kliefoth, that the conquests of the Medo-Persian Empire are intended - Babylonia, Lydia, and Egypt - sins again st the symbol, which implies that the ribs are already in the bear's teeth when he enters into the sphere of apocalyptic history. Jephet-ibn-Ali maintains the "three fibs" to refer to the three quarters of the world over which the Persian Empire ruled; and this is the view of Keil. It seems better, with Von Lengerke, to regard the number three as not important, but a general term for a few, though, at the same time, we can make approximation to the number when we look not at the Medea, but at Cyrus. Moreover, had we a better knowledge of early apocalyptic, it is at least a possible thing that we might find that "three" was the designating number of Lydia or Armenia, as "two" was of Medo-Persia, "four" of Greece, "five" of Egypt, and "ten" of Rome. It seems to us that the position of Cyrus - at the time we assume the vision to have been given to Daniel - suits admirably with the picture of the bear. Like the bear, he came from the mountains, in contradistinction from the lion of the plains. He united under his rule his hereditary kingdom Ansan, Elam, and Media. Thus we might have the three ribs if we might lay aside the notion of these being devoured. He overthrew the Manda and Croesus before he conquered Babylon, and it is probable that Armenia had also to be conquered before he could encounter Croesus. It is singular that writers who are determined to maintain that Daniel drew all his information as to Babylonian history from Jeremiah and other early writers, should also, by implication, maintain that, in defiance of the continual mention by these writers of kings of the Medes, as if they were a numerous confederacy (<a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>), Daniel held that there was a united empire of the Medes separate from the Persian Empire.
