Visions often contain symbolic imagery and require interpretation. Daniel's role as a prophet is affirmed by his ability to receive and understand these divine messages, as seen throughout the book of Daniel.<p><b>in the citadel of Susa</b><br>Susa was an ancient city located in what is now southwestern Iran. It served as a capital of the Elamite, Persian, and Parthian empires. The mention of Susa is significant because it was a major center of power and administration in the Persian Empire. This setting foreshadows the vision's connection to future events involving the Persian Empire, which plays a crucial role in biblical prophecy.<p><b>in the province of Elam</b><br>Elam was an ancient civilization located east of Babylon, in present-day Iran. It is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament, often in relation to its interactions with Israel and other nations. The inclusion of Elam highlights the geographical and political context of the vision, emphasizing the reach and influence of the empires that would arise in this region.<p><b>I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal</b><br>The Ulai Canal, also known as the Eulaeus River, was a significant waterway near Susa. Its mention provides a specific geographical marker, grounding the vision in a real-world location. This detail underscores the historical accuracy and authenticity of the vision. The canal's proximity to Susa, a center of power, suggests the importance of the events Daniel is about to witness, which pertain to the rise and fall of empires, as further detailed in the subsequent verses of <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet and author of the book, who receives a vision from God.

Here the Ulai underscores Persia&#8217;s central role.<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;beside&#8221; the canal suggests a vantage point of clarity: Daniel sees global empires collide yet remains secure, echoing <a href="/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4-6</a> where a peaceful river contrasts chaotic nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a> grounds the forthcoming prophecy in a concrete time and place: God shows His servant&#8212;in real-time vision&#8212;standing in Persia&#8217;s future capital by the Ulai Canal. This geographical precision authenticates the revelation and signals the imminent rise of the Medo-Persian Empire that will replace Babylon.

At this time (see <span class= "ital">Records of the Past,</span> vol. 1, p. 71, &c.) Susa was, as Daniel describes it, in the province of Elam; at a later period it became the capital of the Persian empire. Daniel was at Susa only in vision, he was not bodily transported thither. The Ulai is the river Eulaeus, and is mentioned in connection with Susa in the inscription cited above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai</span>. The LXX. presents several slight differences, "And I saw in the vision of my dream, when I was in the city Susa, which is in the province Elymais, and I seemed in my vision to be at the gate Ailam." Theodotion renders more briefly, "And I was in Susa the palace (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), in the province Ailam, and I was on the Ubal." The Syriac is in close agreement with the Massoretic. even to the transcription of the doubtful word <span class="accented">Ubal.</span> The transcription is carried so far that <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "a city," is used to translate <span class="accented">m'deena</span>, "a province." Jerome renders <span class="accented">mdeena</span>, <span class="accented">cicitas</span>, and <span class="accented">uval</span>, <span class="accented">portam</span>, and <span class="accented">beera</span>, <span class="accented">castrum.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">oobal</span>) is nearly a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span>, absolutely so if we do not admit <span class="accented">joobal</span>, in <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>, to be the same word. There is, as will have been seen above, great differences among the versions. The LXX. and Jerome seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">oolam</span>), "porch" or "gate," instead of <span class="accented">oobal.</span> Ewald would make the word mean "river-basin," <span class="accented">Stromgebeit</span> - a view supported also by Zockler. In many respects "marsh" might be a more suitable rendering. To the south-west of the present ruins of Susa there is an extensive marsh, which may have been of old date. The preposition <span class="accented">liphnee</span>, which occurs in ver. 3, is all but meaningless applied to a river, if we use it in its ordinary meaning, "before." If we take it as meaning "eastward," the ram would be "westward" from Shushan, <span class="accented">ie.</span> between Shushan and the river; but as Daniel was in Shushan, he would naturally state the position of the "ram" in relation to it rather than to the river. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">al</span>) is nearly as meaningless with regard to a river, unless a bridge or a boat is intended. We are inclined to read <span class="accented">oolam</span> as "porch." At the same time, we know that there was the river Ulai (Eulaeus) near Shushan. It is mentioned in one of the inscriptions of Asshurbanipal in connection with Shushan (Smith's 'Asshurbanipal,' p. 130). <span class="accented">The palace. B.C.era</span> really seems to mean "fortress." It occurs ten times in Esther, and always as the appellation of Shushan. In Nehemiah it is once used with this connotation, but twice in regard to some building in Jerusalem, probably the temple; in Chronicles it is used for the temple. In <a href="/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a> it is used of Achmetha, equivalent to Ecbatana. From the fact that the LXX. translates <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, it might be reasoned that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> before him, but the translation probably was due to ignorance of the precise meaning of the word. In Esther this word is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. In Nehemiah it is once rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, once it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and once <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The derivation of the word seems to be from the <span class="cmt_word"></span> Assyrian <span class="accented">birtu.</span> It really means "citadel" or "fortress," and thus may be compared with the Carthaginian <span class="accented">byrsa.</span> Jerome's translation, <span class="accented">castrum</span>, suits this. It is not necessary to maintain that at this time Daniel was in Shushan. All that is implied is that in his dream he was there. Shushan is first referred to in the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal as the capital of Elam. In the history of that monarch there is an inscription of his given in which he says, "Shushan, the great city, the seat of their gods, the place of their oracle, I captured." Then follows a description of the plunder he took from it. We do not know when it recovered from that overthrow. The name is said to be derived from the number of lilies growing in the neighbourhood; but <span class="accented">shushan</span>, "a lily," is a Shemitie word, and the Elamites are usually regarded as an Aryan people. The association of Babylon with Elam and Media must have been intimate, if any credit is to be placed on the Greek accounts of the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, even if Elam was not, at the date specified, a province of the Babylonian Empire, perhaps never was, yet the Babylonian. court might well have envoys visiting the court of Elam. We find from the well-known inscription of Nabunahid, that he regarded Cyrus at first as a friend and deliverer from the formidable Astyages, King of Umman-Manda. Daniel <span class="accented">may</span> have been sent to Elam, although there is no necessity for maintaining that this was the case.
