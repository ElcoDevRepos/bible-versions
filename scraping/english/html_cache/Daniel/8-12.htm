Historically, this can be linked to the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king who desecrated the Jewish temple, leading to the Maccabean Revolt. The rebellion signifies a time when God's people turned away from His commandments, paralleling other biblical instances of rebellion, such as the Israelites' idolatry in the wilderness (Exodus 32).<p><b>the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to the horn</b><br>The "host" represents the people of God, and the "daily sacrifice" refers to the continual offerings made in the temple. The "horn" symbolizes a powerful ruler or kingdom, in this context, Antiochus IV, who disrupted the temple services. This event is a foreshadowing of future desecrations, including the abomination of desolation mentioned in <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a> and referenced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, indicating a pattern of persecution against God's worship.<p><b>and it flung truth to the ground</b><br>This phrase illustrates the suppression and distortion of God's truth. Antiochus IV attempted to eradicate Jewish religious practices and impose Hellenistic culture, symbolizing the broader spiritual warfare against divine truth. This act of casting truth to the ground is reminiscent of Satan's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> and his ongoing efforts to undermine God's word throughout history.<p><b>and prospered in whatever it did</b><br>Despite its rebellion against God, the horn experienced temporary success. This prosperity highlights the biblical theme that evil may flourish for a time, as seen in <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>, where the wicked appear to thrive. However, such success is ultimately fleeting, as God's justice prevails. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_little_horn.htm">The Little Horn</a></b><br>Represents a powerful ruler or kingdom that arises, often interpreted as Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the Jewish temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_host.htm">The Host</a></b><br>Refers to the people of God, possibly the Jewish nation, who are subjected to persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_regular_burnt_offering.htm">The Regular Burnt Offering</a></b><br>The daily sacrifices in the Jewish temple, which were disrupted by the actions of the little horn.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgression.htm">Transgression</a></b><br>The sin or rebellion that leads to the host being given over, possibly referring to the collective sins of the people or the specific actions of the oppressor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/truth.htm">Truth</a></b><br>Represents God's word and the faithful practice of worship, which is cast down by the little horn.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin and rebellion can lead to severe consequences, including the loss of God's protection and the rise of oppressive forces.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>Upholding God's truth is crucial, even when it is under attack.

It is known that some of them lapsed under the persecutions of Antiochus, and joined in his idolatrous rites. These apostates were given into his hand, and on account of their apostasy the daily sacrifice also was taken away. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The truth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the word of God, as appears from <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-43.htm" title="Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.">1 Maccabees 1:43-52</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-56.htm" title="And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they found, they burnt them with fire.">1 Maccabees 1:56</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-60.htm" title="At which time according to the commandment they put to death certain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.">1 Maccabees 1:60</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">prospered.</span> The renderings of the LXX. and Theodotion are closely related, and both differ from the Massoretic text. The first is, "And the sins were upon the sacrifice, and righteousness was fallen to the earth, and he (or, it) did, and prospered." Theodotion renders, "And sin was placed (given) upon the sacrifice, and righteousness is fallen to the earth, and he (it) did and prospered." The Peshitta is nearer the Massoretic text, but better in accordance with the Authorized Version, "A host was given against the perpetuity, in transgression the holy place was thrown to the ground, and he did and prospered." From the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) is omitted from the two Greek versions, we venture to omit it also; it has probably been inserted from the verse above. Both versions also omit the preposition before" transgression;" we omit it also. We would thus render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice, and," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, "truth was cast to the ground, and it did and prospered." After Judas Maccabaeus had cleansed the temple and offered sacrifices, sin mingled with it. We know that the stricter <span class="accented">Hasidim</span>, objected to the foreign alliances into which the Maccabees were inclined to enter; the battle of Beth-zecharias was largely lost by the abstention of the stricter party. After that, Lysias, representing really the same movement as Epiphanes, advanced to the capture of Bethshur. Thus it might be said of the little horn, that "it did and prospered." Were it not that there is no authority for it in the versions, we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>. In that ease we should render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice" - regarding this sacrifice as the atonement for the transgression (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>) - "and truth shall make peace in the land, and do and prosper." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And on account of rebellion,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1425;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
