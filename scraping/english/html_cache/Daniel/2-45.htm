The imagery of a stone cut without hands suggests a supernatural origin, pointing to God's direct action. In biblical typology, this stone is often seen as representing Jesus Christ, the cornerstone of God's kingdom (<a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>). The mountain signifies stability and permanence, indicating the enduring nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>and it shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold</b><br>The materials listed here represent the successive empires depicted in Nebuchadnezzar's dream: Babylon (gold), Medo-Persia (silver), Greece (bronze), Rome (iron), and a divided kingdom (iron mixed with clay). The stone's destruction of these materials signifies the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over earthly powers. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over human history and the eventual establishment of His eternal kingdom (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<p><b>so the great God has told the king what will happen in the future</b><br>This statement emphasizes God's omniscience and His control over future events. It reassures that the unfolding of history is under divine guidance. The revelation to Nebuchadnezzar, a pagan king, highlights God's willingness to reveal His plans to all humanity, not just Israel. This prophetic insight underscores the biblical theme of God's universal sovereignty and His plan for redemption through Christ.<p><b>The dream is true, and its interpretation is trustworthy.</b><br>Daniel affirms the reliability of both the dream and its interpretation, underscoring the certainty of God's word. This assurance reflects the biblical principle that God's revelations are faithful and will come to pass (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). The trustworthiness of the interpretation also serves to validate Daniel's role as a prophet and the authenticity of the biblical narrative.

In the language of prophecy, it must mean Mount Zion, which appears in other passages to be closely connected with the Messiah and His Kingdom, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm" title="But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law does he meditate day and night.">Psalm 1:2</a>. The stone is set free from this mountain, and as it rolls on in its destructive course, overthrows all the kingdoms of the world, and becomes a mountain which fills the whole earth. The Messiah is elsewhere spoken of under the figure of a stone (<a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>). The phrase "cut without hands" refers to the supernatural agency by which the stone accomplishes its work. The stone is now rolling, as the kingdom of God spreads further and further day by day. The image is still standing, the stone has not yet fallen upon it. When that moment arrives, and not till then, "the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ" (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ;
