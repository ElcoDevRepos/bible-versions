It reflects the covenant relationship God established with the patriarchs, highlighting Daniel's connection to his heritage. This continuity is crucial in understanding the faithfulness of God throughout Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, where God promises to be the God of Abraham's descendants.<p><b>I give thanks and praise</b><br>Daniel's response to divine revelation is one of gratitude and worship. This reflects a heart posture that recognizes God's sovereignty and benevolence. In the biblical context, thanksgiving is a common response to God's intervention, as seen in Psalms 100:4, which encourages entering God's presence with thanksgiving and praise.<p><b>because You have given me wisdom and power</b><br>Daniel attributes his ability to interpret the king's dream to God's endowment of wisdom and power. This mirrors the biblical theme that true wisdom and strength come from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, where the Lord gives wisdom. Daniel's acknowledgment contrasts with the Babylonian belief in human or mystical sources of wisdom.<p><b>And now You have made known to me what we have requested</b><br>This phrase highlights the efficacy of prayer and God's responsiveness to His people's petitions. Daniel and his friends sought God's mercy in prayer (<a href="/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a>), and this revelation is a direct answer to their request. It underscores the biblical principle found in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, where the prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.<p><b>for You have made known to us the dream of the king</b><br>The revelation of the king's dream signifies God's control over history and His ability to reveal mysteries. This event foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's plan through Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's promises and the revealer of divine mysteries (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>).

(See <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>.) The wisdom spoken of here does not refer to the dream, but to the same subjects as in <a href="/daniel/1-7.htm" title="To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.">Daniel 1:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">God of my fathers.--</span>Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm" title="And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word.">1Kings 18:36</a>, Psalms 105 God dealt gloriously with Israel of old. He continues to be faithful to His promises to Israel by blessing Daniel's education in secular subjects, and finally by the dream. Observe that to Daniel each appears alike supernatural, his proficiency in Chaldean wisdom, and his skill in interpreting dreams.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee; for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</span> The Septuagint renders, "Thee, O Lord of my fathers, i thank and praise, because thou gavest wisdom and knowledge to me, and now thou hast revealed to me what I entreated, in order to show the king concerning these things." There seems a slight difference of reading implied here. Theodotion and the Peshitta are practically at one with the Massoretic. Theodotion translates the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as if it were "and," not, as in our version, "for;" and the Peshitta repeats the first personal pronoun. Daniel now particularizes his reasons for praise and thanksgiving. He addresses God as the God of his fathers. He appeals to him as the covenant God of Israel, who had led their fathers through the wilderness. God revealed himself to Jacob at Bethel as "the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac." So to Moses at the burning bush he declared himself "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God. of Jacob." On the other hand, when Jacob approached God in prayer, he addressed him as "the God of my father Abraham, and the God of my father Isaac." God had shown kindness to his fathers: would he not also show kindness to their seed after them? <span class="accented">Who hast given me wisdom and might.</span> As <span class="accented">Jacob</span> in his prayer at Mahanaim (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>) not only pleads with God as the God of his fathers, but also as the God who had blessed him with his guidance before, so Daniel now further addresses God who had bestowed upon him "wisdom and might." When God has bestowed upon any one special faculties, he must presumably have a special work for him, rid it is therefore reasonable to plead with God to give an opportunity for the exercise of these special powers. Here it forms an occasion of thanksgiving. We are apt to forget that our powers, mental and physical, our <span class="accented">possessions</span> and acquirements, are gifts of God's grace for which we owe thanks. The special reason for gratitude, however, follows - God has answered the prayer of his servants. <span class="accented">Hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee.</span> It is to be noted that Daniel attributes the answer not merely to his own prayer, but to the united prayer of his three friends as well. Their earnest desire had gone along with his own in calling down the Divine answer. Daniel, while giving thanks for the knowledge vouchsafed to him, recognizes the help his friends had afforded. <span class="accented">For</span> <span class="accented">thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</span> Daniel assigns the reason here for his thanksgiving yet more definitely. God had made known to him what the king had required. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To You,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;
