In the context of the Medo-Persian empire, officials often worked in groups to maintain power and influence. This collective action underscores the threat Daniel posed to their authority due to his integrity and favor with King Darius. The group dynamic also reflects the biblical theme of opposition against God's people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where rulers conspire against the Lord's anointed.<p><b>and found Daniel petitioning</b><br>Daniel's act of petitioning refers to his prayer life, which was consistent and disciplined, as described earlier in the chapter. Despite the decree that prohibited prayer to anyone but King Darius, Daniel remained faithful to his practice of praying three times a day. This mirrors the steadfastness of other biblical figures like David, who also prayed regularly (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>). Daniel's commitment serves as a model of unwavering faith and obedience to God over human laws.<p><b>and imploring his God</b><br>Imploring indicates a deep, earnest plea, reflecting Daniel's dependence on God. This is significant in the context of the decree, as it shows Daniel's trust in God's sovereignty over the king's edict. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's people seeking divine intervention in times of crisis, such as Esther's plea for her people (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). Daniel's prayer life foreshadows the New Testament teaching on prayer, where believers are encouraged to present their requests to God with thanksgiving (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>). Daniel's faithfulness in prayer is a type of Christ, who also prayed earnestly to the Father, especially in times of trial (<a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41-44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.

The Septuagint reading is very different, "And they watched Daniel, and found him praying three times a day every day." It is difficult to decide which is the preferable reading, and almost as difficult to deduce the one reading from the other. Thcodotion has a reading akin to that of the Septuagint, "Then those men watched, and found Daniel praying, and. making entreaty to his God." This is akin to the Septuagint at the beginning, but is close to the Massoretic at the end. The Peshitta is in close agreement with Theodotion. It seems more in accordance with the plan of these presidents that they should not, as the Massoretic text asserts, rush tumultuously into the house of Daniel, but rather, as the three versions represent them doing, setting a watch, and then, when information reached them of Daniel's habits, acting accordingly. Nothing in the narrative makes it probable that there was a general assembling of the governors against Daniel; it was the action of his colleagues in the presidency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1440;&#1491;&#1463;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;il&#183;l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_479.htm">Strong's 479: </a> </span><span class="str2">These</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1467;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(gu&#7687;&#183;ray&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1400.htm">Strong's 1400: </a> </span><span class="str2">A person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went as a group</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(har&#183;gi&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7284.htm">Strong's 7284: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather tumultuously</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and found</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;ka&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
