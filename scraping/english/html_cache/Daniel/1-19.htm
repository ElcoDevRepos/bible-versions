In the Babylonian court, it was customary for the king to personally assess those who would serve him, ensuring they met the high standards required for royal service. This interaction highlights the importance of the occasion and the significance of the young men's potential roles in the kingdom.<p><b>and among all the young men</b><br>The reference to "all the young men" suggests a competitive environment where many were vying for positions of influence. These young men were likely from noble or royal families, taken from Judah during the Babylonian exile. This context underscores the rigorous selection process and the exceptional qualities required to stand out among peers.<p><b>he found no one equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b><br>This statement emphasizes the exceptional wisdom, knowledge, and character of these four individuals. Their Hebrew names are used here, which is significant as it reflects their identity and faithfulness to God despite being in a foreign land. Their superiority is not just in intellect but also in their commitment to God, which is a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>So they entered the king&#8217;s service</b><br>Entering the king's service was a prestigious position, granting them influence and the ability to impact the Babylonian empire. This phrase marks the beginning of their roles as God's representatives in a pagan court.

The Septuagint translates here <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which does mean "commune." Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Jerome has <span class="accented">loeutus</span>; the Peshitta has <span class="accented">malel</span>; all these may be rendered "talked." From Nebuchadnezzar's great reverence for the national religion and for the national magic, we may be certain that much of the conversation would turn on those magical formulae which have been to such a large extent preserved to us. Even if, as we think, the immediate occasion of Daniel and his companions appearing before the king was his "dream," still he would not unnaturally examine them further. It is not unlikely that this conversational examination would involve naturally the languages they would have to be proficient in were they to be of the royal council. They would have to be acquainted with Accadian, the original tongue of all the most sacred magical formulae; with Assyrian, the language in which the royal annals were recorded; and with Aramaic, which was, as we have already said, the language of commerce and diplomacy. Hebrew, the language of the four in whom we are more especially interested, was spoken, not merely by the holy people, but also by the Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, and the Phoenicians. Further, Egypt was a factor that had to be taken into account, and so, not unlikely, the tongue of Egypt would be known by some, at any rate, of the court officials in Babylon. The empire of the Hittites had certainly passed away, but, probably, their language was still known and spoken by a large number of the inhabitants of Nebuchadnezzar's extensive empire. Not only were the languages of peoples west of Babylon to be considered, but also those to the east; there were the Aryan tongues too. If the tradition is correct that Nebuchadnezzar married a Median wife, the Median tongue, which seems to have been the same with that of Persia, would be, above all, important, Not unlikely questions of policy and statecraft would be submitted to these candidates, to see what they would say. Above all, in personal intercourse the King of Babylon would be able to form some estimate of the real worth of these youths, There probably would enter in a large measure of caprice, or even superstition, into his choice, yet not unlikely his strong practical sense would limit his superstition. The result of this examination is eminently satisfactory to the young Hebrews. They were found superior to all their competitors. <span class="accented">Therefore stood they before the king.</span> Professor Bevan would render this "became his personal attendants" - a very natural translation. We know, from the Ninevite marbles, that the king is always, alike on the field of battle, the hunting-field, and the council-chamber, attended by eunuchs. It may, however, be regarded as referring to the special subjects of their study. As they had been admitted to the class of magicians and astrologers, it would mean they were admitted to the number of those who were royal magicians and astrologers - those whom the king consulted. It is not to be understood that, even though they were admitted to this number, they were therefore necessarily admitted before the king in this capacity on ordinary occasions. They would occupy but a subordinate position in the huge Babylonian hierarchy. We must note here a variation in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "they were." We, for our part, agree with Professor Bevan, in regarding this as a scribal blunder in the Greek, and that the original text was probably <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The only difficulty is that the blunder is also in Paulus Tellensis. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
