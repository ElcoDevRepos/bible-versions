This reflects the biblical theme of divine messages causing fear in those who are not aligned with God's will. Historically, Belshazzar was the co-regent of Babylon, ruling alongside his father Nabonidus. His fear contrasts with the confidence he displayed earlier in the chapter during the feast, highlighting the sudden shift from arrogance to dread when confronted with divine intervention.<p><b>his face grew even more pale</b><br>The physical reaction of Belshazzar underscores the intensity of his fear. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a pale face was often associated with fear or illness, indicating a loss of composure and control. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture to depict fear, such as in <a href="/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>, where Jacob's face will no longer grow pale when he sees God's salvation. The king's pallor symbolizes the impending judgment and the realization of his vulnerability before God.<p><b>and his nobles were bewildered</b><br>The nobles, who were part of the royal court and likely shared in Belshazzar's earlier revelry, are now confused and unable to provide answers. This bewilderment highlights the limitations of human wisdom and power when faced with divine mysteries. The nobles' inability to interpret the writing contrasts with Daniel's later interpretation, emphasizing the theme of God's wisdom surpassing human understanding. This moment foreshadows the fall of Babylon, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>, where the pride of Babylon is brought low.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_belshazzar.htm">King Belshazzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon during the time of this event.

Belshazzar&#8217;s growing dread signals that he senses divine judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, &#8220;The fear of man is a snare,&#8221; yet here the king&#8217;s fear is not of men but of God (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>). His dread anticipates the swift fulfillment of the writing: &#8220;MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The progression from fear to greater fear underlines that rejecting earlier warnings (Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s example in chs. 2&#8211;4) only invites harsher accountability (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His face grew even more pale</b><p>&#8226; Physiologically, pallor reflects drained strength; spiritually, it reveals a conscience stripped of any remaining bravado. <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a> asks, &#8220;Why do I see every man with his hands on his stomach&#8230; every face turned pale?&#8221;&#8212;a picture of judgment day.<p>&#8226; <a href="/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a> describes Nineveh&#8217;s downfall: &#8220;Hearts melt, knees knock, bodies tremble, every face grows pale.&#8221; Such echoes reinforce that Belshazzar&#8217;s colorless face is a precursor to national collapse that very night (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a> promises, &#8220;They looked to Him and were radiant,&#8221; but Belshazzar&#8217;s pallor contrasts sharply; those who trust God shine, those who despise Him blanch (cf. <a href="/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a> vs. <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His nobles were bewildered</b><p>&#8226; The elite who had feasted with him (<a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1-4</a>) shift from revelry to confusion. <a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm">Isaiah 19:3</a> foretells, &#8220;I will confound their plans,&#8221; showing that God can overturn earthly wisdom in an instant (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Their bewilderment fulfills <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>: &#8220;Where there is no guidance, a people falls.&#8221; The most powerful court in Babylon cannot interpret a single divine sentence without the prophet of God (<a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7-8, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-5</a> depicts rulers plotting against the Lord only to face His derision; likewise, these nobles scoffed while drinking from the temple vessels, yet now stand stupefied.<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that judgment reaches not only the king but his entourage&#8212;reminding every generation that proximity to unrepentant leadership carries shared consequences (<a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a> records a dramatic escalation: the king&#8217;s terror deepens, his complexion whitens, and his nobles find themselves utterly at a loss. The verse captures the moment when God&#8217;s handwriting shatters human arrogance, proving that no earthly power can withstand His verdict. Fear without repentance only multiplies; outward signs (a pale face) mirror inward collapse; and collective bewilderment exposes the bankruptcy of worldly wisdom. The handwriting on the wall stands unchanged, but those who heed it&#8212;turning to the God who reveals mysteries&#8212;find mercy, while those who refuse discover that divine judgment is neither vague nor delayed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) The terror of Belshazzar and his lords is caused by the impression that the inability of the wise men to read the inscription is the portent of some terrible calamity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied</span>. This verse presents signs also of being a repetition. The last clause appears to be the original form of the mysterious clause at the end of the sixth verse according to the Septuagint; the word <span class="accented">mishtabsheen</span>, which occurs here, seems to have been read <span class="accented">mishtabhareen</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shab'har</span>), "to be glorious," in the ittaphel; this becomes "to boast one's self," as in the Targum of <a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm">Proverbs 25:14</a>, also the Peshitta of the same passage; also <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>. And this is the word used by Paulus Tellensis to translate <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Septuagint has a verse here that has no equivalent in the Massoretic text, "Then the king called the queen about the sign, and showed her how great it was, and that no one had been able to declare to the king the interpretation of the writing." This verse avoids the repetition we find in the Massoretic text, and explains the presence of the queen in a much more plausible way than the received text does. In the Massoretic text it is the noise and tumult that pierces the women's apartments, and brings out the queen-mother; though not impossible, this is unlikely. The action of the king, as given in the Septuagint, is very probable. The wise men are baffled by this mysteriously appearing inscription. What is to be done? Belshazzar calls his mother, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, as she at least possibly was, to see if she knows anything in the past that might be a guide in such a matter. He not only shows her the sign, the inscription, but shows how great it was, by telling of the hand that had come out of the darkness, and had written it. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text.
