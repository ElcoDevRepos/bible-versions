They were considered experts in interpreting dreams and celestial events. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in astrology and divination as means to discern the will of the gods. The astrologers' response indicates their reliance on human wisdom and their limitations in understanding divine mysteries.<p><b>No one on earth can do what the king requests!</b><br>This statement underscores the impossibility of the task from a human perspective. It highlights the limitations of human wisdom and power, setting the stage for God's intervention.

Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, and Nebuchadnezzar was one of its most powerful rulers. This context underscores the king's authority and the fear he instilled in his subjects, yet even his power could not compel the impossible.<p><b>has ever asked anything like this</b><br>This phrase indicates that Nebuchadnezzar's request was unique and unreasonable by the standards of the time. It reflects the king's desperation for truth and certainty, which he believed could only be achieved through divine revelation. This sets the stage for God to demonstrate His sovereignty and wisdom through Daniel.<p><b>of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.</b><br>These terms refer to the various classes of wise men in Babylon, each with their own methods of divination and interpretation. Magicians and enchanters used rituals and incantations, while astrologers relied on celestial observations.

This seems to us a survival from an earlier condition of the text, when the Syriac forms were predominant, if not universal, in it. Scribes accustomed to speak and write in Chaldee would naturally harmonize the text to the language they were accustomed to use. The word "saying" ("and said," Authorized Version) is omitted from the. Septuagint, but it is found in all other versions: its omission in the Septuagint may have been due to error - the Aramaic is not complete without it. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">la-'itha</span>), "there is not." The ordinary Targumic and Talmudic usage is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">layith</span>), "is not." one word. This full way of writing this negative form is an undeniable proof of antiquity. Neither Levy nor Castell gives any example of the full writing which is the regular practice in Biblical Aramaic. Merx, 'Chrestomath. Targ.,' 168, 225, also gives only <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>. As a rule, the fuller a form is, the older it is. <span class="accented">Earth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dry groined-</span> the same word as is used in the Targum of Genesis, "Let the <span class="accented">dry land</span> appear," but not the usual word for "the world." Theodotion, in accordance, translates <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; the LXX. renders merely, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta has (<span class="accented">ar'a</span>). The <span class="accented">king's matter</span> (<span class="accented">mil-lath malea</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the king's word</span>, which, consequently, Theodotion translates <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The LXX renders, "to tell the king that which he has seen." It is evident that he read <span class="accented">milbdh</span>, as it' derived from <span class="accented">melal</span>, "to speak," as <span class="accented">lemallala.</span> The rendering, "that which he has seen," is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">d</span>); the verb <span class="accented">heva</span> was read <span class="accented">heza</span>, and then the change in meaning be. conies intelligible. <span class="accented">Therefore there is no king</span>, <span class="accented">lord</span>, <span class="accented">nor ruler.</span> The mote natural interpretation of the Aramaic is, "There is no king great and powerful." Some have regarded <span class="accented">ral</span>, <span class="accented">ushlat</span> as a title of the King of Babylon, but this does not seem to be borne out by inscriptions. The sense is rather that of 1he marginal rendering, "There is no king be he never so great and powerful." Then-dotion has this reading. The Septuagint renders, "<span class="accented">no</span> king and no ruler (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span><span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span>)," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">eol</span>) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">rab</span>). The Peshitta follows the Massoretic closely here. In this connection, it may be observed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shaleet</span>) is not frequent in the Targums, but it occurs in the Peshitta. <span class="accented">That asked such things. Kidnah</span>, "like this." This form of the demonstration, ending with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">h</span>), instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, is regarded as older than the Targumic form. Theodotion inserts <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> here. A<span class="accented">t any magician</span>, <span class="accented">or astrologer</span>, <span class="accented">or Chaldean.</span> The first thing that strikes the reader of the Aramaic, and for that matter the other versions, is the omission of one of the classes of soothsayers - that called "sorcerers" in our Authorized Version. We saw that, according to the Septuagint, the" Chaldeans" were not a separate college of augurs or soothsayers. When we look atlentively at the Aramaic, the reason of the presence of "Chaldeans" here, and the absence of "sorcerers" becomes probable. In the first place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is written without the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, as singular. When so written, its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">mekashshaph</span>) suggests the question whether there might not be, occupying this place, an Aramaic noun equivalent to <span class="accented">ashshaph</span>, which we see is really Assyrian, and, interpreting it we find <span class="accented">mekashshaph</span> put thus after <span class="accented">ashshaph</span> elsewhere, but omitted here. The solution of' the omission of <span class="accented">mekashshaph is</span> the likeness the latter part of the word bears to <span class="accented">Kusdt</span>, especially in the script of Egypt, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> were very like each other. These assembled wise men protest against the test to which the king would put them as essentially unfair. They had been trained to divine the future from dreams, but never to find out dreams by what they had learned from their airs the future would be; and in proof of this they urge that no king, however great, had made such a demand of any astrologer or soothsayer. Nay, they go further, and say that no man upon the earth is able to tell the king what he wishes. They endeavour to make the king see that what he asks is an impossibility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The astrologers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;a&#347;&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chaldeans -- a Chaldaean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1504;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6032.htm">Strong's 6032: </a> </span><span class="str2">To answer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3809.htm">Strong's 3809: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5922.htm">Strong's 5922: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yab&#183;be&#353;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3007.htm">Strong's 3007: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dry land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3202.htm">Strong's 3202: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be able</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;w&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
