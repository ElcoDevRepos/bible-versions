This reflects the biblical principle of persistent prayer, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, which encourages believers to "pray without ceasing." Daniel's prayer life is a model of devotion and consistency.<p><b>praying</b><br>Prayer is a central theme in Daniel's life, demonstrating his reliance on God. This act of praying is not just a ritual but a heartfelt communication with God, aligning with the practices of other biblical figures like David (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>) and Jesus (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>). It underscores the importance of prayer in maintaining a relationship with God.<p><b>confessing my sin and that of my people Israel</b><br>Daniel acknowledges both personal and corporate sin, showing humility and responsibility. This confession is reminiscent of the communal confessions found in <a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40-42</a> and <a href="/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6-7</a>. It highlights the biblical principle of repentance and the need for intercession on behalf of others, as seen in the priestly role of Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and presenting my petition before the LORD my God</b><br>Daniel brings his requests to God, demonstrating faith in God's ability to respond. This act of petition is a key aspect of prayer, as encouraged in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>. It reflects the trust in God's sovereignty and willingness to hear His people's cries, as seen in the prayers of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28-30</a>).<p><b>concerning His holy mountain&#8212;</b><br>The "holy mountain" refers to Jerusalem, specifically the Temple Mount, which holds significant religious and historical importance. It is the site of Solomon's Temple and later the Second Temple, central to Jewish worship. This phrase connects to prophecies about the restoration of Jerusalem and the coming of the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a> and <a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>.

He had not even finished his prayer when the answer came. The angel Gabriel, whom he had seen (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm" title="And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.">Daniel 8:16</a>), comes to him, and reveals to him the mystery of the seventy weeks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> All the versions are practically in agreement with the Massoretic text, save that none of them gives the hophal meaning, "caused to fly swiftly;" the nearest approach being in the Septuagint, in which we have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. All, however, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, "to fly;" another etymology is possible from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. As to the meaning of this word, there is a difference of opinion, Gesenius holding that it means "wearied out" - a meaning unsuited to the subject or to the context, though in accordance with the use of the word elsewhere. Meinbold would connect this word with the preceding clause, and refer it to Daniel, "when I was faint." The main difficulty is the succeeding word. Furst suggests that it means "shining in splendour" - a meaning perfectly suited to the circumstances, but for which there seems little justification in etymology from cognate tongues. Furst suggests a transposal from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. Winer gives it, "celeriter ivit, cucurrit." This view is taken by Hitzig, yon Lengerke, and Havernick. Ver. 20 is largely an expansion of the first clause of ver. 21. <span class="accented">Whiles I was speaking</span>, <span class="accented">and praying.</span> (comp. <a href="/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>, "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking"). This shows the rapidity of the Divine answer to prayer; even before we ask, "our Father knows what things we have need of." <span class="accented">The man Gabriel.</span> The name Gabriel, as mentioned above, means "Hero of God;" and the word here translated "man" is the ordinary word for "man," '<span class="accented">ish.</span> It may be remarked that in Scripture angels are always "men;" never, as in modern art and poetry, "women." <span class="accented">Whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning.</span> This really means "whom I had seen previously in vision," the reference being to <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>. <span class="accented">Being caused to fly swiftly. As</span> above mentioned, there is considerable difficulty in deciding which meaning is to be taken as the correct. Kliefoth's and Meinhold's view would be the simplest, if there were any certainty that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;</span> means "faintness." <span class="accented">Touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> Daniel is so absorbed in his devotions that not till Gabriel touched him did he recognize the presence of an an gel-visitant. The time of the evening offering does not imply that those offerings were made in Babylon, but simply that, through the half-century that had intervened since the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the sacred hour had been kept in remembrance, not impossibly as being one consecrated to prayer.
