It reflects the biblical theme of perseverance and faithfulness, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>, where Paul speaks of finishing the race. The phrase suggests a personal journey, indicating that Daniel's role in God's plan is complete, and he is to continue living faithfully. The "end" can be interpreted as the end of his life or the culmination of the age, a common theme in apocalyptic literature.<p><b>You will rest,</b><br>The promise of rest is a comforting assurance of peace after death, aligning with the biblical concept of believers entering into God's rest (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). In the Old Testament, rest often signifies a cessation from labor and struggle, as seen in the Sabbath rest (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). For Daniel, this rest implies a peaceful transition from his earthly life to a state of awaiting resurrection, reflecting the hope of eternal life.<p><b>and then you will arise</b><br>This phrase points to the resurrection, a core tenet of Christian eschatology. The idea of rising from the dead is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>, where Paul speaks of the resurrection at the last trumpet. Daniel's personal resurrection is a precursor to the general resurrection of the dead, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament. It underscores the belief in life after death and the ultimate victory over mortality.<p><b>to your inheritance</b><br>The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in biblical tradition, often referring to the Promised Land for Israel (<a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>) and, in a broader sense, the eternal inheritance promised to believers (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). For Daniel, this inheritance signifies his share in the eternal kingdom of God, a reward for his faithfulness. It reflects the assurance of a future hope and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>at the end of the days.</b><br>This phrase refers to the eschatological culmination of history, often associated with the Day of the Lord, a time of judgment and restoration (<a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>). It signifies the final establishment of God's kingdom and the fulfillment of prophetic visions. In the context of Daniel, it points to the ultimate resolution of the apocalyptic events described earlier in the book, aligning with the Christian hope of Christ's return and the renewal of all things (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his unwavering faith and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.

Theodotion closely resembles the LXX. in his rendering of this verse, "But go thou and rest, for there are yet days and hours to the fulfilment of the end, and thou shalt arise in thy lot at the end of days." The Pesbitta renders, "Go, Daniel, to the end, rest and arise at thy time at the end of days." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic text. As to the additional clause which appears in the version of the LXX. and in Theodotion, Origen has appended the mark which indicates that these words were only found in the LXX., or, at all events, had nothing corresponding to them in the Hebrew text of his day. <span class="accented">Go thou thy way.</span> Daniel is dismissed in peace, without having his question answered. Before Daniel was a course, and on that course he was to go, without occupying his thoughts with this secret thing. There is no word for "way" in the Hebrew or in any of the older versions. <span class="accented">Till the end.</span> The versions transpose this clause with that which follows. "The end" is not naturally the end of Daniel's life, for that ought to be "thy end;" still, the next clause seems to necessitate this. Hitzig would interpret the word <span class="accented">qaytz</span> as "goal" (<span class="accented">ziel</span>); but it is not the usual meaning of the word, and is not so used elsewhere in this passage. Professor Robertson Smith's suggestion (Bevan, 207), that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">qaytz</span>) is due to a mistake of a copyist, who has inserted it wrongly, is worthy of consideration. <span class="accented">For thou shalt rest.</span> This is rendered by Hitzig, "und magst ruhig sein" - "and you may be at rest." The fulfilment of the prophecy was fur a time long future, and Daniel need not disturb himself. Against this interpretation is the fact that the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nuah</span>), here translated "rest," never has the subjective meaning which Hitzig here attaches to it. The natural view is that of Ewald and most interpreters - "rest" in the grave. <span class="accented">And strand in thy lot at the end of the days.</span> In <a href="/jeremiah/13-25.htm">Jeremiah 13:25</a> "lot" is used for what is assigned by the judgment of God. "Standing in the lot" primarily suggests one taking possession of what has been assigned by Divine judgment. It is objected by Hitzig that the verb "to stand" does not mean to rise from the dead, which is true; but the connection necessitates this meaning, and as the idea of resurrection had not received theological definition, no technical word would have the exclusive claim to be used. Even now we do not always use "resurrection," and in poetry rarely do. "The end of days" must mean the end of time after the resurrection. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But as for you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">go on your way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until the end.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(laq&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7093.htm">Strong's 7093: </a> </span><span class="str2">An extremity, after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You will rest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1504;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;n&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5117.htm">Strong's 5117: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rest, settle down</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and will arise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to your inheritance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1430;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;r&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1486.htm">Strong's 1486: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lot -- a lot (for casting)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1445;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7093.htm">Strong's 7093: </a> </span><span class="str2">An extremity, after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the days.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/12-13.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 12:13 But go you your way until (Dan.
