In the context of Daniel, these watchers are part of the heavenly court that oversees the affairs of humanity. The concept of watchers is unique to the book of Daniel and reflects the belief in a divine council that participates in the governance of the world. This decree emphasizes the sovereignty of God and His use of angelic beings to execute His plans.<p><b>the verdict declared by the holy ones</b><br>The "holy ones" are likely synonymous with the watchers, emphasizing their purity and divine authority. This phrase underscores the idea that the decision is not arbitrary but comes from a place of divine holiness and justice. The use of "verdict" suggests a legal or judicial decision, reinforcing the theme of divine judgment found throughout the book of Daniel.<p><b>so that the living will know</b><br>This phrase indicates the purpose of the decree: to reveal a truth to all humanity. It highlights the didactic nature of God's actions, aiming to teach and demonstrate His power and authority. The emphasis on "the living" suggests that this knowledge is meant for those currently alive, underscoring the immediacy and relevance of the message.<p><b>that the Most High rules over the kingdom of mankind</b><br>The title "Most High" is a common designation for God in the Old Testament, emphasizing His supreme authority over all creation. This phrase asserts God's ultimate control over earthly kingdoms, a central theme in Daniel. It serves as a reminder that no human power can supersede divine authority, a message particularly relevant in the context of Babylonian dominance during Daniel's time.<p><b>and gives it to whom He wishes</b><br>This statement highlights God's sovereignty in appointing rulers and leaders according to His divine will. It reflects the biblical theme that earthly authority is granted by God, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>. This idea would have been particularly poignant for the Israelites in exile, reminding them that their situation was under God's control.<p><b>setting over it the lowliest of men.</b><br>This phrase suggests that God often chooses the humble or unexpected to fulfill His purposes, a recurring biblical theme. It echoes the idea found in <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a> and <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>, where God exalts the humble and brings down the proud. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who, though humble and lowly, is exalted as King of Kings. It also serves as a reminder that God's criteria for leadership differ from human expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who receives the dream and its interpretation.

They, too, longed that oppression should cease, and joining in the cry which for ever is going up from the oppressed to the throne of mercy and judgment, prayed for that chastisement which was to relieve the oppressed and convert the oppressor" (<span class= "ital">Lectures on Daniel,</span> p. 525).<p><span class= "bld">Ruleth</span> . . .--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Almighty God disposes of human empires as He pleases. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/5-21.htm" title="And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appoints over it whomsoever he will.">Daniel 5:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy odes: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men</span>. In this verse the difference between the Septuagint text - we mean the text behind that version - and that of the Massoretes is great. It is as follows: "Until he know the Lord of heaven to have power over all things which are in heaven and on the earth, and such things as he willeth to do, he doeth." This, as may be observed, is very much briefer than the Massoretic, and hence, to a certain extent, to be preferred. It is, however, difficult to imagine the genesis of the one from the other, as they have only two words in common in a similar connection, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shaleet</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yinedeoon</span>)' If we start with the supposition that the Massoretic text is the primary, we have a difficulty in seeing what reason induced this peculiar form of condensation. Had it been to get rid of <span class="accented">the decree of the watchers</span>, <span class="accented">and the demand of the holy ones</span>, that clause might have been simply omitted, and the sense would have given no sign of anything having been omitted. If, again, we start with the Septuagint text as our basis, it is difficult to understand what led to the insertion of "the decree of the watchers" and "the demand of the holy ones." Of course, the period of the Persian domination and that of the early Greek supremacy was one in which the angelic hierarchy was enormously increased and made vastly more complex than it had been before. Further, it is to be noted that "the watchers," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">ereen</span>), are here distinguished absolutely from "the holy ones," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">gad-deesbeen</span>), whereas in ver. 10 (13) "the watchers" and "the holy ones" are identified. This distinction is made in later Jewish commentators, and therefore its. presence here, fin contradistinction to ver. 13, is proof of a relatively late origin for this clause. Zockler would avoid this by asserting a parallelism of members in this sentence; but, in the first place, this is not verse, but prose, and therefore parallelism need not be expected. Further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "a decree" given by a person in authority, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>) is "a petition" presented to one in authority. So far from the two being identified in the verse before us, the watchers and the holy ones are as absolutely contrasted as they can be. Bevan simply appeals to ver. 10 (13) to prove their identity - sense has no influence with him. When we turn to Theodotion, we find that, in his practical identity with the Massoretic text, he has preserved the contrast between "<span class="accented">decree"</span> and "<span class="accented">petition</span>," the former word being represented by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the second by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. These two words represent fairly well the distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>). It is probable that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in order to show that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;</span> is to be regarded as genitive plural. The Peshitta follows the Massoretic, but less closely. It has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "watcher," in the singular. This clause in the Syriac should be rendered, "according to the decrees of the watcher is this order, and according to the word of the holy one is the request;" it retains the distinction in question much as it is in the received text, but with a distinct difference of meaning in regard to the ether words of the clause. So, too, Jerome in the Vulgate translates, "In sententia vigilum decretum eat et sermo sanctorum et petitio," thus maintaining, in all the confusion there is in this rendering, the distinction we have referred to. In the final clause, the Vulgate is further astray from the Massoretic. translating, <span class="accented">super eum.</span> The theology of this passage is singular, so singular that, were it not for the omission of the passage from the Septuagint. and its contradiction of ver. 13, we might be inclined to think it must be genuine. (For a similar statement, see <a href="/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, "The Law... was ordained by angels;" <a href="/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, "If the word spoken by angels was steadfast.") The view seems to be that the Almighty had a council of angels, and before them was every question discussed ere it was decreed. In short, that there was a heavenly sanhedrin, corresponding to that on earth - an idea which was developed by the Talmudists. It appears in Enoch, not vet fully developed. In Enoch 12. certain of the watchers are denounced as having defiled themselves with women; in ch. 20. we have the name of the holy angels who watch, and in this chapter we have the different provinces assigned to each of them. Six are enumerated. They have thus no collective function. In the portion of Enoch preserved in Syncellus, men are represented as calling to the heavens, and addressing them; and the four angels, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, give answer by looking down upon the earth, and they see the blood that is being shed by violence. Then follows the statement, "And the four archangels came before the Lord, and said." They may be here said to act in a collective capacity, but they have no deliberative function, still less have they any power to decree. The interpolated verse before us thus represents an angelo-logy more developed than that of the date of the Book of Enoch. <span class="accented">And setteth up over it the basest of men.</span> This phrase <span class="accented">suggests</span> the "vile person," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nibezeh</span>), of <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>, who is probably Epiphanes - the reference in this interpolated verse is not unlikely the same. The Syriac form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> in the K'thib has to be observed. One peculiarity which points to interpolation is the Hebrew plural here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anasheem</span>). Were it not that our <span class="accented">suspicions</span> of this verse are deepened by examination of it, we should be inclined to see a reference to that usurpation of Nebuchadnezzar's throne, which Lenormant thinks is implied in the title Neriglissar gives to his father. There seems to be a reference to something like this in ver. 24 of this chapter, according to the version of the LXX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This decision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(pi&#7791;&#183;&#7713;&#257;&#183;m&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6600.htm">Strong's 6600: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, answer, letter, decree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the decree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1494;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#7713;&#183;z&#234;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
