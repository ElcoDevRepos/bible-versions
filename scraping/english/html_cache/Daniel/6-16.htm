This reflects the legal system of the time, where even kings could not alter decrees once established (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8, 12</a>). It underscores the tension between human authority and divine providence.<p><b>and they brought Daniel</b><br>Daniel, a high-ranking official, was respected and trusted by the king, yet he faced persecution due to his faithfulness to God. This reflects the theme of righteous suffering found throughout Scripture, where God's servants often face trials (e.g., Joseph in <a href="/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39</a>, Paul in <a href="/acts/16.htm">Acts 16</a>).<p><b>and threw him into the den of lions</b><br>The lion's den was a form of execution used in ancient times, symbolizing a place of certain death. Archaeological evidence suggests that such dens were pits or enclosures used for executions. This act parallels the trials faced by believers who are persecuted for their faith, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>.<p><b>The king said to Daniel</b><br>King Darius's words reveal his inner conflict and hope for Daniel's deliverance. Despite being a pagan king, Darius recognized the power of Daniel's God, showing the influence of Daniel's testimony. This interaction is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where pagan rulers acknowledge God's power (e.g., Pharaoh in <a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-39</a>, Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>).<p><b>&#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221;</b><br>This statement acknowledges Daniel's unwavering faith and consistent service to God, which had a profound impact on those around him. It reflects the biblical principle that a life of faithful service can lead others to recognize God's sovereignty (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the deliverance and salvation themes found in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is the ultimate deliverer (<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.

In <a href="/bsb/daniel/6.htm">Daniel 6</a>, King Darius finds himself trapped by his own unchangeable decree (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Although distressed (6:14), he still issues the command because Medo-Persian law cannot be revoked (cf. <a href="/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment shows how human authority, even a king&#8217;s, is limited and fallible&#8212;contrasting sharply with God&#8217;s sovereign, unchanging rule (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Pilate later who yielded to pressure and sentenced Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>), Darius illustrates how rulers can recognize innocence yet capitulate to legal or political constraints.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they brought Daniel</b><p>&#8226;

his quiet submission echoes the conduct of Christ, &#8220;when He was reviled, He did not revile in return&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The faithful often face hostile circumstances precisely because they stand out for integrity (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God permits Daniel to be taken, affirming that trials are part of His refining process (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and threw him into the den of lions</b><p>&#8226; The den represents certain death, underscoring the gravity of Daniel&#8217;s predicament.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, &#8220;lions&#8221; symbolize deadly danger (<a href="/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment dramatizes the conflict between earthly threats and divine protection.<p>&#8226; By allowing Daniel to enter the den, God sets the stage for a miracle that will testify to His power before an entire empire (<a href="/daniel/6-26.htm">Daniel 6:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king said to Daniel</b><p>&#8226; Darius speaks personally, highlighting a relationship built on respect and admiration (<a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly rulers can perceive true godliness even if they do not fully understand it (<a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38-39</a> with Joseph and Pharaoh).<p>&#8226; His address reveals both regret for the injustice and hope for deliverance, demonstrating how God can stir conscience in unlikely places (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

Darius bears witness to the living God, asking for deliverance much like pagans on the ship with Jonah begged for mercy (<a href="/jonah/1-14.htm">Jonah 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement is both a confession of Daniel&#8217;s God and an intercessory plea, anticipating the deliverance praise in verse 20: &#8220;Has your God&#8230; been able to rescue you from the lions?&#8221;<p>&#8226; This plea foreshadows the gospel promise that God delivers from the ultimate &#8220;lion&#8221; of death (<a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16</a> captures the collision of human law and divine sovereignty. Darius, bound by an irrevocable edict, reluctantly consigns an innocent man to a lions&#8217; den. Daniel&#8217;s calm surrender displays steadfast faith, while the king&#8217;s plea&#8212;&#8220;May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!&#8221;&#8212;recognizes the only hope that transcends earthly power. The verse prepares readers for God&#8217;s dramatic rescue, reinforcing that unwavering service to the Lord invites trials but also provides the context for His unmistakable deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">They brought Daniel.--</span>According to Eastern custom, the sentence was generally executed on the day when it was pronounced. This explains why the king's efforts to commute the sentence were prolonged till sunset (<a href="/daniel/6-14.htm" title="Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.">Daniel 6:14</a>). The lions were probably kept here for sporting purposes. The form of the den is unknown, but the etymology suggests a vaulted chamber.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</span> The Septuagint Version here is not so likely to represent the original text, as there are symptoms of displacement, "Then Darius the king called out and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually three times a day, he will deliver thee out of the power of the lions; till the morning be of good cheer." The opening clause of the next verse in the Septuagint really represents the first clause of the verse before us, "And the king was grieved, and spake to cast Daniel into the den of lions." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The circumstances cannot fail to remind the reader of Herod with John the Baptist, and the still greater crime wrought by weakness - Pilate and our Lord. Darius had failed to overbear the opposition of the legalists who had determined on Daniel's death; he is obliged, therefore, to give the order that the sentence be executed. In doing so he commends his friend to the God, or the gods, if we take the K'thib instead of the Q'ri. Darius probably knew nothing of Daniel's religious beliefs, and therefore would be prone to imagine that he worshipped several gods, and to them he commends him. The addition of the Septuagint is picturesque, "Be of good cheer until the morning." Moreover, it fits in to what follows, and at the same time it is not of such a nature as that it should suggest itself to the ordinary interpolator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1436;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
