The phrase indicates that God responds to sincere prayer promptly. This reflects the biblical principle that God hears and answers the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). Daniel's prayer was characterized by confession, supplication, and a deep understanding of God's promises.<p><b>an answer went out</b><br>This suggests the immediacy of God's response to Daniel's prayer. It highlights the divine initiative in communication with humanity. The answer is delivered by the angel Gabriel, emphasizing the importance of angelic messengers in God's plan (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>). This also underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's purposes.<p><b>and I have come to tell you</b><br>Gabriel's role as a messenger is crucial here. His appearance to Daniel signifies the importance of the message. Gabriel is also seen in the New Testament, announcing the birth of John the Baptist and Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11-38</a>), linking the Old and New Testament revelations.<p><b>for you are highly precious</b><br>Daniel is described as "highly precious" or "greatly beloved," indicating his esteemed status before God. This reflects the biblical theme of God's favor towards those who are faithful and righteous (<a href="/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3-4</a>). Daniel's life of integrity and devotion sets a standard for believers.<p><b>So consider the message</b><br>Gabriel urges Daniel to pay careful attention to the message, highlighting the importance of understanding divine revelation. This is a call to discernment and wisdom, which are recurring themes in the wisdom literature of the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/2.htm">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>).<p><b>and understand the vision</b><br>Understanding the vision is crucial for Daniel, as it pertains to the future of Israel and God's redemptive plan. This vision includes the prophecy of the seventy weeks, which is significant in eschatological studies. It points to the coming of the Messiah and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises (<a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>).
