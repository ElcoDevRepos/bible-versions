In the historical context of the Seleucid Empire, this could refer to the internal treachery faced by Antiochus II Theos, who was betrayed by those within his own court. Biblically, this theme of betrayal by close associates is echoed in the story of Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>). The phrase highlights the vulnerability of leaders to those within their inner circle, a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>his army will be swept away,</b><br>This indicates a significant military defeat. Historically, this could refer to the battles where Antiochus II faced losses due to internal strife and external pressures. The imagery of an army being "swept away" is reminiscent of other biblical passages where God allows or causes the defeat of armies, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>, where the Egyptian army is swept away in the Red Sea. It underscores the idea that human power is ultimately subject to divine will.<p><b>and many will fall slain.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the scale of the defeat and the loss of life. In the context of Daniel's prophecies, it reflects the tumultuous and often violent transitions of power among the Hellenistic kingdoms following Alexander the Great's death. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of political intrigue and the fragility of human life. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where such violence will cease (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>The verse refers to a king whose close associates, those who eat from his provisions, will betray him.

Like Judas in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>, they were close enough to share meals yet ready to betray.<p>&#8226; God lets us see that danger sometimes rises from the very circle we think is safest. <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> reminds us, &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will seek to destroy him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;will seek to destroy him&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a>)<p>&#8226; The goal of the conspirators was not mere influence but ruin. Absalom&#8217;s plot against David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>) mirrors this kind of internal sabotage.<p>&#8226; For Ptolemy VI the result was political weakness; Antiochus marched in as a &#8220;protector,&#8221; effectively seizing control (cf. <a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this shows how sin operates from the inside out. <a href="/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a> notes that when sin is full-grown, it brings forth death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his army will be swept away</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;his army will be swept away&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a>)<p>&#8226; The Hebrew word picture is of a flood washing everything before it (see the same image in <a href="/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>). <a href="/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> uses identical language about Assyria overflowing Judah.<p>&#8226; Historically, the Egyptian forces were routed at Pelusium; Antiochus&#8217;s disciplined ranks overran them like a tide.<p>&#8226; The principle stands today: no matter how impressive human strength appears, it collapses when God&#8217;s prophetic timeline moves forward (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and many will fall slain</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and many will fall slain.&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a>)<p>&#8226; War&#8217;s human cost cannot be sanitized. <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a> speaks of &#8220;a day of vengeance&#8230; so the sword may devour.&#8221; The casualties noted here are real people, reminding us of the tragic consequences of rebellion and betrayal.<p>&#8226; The verse fulfills what Moses warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>&#8212;&#8220;Outside the sword will bereave, and inside terror&#8221;&#8212;when a nation turns from God&#8217;s ways.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment, God is just. <a href="/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a> affirms that His judgments are &#8220;true and just,&#8221; validating the moral order behind the events Daniel foresaw.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a> foretells an inside job: trusted officials betray their king, leading to his military collapse and heavy loss of life.

The false companions of the southern king betray him to the enemy; he is broken, the hostile army pours in, and many are slain. This has been referred to the second campaign of Antiochus in Egypt; however, history is silent of any treachery against Physcon. St. Jerome remarks: "<span class= "ital">Nostri secundum superiorem sensum interpretantur omnia de Antichristo qui nasciturus est de populo Jud?orum, et de Babylone venturus, primum superaturus est regem Egypti, qui est unus de tribus cornibus."</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain</span>. The Septuagint rendering here is different, "And his cares shall consume him and turn him away, and he shall pass by (and shall hiss, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); and many shall fall down wounded."

Theodotion is liker the Massoretic , "And they eat his provisions, and shall break him to pieces; and he shall overflow powers, and many shall fall wounded." The account of the invasion of Egypt by Epiphanes occurs in 1 Macc. 1:18. The Septuagint translator, appears to have read, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veochlay path-bago</span>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veachloo dageothav</span>).

The Peshitta rendering is, "They that eat his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall be dispersed, and many shall fall wounded." The Vulgate is closely related to this. This refers to the treachery which was alleged to have been at work and to have caused the overthrow of Philometor in his contest with his uncle. The version of the Septuagint is more picturesque, and more in accordance with facts. Cares might well devour Ptolemy Philometor - treachery in his army and his brother occupying his throne. Certainly he was defeated, turned asae, and was compelled to accompany the victor as a prisoner, while Egypt was wasted (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Those who eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
