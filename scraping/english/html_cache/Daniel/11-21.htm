Historically, this is often identified with Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his tyrannical rule and persecution of the Jewish people. The term "despicable" highlights his character and actions, which were detestable in the eyes of God and man. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God raising up leaders according to His purposes, even when they are wicked, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.<p><b>royal honors will not be given to him,</b><br>Antiochus IV did not come to power through the usual means of royal succession. He was not the rightful heir, as the throne should have gone to the son of Seleucus IV. This lack of legitimate royal honor underscores the illegitimacy of his rule. It reflects the biblical principle that God can allow rulers to rise without the traditional human endorsement, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>, where God chooses David over Saul's descendants.<p><b>but he will come in a time of peace</b><br>Antiochus IV took advantage of a period of relative stability to assert his control. This phrase suggests a deceptive calm, where the absence of immediate conflict allowed for his subtle rise to power. It mirrors the biblical warning against false peace, as in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where sudden destruction comes upon those who are complacent.<p><b>and seize the kingdom by intrigue.</b><br>Antiochus IV's rise was marked by cunning and deceit rather than open warfare. He used flattery, manipulation, and political maneuvering to gain control. This method of seizing power is reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, highlighting the theme of evil advancing through subtlety. It also foreshadows the Antichrist's rise in the end times, as described in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9-10</a>, where deception plays a key role in his ascent.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/despicable_person.htm">Despicable Person</a></b><br>This refers to a contemptible individual who rises to power through deceit and manipulation rather than through legitimate means.

The passage indicates that this person will not receive these honors, suggesting an illegitimate or unconventional rise to power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom.htm">Kingdom</a></b><br>The realm or territory over which this despicable person will rule.

Second Kings 11:1&#8211;3 shows a similar moment when Athaliah seized power without legitimate acclaim.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word underscores that earthly legitimacy comes from Him alone (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). When a ruler gains position apart from God&#8217;s design, instability follows (<a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will come in a time of peace</b><p>&#8226; Antiochus returned from Rome posing as a friendly &#8220;peacemaker,&#8221; winning trust through gifts and flattering words (<a href="/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a> describes this tactic: &#8220;His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The same strategy will characterize the future Antichrist, who &#8220;will confirm a covenant with many for one week&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>) before unleashing oppression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seize the kingdom by intrigue</b><p>&#8226; Instead of open warfare, Antiochus leveraged alliances, bribes, and deception to capture the throne (1 Maccabees 1:10&#8211;12 offers a historical echo, although non-canonical).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24&#8211;26</a> warns that hidden hatred &#8220;conceals itself with deception.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11&#8211;14</a> shows the beast likewise deceiving the earth&#8217;s inhabitants, proving that satanic power often prefers subtlety over swords.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a> pinpoints Antiochus IV Epiphanes as a fraudulent, manipulative ruler and sets a prophetic pattern for the final Antichrist. He rises without rightful honor, cloaks himself in promises of peace, and secures power through cunning schemes. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s Word accurately foretells history, exposes evil&#8217;s methods, and reassures believers that no matter how craftily wicked leaders ascend, their reign is temporary and under the sovereign control of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">A vile person.</span>--The meaning of the language will be plainer after a reference to <a href="/psalms/119-141.htm" title="I am small and despised: yet do not I forget your precepts.">Psalm 119:141</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>. The moral character of the man is especially described. The words that follow explain more fully that he was not worthy of receiving royal majesty. This person is generally identified with Antiochus Epiphanes. The description certainly agrees with him very closely. In fact, just as his predecessors resembled in various points the kings spoken of in <a href="/context/daniel/11-1.htm" title="Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.">Daniel 11:1-20</a>, so Antiochus resembles the person here described. The language of St. Jerome about early interpreters of the Book of Daniel is striking: "<span class= "ital">Cumque multa qu? postea lecturi et exposituri sumus super Antiochi persona conveniant, typum eum volunt Antichristi habere, et qu? in illo ex parte pr?ceperint, in Antichristo ex toto esse complenda.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">Peaceably.--</span>Unexpectedly, as LXX. (Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-25.htm" title="And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.">Daniel 8:25</a>.) The king is here represented as taking possession of the kingdom by craft, and in the following clause he is said to gain his end by "flatteries," or by intrigues and cunning hypocritical conduct. It does not appear that this was done by Antiochus Epiphanes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries</span>. As said above, the opening clause of this verse, as it appears in the Septuagint, really belongs to the previous verse, "And there shall stand up in his place a mean person (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and the glory of a king shall not be given to him, and he shall come suddenly, and the king shall be strong in his inheritance." Evidently the translator, has omitted the reduplication and has derived the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">halaqlaqqoth</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hel</span> <span class="accented">qah</span>), "a portion," "an inheritance." Theodotion's rendering is not very intelligible, "On his preparation he shall be set at naught, and they shall not give to him the glory of the kingdom, he shall come in prosperously (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>), and shall overpower the king dom by flatteries." It is, however, more in accordance with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is in practical agreement with the Massoretic, and the Vulgate reads as if a rendering of the Peshitta. It is assumed that this is Antiochus Epiphanes, yet there are considerable difficulties. A vile <span class="accented">person.</span> Certainly he was morally vile enough, though not nearly so vile as some of the kings of Egypt, his contemporaries, or some of his own ancestors. The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is "rejected, despised" (see <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). It may be that it was derived from the idea that the Romans rejected Epiphanes as a hostage, and demanded Demetrius the son of Seleucus instead, and so Epiphanes got the opportunity of returning to Syria. This, however, is not the aspect which the matter assumes in Appian. Seleucus appears as the party desiring the change of hostage. <span class="accented">To whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom.</span> That certainly is not the case; he had the kingdom as much as his brother had; he was acknowledged as king. He certainly had not the power his father had before his defeat at Magnesia, but he had as much as the semi-subject conditions of Syria permitted. <span class="accented">He shall come in peaceably.</span> That also is doubtful, for Eumenes of Pergamos supported his claims with an army. <span class="accented">Obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</span> Even that is not a prominent feature of the accession of Antiochus. The Septuagint, as will be seen, separates between the vile person who should not have the glory of the kingdom given to him, and the king who should be strong in his inheritance. If we were sure that Appian had followed Polybius, we might see in the first part of the verse Heliodorus, and in the second the coming of Epiphanes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(kan&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
