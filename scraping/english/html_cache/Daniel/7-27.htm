In the context of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, it follows a vision of four beasts representing successive empires. The phrase suggests a culmination of earthly kingdoms being replaced by a divine kingdom. The "kingdoms under all of heaven" implies a universal scope, encompassing all earthly realms. This reflects the biblical theme of God's ultimate authority over all nations, as seen in Psalms 22:28 and <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, where God's reign is established over the earth.<p><b>will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High.</b><br>The "saints of the Most High" refers to God's faithful people, often understood as those who remain true to God amidst persecution. This transfer of power to the saints is a recurring theme in biblical prophecy, highlighting the eventual vindication and exaltation of God's people. It echoes the promises found in passages like <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, where the meek inherit the earth, and <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>, where the faithful reign with Christ. This reflects the biblical principle that those who suffer for righteousness will ultimately be rewarded.<p><b>His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,</b><br>The everlasting nature of this kingdom contrasts with the temporary and often oppressive reigns of earthly empires. This eternal kingdom is a central theme in biblical prophecy, emphasizing God's unchanging sovereignty. It aligns with the promises made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where his throne is established forever, and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>. The eternal kingdom underscores the hope of a future where God's justice and peace prevail eternally.<p><b>and all rulers will serve and obey Him.</b><br>This phrase indicates a future where all earthly authorities recognize and submit to God's ultimate rule. It reflects the prophetic vision of universal acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee bows to Christ. This submission of rulers is a reversal of the rebellion and pride often associated with human governance, as depicted in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>. It points to a time when God's righteous rule is fully realized, and all creation aligns with His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints_of_the_most_high.htm">The Saints of the Most High</a></b><br>Refers to the faithful believers who are set apart for God.
