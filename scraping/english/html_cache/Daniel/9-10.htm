In the context of <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>, Daniel is confessing the sins of Israel, acknowledging their failure to heed God's voice. The "voice of the LORD" often refers to God's direct communication through His commandments and prophets. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel frequently turns away from God's instructions, leading to consequences such as exile. The concept of hearing and obeying God's voice is foundational, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience.<p><b>to walk in His laws</b><br>Walking in God's laws implies a lifestyle of consistent obedience and alignment with His commandments. The term "walk" is metaphorical, indicating a way of life or conduct. The laws refer to the Torah, the first five books of the Bible, which contain God's instructions for His people. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where adherence to His laws was a sign of faithfulness. <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a> extensively praises the beauty and righteousness of God's laws, emphasizing their role in guiding the believer's life.<p><b>which He set before us</b><br>This indicates that God's laws were clearly presented and accessible to the people. The setting before them suggests a deliberate act of revelation and instruction. In historical context, this refers to the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, where God established His covenant with Israel. The phrase implies that the people had no excuse for ignorance, as the laws were made known to them. This is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>, where Moses assures the people that God's commandments are not too difficult or beyond their reach.<p><b>through His servants the prophets</b><br>The prophets served as God's messengers, delivering His words and warnings to the people. This phrase acknowledges the role of the prophets in communicating God's will and calling the nation back to obedience. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were instrumental in reminding Israel of their covenant obligations and the consequences of disobedience. The prophetic tradition is crucial in the biblical narrative, as it points to both immediate and future fulfillments, including the coming of the Messiah. Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the prophetic office, as He perfectly reveals God's will and calls people to repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, living during the Babylonian exile.

Scripture treats God&#8217;s &#8220;voice&#8221; as both audible and written. &#8226; <a href="/genesis/3-10.htm">Genesis 3:10</a> shows Adam hearing the divine voice in the garden. &#8226; <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a> links hearing God&#8217;s voice with keeping His covenant. Ignoring that voice is never presented as ignorance but as willful rejection (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23&#8211;24</a>). Daniel&#8217;s words underline personal responsibility: the people heard, understood, and still refused to heed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the LORD our God</b><p>Daniel identifies the Speaker as &#8220;the LORD our God,&#8221; reminding the exiles that the covenant-making God still claims them. &#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a> anchors obedience in relationship: &#8220;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1&#8211;3</a> shows God&#8217;s ownership even when His people are scattered. The phrase stresses that rebellion is not against an abstract law, but against a personal Redeemer who rescued and sustained them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to walk in His laws</b><p>&#8220;Walk&#8221; points to a daily, lived-out obedience, not occasional religious moments. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a> urges, &#8220;Walk in all the way the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/psalms/119-1.htm">Psalm 119:1</a> celebrates those &#8220;who walk in the law of the LORD.&#8221; God&#8217;s statutes are portrayed as a path; turning aside means choosing a different route. Daniel highlights that Israel&#8217;s exile is the direct result of leaving that God-given path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which He set before us</b><p>The laws were not hidden or unclear. &#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11&#8211;14</a> insists the commandment &#8220;is not too difficult for you, nor is it beyond reach.&#8221; &#8226; <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5</a> says God &#8220;established a testimony in Jacob &#8230; that they should teach their children.&#8221; Accessibility removes every excuse. Daniel admits they ignored what was plainly laid out &#8220;before&#8221; them&#8212;right in front of their eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through His servants the prophets</b><p>God multiplied reminders by sending prophets across centuries. &#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a> records how the LORD &#8220;sent word to them through His messengers again and again,&#8221; yet the people mocked and despised them. &#8226; <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a> affirms, &#8220;Surely the Lord GOD does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.&#8221; Daniel stands as one of those very prophets, agreeing with their message and confessing the nation&#8217;s guilt for rejecting it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/9-10.htm">Daniel 9:10</a> lays out a layered indictment: Israel knowingly ignored God&#8217;s clear voice, abandoned covenant loyalty, refused daily obedience, dismissed the plainly revealed law, and scoffed at prophetic warnings. The verse explains why judgment fell and why mercy is still possible: the same covenant-keeping LORD who spoke through prophets now hears Daniel&#8217;s prayer of repentance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
