Wisdom and understanding were highly valued in ancient Near Eastern cultures, particularly in royal courts. The Hebrew terms for wisdom (&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;, chokmah) and understanding (&#1489;&#1460;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;, binah) often denote not only intellectual acumen but also practical skills and moral insight. This echoes the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><b>about which the king consulted them</b><br>King Nebuchadnezzar sought counsel from Daniel and his friends, indicating their esteemed position in the Babylonian court. This reflects the practice of ancient monarchs who relied on wise advisors for governance and decision-making. The king's consultation with them underscores their integration into the Babylonian system while maintaining their distinct identity as followers of the God of Israel.<p><b>he found them ten times better</b><br>The expression "ten times better" is a hyperbolic way to emphasize the exceptional superiority of Daniel and his friends. The number ten often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature. This phrase suggests that their wisdom and understanding were not just marginally better but overwhelmingly superior, pointing to divine favor and blessing.<p><b>than all the magicians and enchanters</b><br>Magicians and enchanters were common in ancient Mesopotamian courts, serving as advisors who practiced various forms of divination and magic. These individuals were considered wise men of their time, skilled in interpreting dreams and omens. The superiority of Daniel and his friends over these figures highlights the power of God-given wisdom over human and occult practices, reminiscent of Joseph's experience in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8-16</a>).<p><b>in his entire kingdom</b><br>The phrase "in his entire kingdom" underscores the vastness of Nebuchadnezzar's realm, which included diverse cultures and peoples. This broad scope emphasizes the widespread recognition of Daniel and his friends' abilities. It also foreshadows the influence they would have throughout the Babylonian Empire, aligning with God's plan to use them as His representatives in a foreign land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel_and_his_friends.htm">Daniel and His Friends</a></b><br>Daniel, along with Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were young Jewish men taken into Babylonian captivity.

This was no casual Q&A; it was the imperial test of Babylon&#8217;s finest.<p>- The king&#8217;s dependence on their answers parallels how nations sought Solomon&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/1_kings/4-34.htm">1 Kings 4:34</a>). Even pagan rulers instinctively turn to those who exhibit true insight.<p>- God positions His people where leaders will &#8220;consult&#8221; them, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>: &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings.&#8221;<p>- Expectation for believers: Excellence invites influence, giving opportunities to bear witness to God&#8217;s truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He found them ten times better</b><p>- &#8220;Ten times&#8221; speaks of an unmistakable margin, highlighting God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>) rather than mere human aptitude.<p>- Similar language of abundance appears in <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>, where God &#8220;is able to do immeasurably more&#8221; than we ask or imagine.<p>- Biblical pattern: when God empowers, the difference is evident&#8212;think of Elijah&#8217;s fire-consuming altar (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36-39</a>) or Jesus&#8217; &#8220;153 large fish&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-11.htm">John 21:11</a>).<p>- Life application: Our aim is not to be marginally better but markedly different because the Spirit of God dwells in us (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom</b><p>- The contrast pits God-given wisdom against occult practices. Babylon was famed for its magicians (<a href="/isaiah/47-12.htm">Isaiah 47:12-13</a>), yet even they were eclipsed.<p>- This recalls <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>, where Pharaoh&#8217;s sorcerers were outdone by Moses, and <a href="/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9-13</a>, where Simon the sorcerer believed after witnessing superior divine power.<p>- Scripture consistently exposes occultism as powerless next to the living God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). Daniel&#8217;s superiority is another public refutation.<p>- Believers today still face worldly &#8220;experts,&#8221; yet <a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a> reminds us, &#8220;He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a> illustrates that in every sphere&#8212;academic, practical, spiritual&#8212;God granted Daniel and his friends such surpassing wisdom that even a pagan emperor acknowledged it. Their excellence sprang from divine gifting, not Babylonian schooling, setting a pattern: when God&#8217;s people rely on Him, their competence outshines worldly alternatives, testifying to the supremacy of the Lord who &#8220;gives wisdom&#8221; and positions His servants before kings.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</span> The Septuagint rendering here has a considerable addition, which really means, as it seems to us, the coalescence of two readings. It reads thus: "And in all learning (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, a literal rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">dabhar</span>, 'a word' or 'thing'), and knowledge and education (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>) whatsoever the king asked of them, he found them ten times wiser than all the wise and learned men in all his kingdom." Thus far the verse is a rendering, almost slavishly close, of the Massoretic text; while the translator has recognized that the sentence is incomplete as it stands, and has inserted <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">al</span>) by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>. But the translation proceeds, "And the king honoured them, and appointed them rulers." This seems to have been due to a various reading. The sentence here translated was probably, in an old recension of the text, all that stood here, and some scribe, finding it, inserted it here to complete the sentence. The translation, however, proceeds yet further, "And constituted (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) them wiser than all those of his in affairs in all his land and in his kingdom." This sentence has all the appearance of an attempt to render into Greek a piece of Hebrew that the translator imperfectly understood. <span class="accented">As</span> we find that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, represents occasionally <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span>, and as the Syriac <span class="accented">vav</span> and the old Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> were almost identical in shape, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yod'a</span>,) might be read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> evidently the translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hacmeem</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hartummeem</span>), and has transferred the '<span class="accented">al col</span> from before <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> to before the next word, which seems to have read, not '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, but <span class="accented">hartzo</span>, the relative seems to have been omitted, and the second <span class="accented">col</span>, "all." This great variety of reading suggests suspicions of the verse altogether, which the content of the verse rather strengthens. Theodotion is in strict agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta also is at one with it in this, but these are late compared with the Septuagint. It has been tea,sued that the Book of Daniel is a story modelled on the history of Joseph, and the presence of <span class="accented">harlummeem</span> here is regarded as a proof of this <span class="accented">quasi</span> Egyptian origin (see <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, etc.). One thing is clear, that the word - whatever it was - was unknown in Alexandria, where this translation was made; <span class="accented">hartummeern</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> occurring in the Pentateuch, the earliest part of the Old Testament translated, was certain to be known: how did the word here happen not to be known? We can understand the phenomenon if some word, probably of Babylonian origin, and unknown in Egypt and Palestine, occupied the place and was modified into a more intelligible shape by being turned into <span class="accented">hartummeem.</span> As the verse stands, <span class="accented">hartummeem is</span> grammatically placed in apposition to the following word, '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, as there is no conjunction to unite the two words. It is acknowledged by Professor Bevan that the latter word has an Assyrian origin; it is not inconceivable that <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> is really the explanatory word, though the arrangement of the words is decidedly against this view. It is to be observed here that '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span> has been naturalized in Eastern Aramaic, but has not found a lodgment in Western, save in Daniel. We cannot help feeling a little suspicion of the authenticity of this verse. This phrase, "ten times better," has all the look of that exaggeration which became the prevailing vice of later Judaism. As we have indicated, the variations in regard to the precise reading deepen this suspicion. If, however, the reference here is really to Daniel's revelation to the king of his dream, then the statement in the text is less objectionable. This was such a marvellous feat, and one that so put Daniel boys all the wise men of Babylon, that the language of the verse before us is rather rhetorical than exaggerated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
