These men were likely high-ranking officials or satraps who were envious of Daniel's favor with King Darius. Their plotting reflects the political intrigue common in ancient Near Eastern courts, where power struggles were frequent. The use of "finally" suggests a persistent and determined effort to undermine Daniel.<p><b>We will never find any charge against this Daniel</b><br>Daniel's integrity and faithfulness are highlighted here. Despite their scrutiny, his adversaries could find no fault in his conduct. This mirrors the biblical theme of the righteous being blameless before God and man, as seen in <a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>. Daniel's exemplary character serves as a type of Christ, who was also without sin and faced false accusations (<a href="/john/19-4.htm">John 19:4</a>).<p><b>unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God</b><br>The only vulnerability they could exploit was Daniel's unwavering commitment to his faith. This reflects the tension between divine law and human law, a recurring theme in Scripture. Daniel's adherence to God's law over the king's edicts foreshadows the apostles' declaration in <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, "We must obey God rather than men." This phrase also underscores the prophetic nature of Daniel's life, as his faithfulness prefigures the persecution of believers who prioritize God's commandments over earthly decrees.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Jewish exile in Babylon, known for his unwavering faith and integrity.
