The title "chief of the magicians" indicates Daniel's high status in the Babylonian court, a position he earned due to his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams, as seen in <a href="/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20 and 2</a>:48. This role places him among the wise men of Babylon, yet his abilities are distinct, attributed to divine insight rather than mere human wisdom.<p><b>I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges a divine presence in Daniel, though he interprets it through his polytheistic worldview. The phrase "spirit of the holy gods" reflects the king's understanding, yet for Daniel, it signifies the Spirit of the one true God. This recognition of divine influence is consistent with earlier chapters, where Daniel's wisdom and insight are attributed to God (<a href="/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>).<p><b>and that no mystery baffles you</b><br>Daniel's reputation for solving mysteries is well-established, as demonstrated in his interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's previous dream (Daniel 2). This ability is not due to his own power but is a gift from God, who reveals deep and hidden things (<a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of divine revelation throughout the book of Daniel.<p><b>So explain to me the visions I saw in my dream, and their interpretation</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's request for an explanation of his dream highlights the recurring theme of dreams and visions in the book of Daniel, which serve as a means of divine communication. The king's reliance on Daniel for interpretation underscores the inadequacy of Babylonian wisdom compared to the wisdom given by God. This request sets the stage for the revelation of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms, a central message in Daniel's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belteshazzar.htm">Belteshazzar (Daniel)</a></b><br>Daniel, a Hebrew prophet, is referred to by his Babylonian name, Belteshazzar.

Theodotion and the Peshitta both have this passage, but with slight variations from the Massoretic text. Instead of "No secret troubleth [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, '<span class="accented">anays</span>, 'compel,' <a href="/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a>] thee," Thedotion renders, "No secret (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baffles (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) thee." The Peshitta renders. "And no secret is hid (<span class="accented">ethcasee</span>) from thee," reading, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Behrmann, who translates the word by <span class="accented">verborgen</span>, thinks the choice of the word occasioned by <a href="/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> secret is hid from thee" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5da;</span>), this last word, he thinks, occasioning the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5e1;</span>; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>: is used in Aramaic (see <a href="/leviticus/13-6.htm">Leviticus 13:6</a>, "dark" of the spot of leprosy). It seems more probable that there is some mistake in the reading. The Massoretic reading of the last clause seems modelled on the situation in the second chapter, where Nebuchadnezzar demands of the magicians that they not only give the interpretation of the dream, but tell the dream itself. The versions here do not agree with the Massoretic. Theodotion renders, "Hear the vision (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) of the dream which I saw, and tell me its interpretation." The Peshitta has, "In the vision of my dream I was seeing visions of my head, and tell me the interpretation." The Massoretic reading contradicts the situation, and the variety of reading in the two versions confirms the suspicion of this verse induced by its absence from the Septuagint. "Master of the magicians" (<span class="accented">rob-hartum-maya</span>). There is nothing in <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a> about the promotion of Daniel over the "magi-clans," but only over the "governors (<span class="accented">signeen</span>) of the wise men (<span class="accented">hakaymeen</span>) of Babylon" This is not to be in itself regarded as a proof of antagonism between these verses and the earlier portion of the, book, as Daniel might have been promoted in the interval. The Peshitta calls Daniel <span class="accented">rab-hahmeen</span>, "chief of the wise men;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also to be observed that the writer of these verses does not make Daniel <span class="accented">rab-mag</span>, which so generally was anciently understood to mean "master of the magicians." Avoiding an alluring blunder is often as clear a proof of knowledge as a directly correct statement. "Spirit of the holy gods;" not "<span class="accented">the</span> Spirit," but "<span class="accented">a</span> spirit." The Authorized Version is here correct in translating "gods," not "God," as the adjective is plural; not as Theodotion, who renders, "a holy spirit of God," reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;O Belteshazzar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1496;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">Belteshazzar -- Babylonian name of Daniel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">chief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7229.htm">Strong's 7229: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abundant </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the magicians,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1496;&#1467;&#1502;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ar&#183;&#7789;u&#183;may&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2749.htm">Strong's 2749: </a> </span><span class="str2">A horoscopist</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
