The "king of the South" is typically identified with the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled over Egypt. This period of history is marked by the ongoing conflict between the Seleucid and Ptolemaic empires, known as the Syrian Wars. The geopolitical struggle for control over the territories between these two powers is a significant backdrop for this prophecy. The phrase also reflects the broader theme of conflict and power struggles that are prevalent throughout the Book of Daniel, illustrating the transient nature of earthly kingdoms in contrast to God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>and then return to his own land</b><br>This part of the verse indicates the outcome of the invasion, where the northern king, after his campaign, retreats back to his own territory. Historically, this can be seen in the context of Antiochus III's campaigns, where he initially had success but eventually had to withdraw. This retreat could be due to various factors such as military setbacks, political pressure, or strategic decisions. Theologically, this return signifies the limitations of human ambition and power, as even the mightiest rulers are subject to the sovereign plans of God. This theme is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the Psalms and Proverbs, where human plans are ultimately subject to divine will. The cyclical nature of these invasions and retreats underscores the futility of relying on human strength and the importance of trusting in God's ultimate plan for history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>This refers to a ruler from the northern territories relative to Israel, historically associated with the Seleucid Empire.

The text affirms:<p>&#8226; God foresaw the precise ruler centuries before he rose to power, underlining <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>&#8212;He &#8220;declares the end from the beginning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The designation &#8220;North&#8221; follows the geography from Judah&#8217;s vantage point, the same perspective used in earlier prophecies (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the realm of the king of the South</b><p>The &#8220;king of the South&#8221; is the Ptolemaic monarch ruling from Egypt (<a href="/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>).

Theodotion renders, "And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and return into his land." The Peshitta differs more, "The king of the south shall enter in strength, and turn to his own land." The Vulgate does not differ from the others. This verse, assuming the king of the south, Ptolemy Euergetes, to be the subject of the verb, merely completes the statements of the previous verse, and seems to describe the triumphant return of Euergetes into Egypt. If we take - which, however, is not so natural - the king of the north as the subject, then the reference may be to the unsuccessful attempts made by Seleucus Callinicus to invade Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">who will invade</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the realm</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;mal&#183;&#7733;&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4438.htm">Strong's 4438: </a> </span><span class="str2">Royalty, royal power, reign, kingdom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the South</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1490;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ne&#183;&#7713;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5045.htm">Strong's 5045: </a> </span><span class="str2">South country, the Negeb, south</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and then return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own land.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7695;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_127.htm">Strong's 127: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ground, land</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/11-9.htm">Daniel 11:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/11-9.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 11:9 He shall come into the realm (Dan.
