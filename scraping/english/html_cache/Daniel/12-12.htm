In the biblical context, waiting often implies trusting in God's timing and promises. The concept of being "blessed" is reminiscent of the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus pronounces blessings on those who exhibit certain godly characteristics. The idea of waiting is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who wait on the Lord renew their strength. This waiting is not passive but involves active faith and perseverance through trials.<p><b>and reaches the end</b><br>The phrase suggests a journey or a period of trial that must be endured. In the context of Daniel, this likely refers to a time of tribulation or testing. The end signifies the completion of a prophetic timeline, which is a common theme in apocalyptic literature. This echoes the perseverance of the saints mentioned in <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>, where endurance is linked to keeping faith in Jesus.<p><b>of the 1,335 days.</b><br>The specific number of days is part of a prophetic timeline that has intrigued scholars and theologians. It follows the mention of 1,290 days in the previous verse, suggesting a period of waiting beyond a significant event. Historically, this has been interpreted in various ways, including literal and symbolic understandings. Some see it as a period of purification or a time leading to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises. The number may also connect to the broader eschatological themes in Daniel, where precise timeframes are used to convey God's sovereign control over history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and the author of the Book of Daniel, who receives visions and prophecies about the future of Israel and the end times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_1,335_days.htm">The 1,335 Days</a></b><br>A prophetic period mentioned in <a href="/daniel/12-12.htm">Daniel 12:12</a>, which follows the 1,290 days mentioned in the previous verse.
