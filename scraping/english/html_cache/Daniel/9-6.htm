Throughout the Old Testament, prophets were sent by God to guide, warn, and call the people back to righteousness (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>, <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). The failure to heed these messages often led to judgment and exile, as seen in the Babylonian captivity. This disobedience is a reflection of the human tendency to ignore divine warnings, emphasizing the need for repentance and obedience.<p><b>who spoke in Your name</b><br>Prophets spoke with divine authority, delivering messages directly from God. Speaking "in Your name" signifies that their words carried the weight and truth of God's own voice (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a>). This underscores the seriousness of ignoring their messages, as it equates to disregarding God Himself. The authority of speaking in God's name is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus and the apostles performed their ministries in the name of God (<a href="/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>, <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>).<p><b>to our kings, leaders, fathers</b><br>The message was directed not only to the common people but also to those in positions of authority and influence. Kings and leaders were expected to set an example of faithfulness and obedience (<a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). The failure of these figures often led the nation astray, as seen in the reigns of kings like Manasseh and Ahab. The mention of "fathers" indicates the generational aspect of disobedience, where the sins of one generation affect the next (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><b>and all the people of the land</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal nature of the prophetic message. It was not limited to a select group but was intended for the entire nation. The inclusion of "all the people" highlights the collective responsibility of the community to adhere to God's commands. This collective accountability is a recurring theme in Scripture, where the actions of individuals and leaders impact the whole community (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>, <a href="/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32-34</a>). The call to repentance and obedience is thus a communal call, urging everyone to return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian exile, known for his faithfulness to God and his role in interpreting dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers sent by God to deliver His word and warnings to the people of Israel and Judah.

The Septuagint, while agreeing in the main with the Massoretic, translates "to all the people of the land" as "to every nation on the earth." Theodotion is more accurate, but the Peshitta maintains the ambiguity. Daniel continues his confession of sin. Not only will they not keep God's commands, but when God sent prophets, men of their brethren, to speak to them with human voice, they would not hearken. The designation of the ordinary inhabitants, the common people, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> ('<span class="accented">am ha'aretz.</span>) is a usage that became more pronounced in later days, when all not educated as rabbin were called 'am <span class="accented">ha'aretz.</span> The resemblance is striking between this passage and <a href="/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30-32</a>. It is, perhaps, impossible to settle on merely critical grounds which is the more primitive form. There is much in both passages that would suggest a third form, the independent source of both. Not unlikely the source was some liturgic prayer. As the shorter, the passage before us may be nearer this original source. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">We have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
