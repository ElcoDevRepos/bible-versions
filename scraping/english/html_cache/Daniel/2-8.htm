His authority and power are significant, as Babylon was a dominant empire during this period. The king's response is crucial in understanding the tension between him and his advisors. This interaction sets the stage for the unfolding events in the chapter, highlighting the king's impatience and the pressure on his wise men.<p><b>I know for sure</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's certainty reflects his suspicion and distrust of his advisors. This phrase indicates his awareness of their tactics and his determination to uncover the truth. The king's confidence in his judgment underscores his role as a decisive and authoritative leader, which is a recurring theme in the book of Daniel.<p><b>that you are stalling for time</b><br>The accusation of stalling suggests that the wise men are unable to fulfill the king's demands. This reflects the cultural and historical context where advisors were expected to interpret dreams and provide counsel. The inability to do so would have been seen as a failure of their wisdom and skills. This situation sets the stage for Daniel's later intervention, showcasing the limitations of human wisdom compared to divine revelation.<p><b>because you see that my word is final</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's assertion of his word being final emphasizes the absolute power he wielded as king. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's decree was binding and unchangeable. This phrase highlights the seriousness of the situation and the urgency for the wise men to provide an answer. It also foreshadows the divine intervention that will come through Daniel, contrasting human authority with God's ultimate sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who had a troubling dream that he demanded to be interpreted without revealing its content.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans</a></b><br>A group of wise men, astrologers, and magicians in Babylon tasked with interpreting dreams and advising the king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew captive in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams through God's revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where these events take place, known for its grandeur and as a center of power and culture during this period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>A mysterious vision given to Nebuchadnezzar, which none of the king's wise men could interpret without knowing the dream itself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God alone reveals mysteries and holds the ultimate knowledge of all things.

His statement highlights human authority at its highest&#8212;and paves the way for God to display a far greater authority through Daniel&#8217;s supernatural revelation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Gain time.--</span>They hoped that by continual postponement they would induce the king to let the matter pass over; or, if not, that they might be able to wheedle the dream out of him,<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</span> The versions here do not differ in any essential point. The king now becomes certain of the treasonable purpose of the soothsayers. The word <span class="accented">zeban</span> means not so much "gain" as "purchase," "barter." To the king the meaning of their obstinate refusal to submit to his requirements is that they know that some great advantage may be gained by the king, or some great disaster forefended, if he only knows the meaning of this dream, and that if the king does not submit to them and yield up his decree, and, putting his pride under his feet, tell them the dream, the time when its revelation may be taken advantage of may be passed. In these matters everything was supposed to depend on the thing to be done being done precisely at the right conjunction of the planets. His last utterance seems almost to rise to agony, "Because ye see the thing is fixed away from me!" We have the same word (<span class="accented">azda</span>) translated here, as in the fifth verse, "gone." As we saw above, its real meaning is rather "fixed," "settled," "determined." His decree had gone out, and he would not - nay, so strongly had he willed at that it was as it' he could not - alter his decision. It has been regarded as bearing on this passage that St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>) uses the same word as that by which the Greek versions translate <span class="accented">zeban</span>, "redeeming the time, because the days are evil." The meaning of the apostle is to some extent in contrast to that here. Believers are, as it were, to purchase the time from the evil days. Nebuchadnezzar thought the astrologers were, as it were, meaning by their delays to buy the auspicious moment for the kingdom from under his feet. It is a mistaken idea that he thought they merely wished to gain time. It would I seem, from what we read further of his treatment of Daniel's request lot time, that, had they merely asked for time, Nebuchadnezzar would have granted their request. He had staked his faith in their ability to unfold any mystery on this one test, and they seemed to him obstinately to refuse to submit to it. To believe them unable to reveal the truth that he wished, would be to overturn all the fabric of his faith in the religion of <span class="accented">his</span> fathers; therefore, with all the strength of a strong man. and all the blind faith of a fanatic, he will not acknowledge the inability of the soothsayers to tell him his dream; it must be obstinacy, he thinks, that prevents the soothsayers telling him, and that obstinacy must have a sinister purpose. There is a clause in the Septuagint completing this verse, but it is not parallel with any clause in the Massoretic text: "Then just as I have ordered, thus shall it be." This probably is an alternative rendering. <span class="accented">Azda is</span> taken in what is now regarded as its meaning - "that which is fixed," or "decreed," in which case this final clause might be rendered, "What is fixed from me is a decree;" and of this the above-mentioned clause is a somewhat free rendering. This interpretation of the clause confirms our view of the situation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
