Historically, this can be linked to the period of the Maccabean Revolt, where the Jewish people faced oppression under Antiochus IV Epiphanes. The "fall" signifies a period of trial and testing, which is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in the trials of Job and the persecution of early Christians (e.g., <a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1</a>).<p><b>they will be granted a little help</b><br>The "little help" suggests divine intervention or support, albeit limited. During the Maccabean period, this could refer to the initial successes of the Maccabean forces against their oppressors. Biblically, God often provides aid to His people in times of distress, as seen in the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (Exodus 14) and the support given to the early church (<a href="/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5-11</a>).<p><b>but many will join them insincerely</b><br>This indicates that not all who join the cause are genuine in their intentions. Historically, during the Maccabean Revolt, some joined the resistance for personal gain or out of fear rather than true conviction. This reflects the biblical theme of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where true believers and false followers coexist.

Their &#8220;fall&#8221; is real suffering&#8212;loss of life, liberty, and property&#8212;yet not a final defeat. Scripture often portrays godly people stumbling under oppression while still held by God&#8217;s purpose. Think of <a href="/psalms/37-24.htm">Psalm 37:24</a> &#8220;Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, for the LORD is holding his hand,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a> &#8220;For a righteous man falls seven times and rises again.&#8221; Falling, then, is hardship allowed by God that exposes genuine faith and refines it (<a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Granted a Little Help</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they will be granted a little help&#8230;&#8221; may seem understated, yet history bears it out. The Maccabean resistance received limited but timely military victories and sympathetic allies&#8212;enough to survive, not yet to triumph fully. God&#8217;s deliverance sometimes arrives in measured doses:<p>&#8226; Gideon&#8217;s 300 versus Midian (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s two-man assault (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>)<p>&#8226; Paul strengthened by a single angel during the storm (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23-24</a>)<p>A &#8220;little help&#8221; keeps dependence on the LORD front-and-center while proving His faithfulness in the midst of adversity (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Many Join Insincerely</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but many will join them insincerely.&#8221; Popular momentum attracts opportunists. In the Maccabean era, some aligned with the revolt for personal gain or political calculation, not covenant loyalty. Jesus warned of similar mixed crowds: the seed choked by thorns (<a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>) and followers who abandon Him when teaching grows hard (<a href="/john/6-66.htm">John 6:66</a>). The church experiences the same pressure; when affliction lessens or success looms, nominal believers surface (<a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). The verse therefore cautions us to test motives and remain watchful, knowing that not every ally is a fellow servant of God (<a href="/acts/8-13.htm">Acts 8:13-23</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-34.htm">Daniel 11:34</a> shows God&#8217;s people suffering real setbacks, receiving measured aid, and facing mixed company. The Lord permits the fall to purify faith, supplies sufficient help to sustain His remnant, and exposes shallow allegiance so true devotion stands out. Through each stage He remains sovereign, assuring ultimate victory for those who endure in sincere, wholehearted commitment to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Now when they shall fall.--</span>Referring to those who suffer during this persecution, to whichever class they belong. (See last Note). These will not be entirely without help, but there will be some small assistance given them. It will be small, either compared with their present needs, or contrasted with the great help which will be given them when the tribulation attains its greatest severity. In the Maccabee persecutions help was given to the sufferers by Judas and his brethren (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-11.htm" title="Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him, and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain, but the rest fled.">1 Maccabees 3:11</a>, &c., <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-14.htm" title="So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fled into the plain.">1 Maccabees 4:14</a>, &c.). This prevented the faithful from disappearing entirely.<p><span class= "bld">Many shall cleave. . . .</span>--Dissimulation will cause some to declare themselves upon the side of "those that understand." This is a feature which will be noticed in religious persecutions; according as one party or the other gains in power, as its prospects brighten, it gains fresh adherents. This held true in the days of Antiochus. (See <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-21.htm" title="Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, unto whom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:">1 Maccabees 6:21</a>, &c., 9:23.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And when they are crushed many shall be gathered to them in (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>) the city, even many as in distribution by lot (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)." This phrase is rendered by Paulus Tellensis (<span class="accented">poolog pesa</span>), "the division of the lots;" wrongly rendered by Bugati, <span class="accented">in hereditate.</span> The reading here is due to dropping of the reduplication in <span class="accented">heltqluqoth.</span> The Peshitta generally agrees with the Massoretic, only it renders the last clause, "Many shall add themselves to them in division, (<span class="accented">palgootha</span>)," which, however, Castelli renders in this one case as <span class="accented">simulatio.</span> When success crowned the arms of Judas and his brethren, many of the Sadducean party joined themselves to them, although formerly they belonged to the Hellenizers. This association rendered the Assidaeans dissatisfied, and resulted in disaster. Probably the reference is to nothing so far down history. When Judas began to be successful, many would join him, hoping, by a limited amount of treachery to Judas, to secure safety if the king ultimately prevailed, while at the same time, their presence with the Maccabees would save them from the vengeance of their own countrymen if Judas were successful and the Syrian yoke thrown off. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now when they fall,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;hik&#183;k&#257;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
