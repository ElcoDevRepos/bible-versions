The fulfillment of divine prophecy underscores the sovereignty of God over earthly rulers, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel. It serves as a reminder of the certainty and immediacy of God's word, as seen in other biblical instances such as the judgment on Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>He was driven away from mankind.</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's removal from human society symbolizes the loss of his royal authority and dignity. This separation reflects the consequences of pride and self-exaltation, aligning with the biblical principle that God opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). The king's isolation can be compared to the lepers in Leviticus, who were also separated due to impurity, highlighting the spiritual and social ramifications of sin.<p><b>He ate grass like an ox,</b><br>This imagery of Nebuchadnezzar eating grass signifies his complete humiliation and reduction to an animalistic state. It illustrates the drastic transformation from a powerful king to a creature dependent on the earth for sustenance. This condition parallels the judgment on King Herod in <a href="/acts/12-23.htm">Acts 12:23</a>, where divine retribution leads to a loss of human dignity.<p><b>and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven,</b><br>The mention of dew emphasizes Nebuchadnezzar's exposure to the elements, indicating his vulnerability and the absence of royal comforts. Dew, often a symbol of divine blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>), here contrasts with the king's cursed state, highlighting the reversal of fortune due to his pride.<p><b>until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle</b><br>The description of Nebuchadnezzar's hair growing like eagle feathers suggests a prolonged period of judgment, as well as a further departure from human appearance. Eagles, often symbols of strength and freedom in scripture (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>), ironically contrast with Nebuchadnezzar's captivity to his condition, emphasizing the depth of his fall.<p><b>and his nails like the claws of a bird.</b><br>The transformation of Nebuchadnezzar's nails into bird-like claws completes the picture of his dehumanization. This detail underscores the thoroughness of God's judgment and serves as a physical manifestation of the king's spiritual and moral decline. It also foreshadows the eventual restoration and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, as Nebuchadnezzar later praises the Most High (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experienced a humbling transformation due to his pride and arrogance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The kingdom over which Nebuchadnezzar reigned, known for its grandeur and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sentence.htm">The Sentence</a></b><br>The divine judgment pronounced by God through a dream interpreted by Daniel, resulting in Nebuchadnezzar's temporary insanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformation.htm">The Transformation</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's physical and mental change, symbolizing his fall from power and humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dew_of_heaven.htm">The Dew of Heaven</a></b><br>Represents the exposure and vulnerability Nebuchadnezzar faced during his period of humbling.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride can lead to a downfall, as seen in Nebuchadnezzar's life.

Of this sickness nothing is recorded by Berosus, unless the vague statement "Nebuchadnezzar fell sick and died after a reign of forty-three years" be pressed.

The verse that is placed as parallel with this in the Septuagint differs very considerably. In the LXX. this verse is still part of the proclamation of the angel, "<span class="accented">Early</span> shall all these things be completed upon thee, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Baby-Ion, and nothing shall be awanting of all these things." This verse is properly without a correspondent in the Massoretic text. The next verse resumes the proclamation, "I Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon was bound seven years, and they fed me with grass as an ox. I ate from herbs of the earth." Then after a verse which Tischen-doff marks as an interpolation, but which really is a misplaced doublet, we have a continuation of ver. 30 (33 Authorized Version), "And my hairs became like feathers of an eagle, and my nails like those of the lion, and my flesh and my heart were changed, and I walked naked with the beasts of the earth." The fact that this is longer than the Massoretic text is decidedly against it. It seems to be a para-phrastic rendering of a text somewhat similar to the Massoretic. On the other hand, the fact that it retains the first person makes it at least possible that the condensation of the middle portion of this chapter, according to the received text, is not resorted to in this recension. It is to be noted that only a very few words in the Septuagint necessitate any idea of condensation: only in the beginning of ver. 27 Septuagint (28 Aramaic, 31 Authorized Version) is there a change of persons. This verse is rendered by Theodotion in a way much like the Massoretic text. The first portion of the verse is an exact translation of the Aramaic, but at the end the' rendering is, "till his hairs grew like those of lions, and his malls as those of birds." The Peshitta agrees exactly with the Massoretic. One cannot help being suspicious of this assertion of the hair being like eagles' feathers, partly because the eagle is a bird, and "birds" are spoken of in the next clause of the verse, and further there appears to be a pun on the last portion of the king's name in the word used for "eagle" (<span class="accented">nesher</span>). The Jewish scribes were prone to have such plays on names. Early in history it occurs, as when Abigail makes use of it to David in regard to her husband (<a href="/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>), "Nabal is his name, and folly is with him." This possibly is the reason for the Hebrew variation in the name given to the Babylonian Nabu-kudur-utzur. Theodotion's version shows the result of reasoning - it is a scribe's emendation. That matted hair should have an appearance which suggested the feathers of birds, is natural enough, aria the utter inattention to matters of personal <span class="accented">cleanliness is</span> an exceedingly common symptom in cases of insanity. This personal neglect would naturally result also in the growth of the nails, and their incurring would give them vaguely the appearance of lions' claws. We can picture the Babylonian monarch that had, like his Ninevite predecessors, been finical about his curled locks and trimmed and jewelled fingers, walking in wild nakedness so far as his shackles permitted him, with hair-matted locks, and his nails misshapen and long. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that moment</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8160.htm">Strong's 8160: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brief time, moment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sentence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1488;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4406.htm">Strong's 4406: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, command, discourse, subject</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5922.htm">Strong's 5922: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was fulfilled.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1443;&#1508;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;p&#772;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5487.htm">Strong's 5487: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come to an end</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He was driven away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2957.htm">Strong's 2957: </a> </span><span class="str2">To chase away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
