His rage is a response to the defiance of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who refused to worship the golden image he had set up. This incident highlights the tension between the king's earthly power and the divine authority that the three men serve. The king's fury can be seen as a representation of the world's hostility towards those who remain faithful to God.<p><b>and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b><br>The change in Nebuchadnezzar's expression signifies a shift from favor to hostility. Previously, these men had been appointed to high positions in Babylon due to Daniel's interpretation of the king's dream (<a href="/daniel/2-49.htm">Daniel 2:49</a>). This change underscores the precarious nature of favor in a pagan court and the cost of faithfulness to God. It also foreshadows the trials believers may face when standing firm in their convictions.<p><b>He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual</b><br>The furnace, likely used for smelting metals or baking bricks, was a common feature in ancient Babylon. Heating it seven times hotter symbolizes the completeness and intensity of the king's wrath, as the number seven often represents completeness in the Bible. This act of increasing the furnace's heat serves to emphasize the severity of the punishment and the miraculous nature of the deliverance that follows. It also prefigures the trials and tribulations that believers may endure, with the assurance of God's presence and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises to be with His people through fire and water.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who becomes furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego for not worshiping the golden image he set up.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shadrach,_meshach,_and_abednego.htm">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</a></b><br>Three Jewish men who refuse to bow down to Nebuchadnezzar's golden image, demonstrating their unwavering faith in God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fiery_furnace.htm">The Fiery Furnace</a></b><br>A large furnace used for execution, which Nebuchadnezzar orders to be heated seven times hotter than usual in his anger.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_image.htm">The Golden Image</a></b><br>An idol set up by Nebuchadnezzar, representing his power and demanding worship from all his subjects.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_under_fire.htm">Faith Under Fire</a></b><br>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego exemplify unwavering faith in God, even when faced with death.

Each time, the servant&#8217;s fidelity exposes the ruler&#8217;s fury and sets the stage for divine action.<p>&#8226; Here, the narrative invites us to feel the tension: faith is not theoretical; it provokes real-world reactions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage</b><p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s wrath is not a momentary irritation but a consuming fury.

Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s escalating fury, his altered face, and the super-heated furnace reveal how far worldly power will go to uphold idolatry. Yet every detail also sets the stage for God&#8217;s unmistakable intervention. The passage calls believers to trust that when obedience provokes wrath, the Lord is fully able to turn the hottest fire into the backdrop for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">One seven times.--</span>It is doubtful whether "seven" is used here as a round number or not. According to the Babylonian mythology, there were seven demons, named "Maskim," who were the most formidable of the infernal powers. Perhaps the number "seven" has a reference to them, for the religious nature of the punishment favours the view that the overheating of the furnace was regarded as a religious act.<p><span class= "bld">Than it was wont.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">than it was fitting.</span> The improper heating of the furnace led to the death of the mighty men (<a href="/daniel/3-22.htm" title="Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.">Daniel 3:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span> The text of the LXX. is practically the same as the Massoretic, with only this exception, that "one" is omitted as unsuited to the Greek idiom. Theodotion differs more from the Massoretic - "the furnace" was to be heated "sevenfold, till it was perfectly heated (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fc6;</span>)." The Peshitta, retaining the "one," translates, "one in seven times" - a rendering which seems to have little sense, as the Syriac idiom is the same as that before us. The change of countenance, from that of gratification at seeing a favourite, to that of rage, is a perfectly natural phenomenon, but one possibly even more marked among these races then dominant over the East than among ourselves. It was certainly not unnatural that, heathen as he was, filled with the belief in the mysterious power for good or ill that might be exercised over the empire were any of the gods offended, Nebuchadnezzar should be enraged. The result is that the calmness with which he had previously spoken with the three deserts him, and the form of his face changes, his visage becomes distorted with rage. It may be noted, in passing, that the word here used, <span class="accented">ish'tanni</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), is the only case where the ethpael occurs in Daniel; in all other cases the form is hithpael, with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. Since this is so, one is inclined to credit the peculiarity to scribal change. There is a difference here between the Q'ri and K'thib, the latter reading <span class="accented">ishlannu</span>, which agrees by attraction with <span class="accented">anapolu</span>, "face," which, as in Hebrew, is plural. In order to express his wrath, he orders that the furnace be heated sevenfold hotter than ever before. The word here translated "wont to be" is really part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hezuh</span>), "to see." Behrmann renders it, "Siebenmal so stark zu heizen als man ihn heizen gesehen hatte" - "commanded it to be heated seven times as hot as ever one had seen it heated." We cannot suppose the Babylonians halt any means of measuring heat of that amount; it is simply a round number, Hitzig remarks on the recurrence of "seven," as if it helped to raise a presumption against the authenticity of the book. The fact that the Babylonians recognized seven planets, and seven gods of the planets, one for each, might as readily be taken as a proof of its authenticity. The probability is that vaguely many times more fuel was placed in the furnace than had ever been done before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1448;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
