In the Babylonian context, multiple deities were worshiped, and divine attributes were often ascribed to individuals with exceptional abilities. However, from a biblical standpoint, Daniel's wisdom and insight are attributed to the Spirit of the one true God (<a href="/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8-9</a>). This misunderstanding by Belshazzar highlights the cultural and religious differences between the Babylonians and the Israelites. The phrase also echoes earlier acknowledgments of Daniel's abilities by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-18.htm">Daniel 4:18</a>), showing a consistent recognition of Daniel's divine gifting throughout his time in Babylon.<p><b>and that you have insight</b><br>Insight here refers to Daniel's ability to understand and interpret dreams and visions, a gift from God (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>). This ability sets Daniel apart in the Babylonian court, where such skills were highly valued. Insight is a recurring theme in the book of Daniel, as it is essential for interpreting the dreams and visions that reveal God's plans for the future. This gift of insight can be seen as a type of Christ, who possesses perfect understanding and wisdom (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<p><b>intelligence</b><br>Intelligence in this context refers to Daniel's exceptional mental acuity and understanding. This is not merely human intelligence but is enhanced by divine revelation. Daniel's intelligence is demonstrated in his ability to navigate the complex political and cultural environment of the Babylonian and Persian empires. His intelligence is also evident in his ability to interpret the writing on the wall in this chapter, which none of the king's wise men could do (<a href="/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a>). This intelligence is a reflection of the wisdom that comes from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>.<p><b>and extraordinary wisdom</b><br>Extraordinary wisdom is a hallmark of Daniel's character and is repeatedly emphasized throughout the book. This wisdom is not only practical but also spiritual, allowing Daniel to discern God's will and communicate it effectively to others. The wisdom given to Daniel is reminiscent of the wisdom given to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), and it foreshadows the perfect wisdom of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). Daniel's wisdom is a testament to the power of God working through His faithful servants, and it serves as an example for believers to seek divine wisdom in their own lives (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the time of this event.

Belshazzar&#8217;s words confirm that even when rulers change, the testimony of God&#8217;s servant endures (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>- God often makes sure His faithful are spoken of in high places before pivotal moments (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>; <a href="/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the spirit of the gods is in you</b><p>- The pagan king uses his own vocabulary, yet he unknowingly points to the Holy Spirit empowering Daniel (compare <a href="/daniel/4-8.htm">Daniel 4:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>).<p>- Scripture shows the Spirit giving wisdom and boldness for specific tasks (<a href="/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>; <a href="/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>; <a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>).<p>- What Belshazzar calls &#8220;the spirit of the gods,&#8221; Paul later clarifies as the Spirit who &#8220;searches all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10-14</a>). The world may mislabel, but the Source is unmistakably divine.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that you have insight</b><p>- &#8220;Insight&#8221; speaks of discernment&#8212;the capacity to see beneath the surface (<a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22, 28</a>; 5:12).<p>- God promised Solomon similar discernment (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), and Jesus grants it to His disciples through His Spirit (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p>- Genuine insight directs attention back to God, not self (<a href="/psalms/119-99.htm">Psalm 119:99-100</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>intelligence</b><p>- Daniel&#8217;s mind was already noted at the exile&#8217;s beginning: &#8220;God gave them knowledge and skill in every kind of literature and wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a>).<p>- True intelligence is God-given (<a href="/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a>; <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>) and balanced by humility (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>).<p>- Belshazzar&#8217;s court had scholars, but none matched Spirit-filled understanding (<a href="/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and extraordinary wisdom</b><p>- &#8220;Extraordinary&#8221; sets Daniel apart: his wisdom excelled the magi &#8220;ten times&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>).<p>- Such surpassing wisdom foreshadows Christ, &#8220;in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<p>- Job reminds us that the fear of the Lord is wisdom&#8217;s foundation (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>).
