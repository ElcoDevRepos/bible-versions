This reflects their faith in God&#8217;s provision and wisdom. The concept of comparison is significant in biblical narratives, often used to highlight the difference between those who follow God and those who do not, as seen in Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21-39</a>).<p><b>with those of the young men who are eating the royal food</b><br>The royal food likely included items forbidden by Jewish dietary laws (Leviticus 11). This highlights the cultural and religious tension between the Jewish exiles and Babylonian practices. The young men eating the royal food represent those conforming to the Babylonian way, contrasting with Daniel and his friends' commitment to God's laws.<p><b>and deal with your servants according to what you see.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's proposal is a demonstration of faith and wisdom. He trusts that God will honor their obedience and make their appearance favorable. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God&#8217;s people are called to live by faith, trusting in His provision and protection, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.

Daniel expects God to honor fidelity even in something as ordinary as diet.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with those of the young men who are eating the royal food</b><p>&#8211; The &#8220;royal food&#8221; likely involved items ceremonially unclean or previously offered to idols, conflicting with <a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>.<p>&#8211; By contrasting diets, Daniel highlights the moral line between conformity to Babylon (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>) and allegiance to God.<p>&#8211; His request stresses separation without isolation; like Esther later (<a href="/esther/2-20.htm">Esther 2:20</a>), he lives in a pagan court yet maintains covenant distinctiveness.<p>&#8211; The comparison underscores two sources of sustenance: the king&#8217;s provision versus the Creator&#8217;s, reminiscent of Elijah fed by ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and deal with your servants according to what you see</b><p>&#8211; Daniel submits the outcome to the steward&#8217;s judgment, demonstrating humility and respect for God-ordained authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13-14</a>).<p>&#8211; He risks consequences, trusting that obedience is safer than compromise (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>).<p>&#8211; This clause exemplifies faith in action: obedience first, results left to God (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase &#8220;your servants&#8221; underscores their identity: servants of both the earthly official and ultimately the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/1-13.htm">Daniel 1:13</a> reveals a courageous yet courteous faith. Daniel invites a fair, observable test, trusting God to vindicate obedience through visible blessing. By contrasting diets, he draws a clear line between pagan influence and covenant fidelity, while his submissive tone models respect for authority. The verse teaches that when God&#8217;s people honor His commands, they can confidently leave the results&#8212;and their reputations&#8212;in His hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants</span>. The Septuagint Version here differs considerably from the Massoretic text; it is as follows: "And should our countenance appear more downcast than (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) those other youths who eat of the royal feast, according as thou seest good (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>), so deal with thy servants." In the text before the Septuagint translator <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">l'phaneka</span>), "before thee," is omitted, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">mareh</span>)," appearance," is read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">zo'aphim</span>), and after is inserted <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">min</span>), "from," the sign of the comparative, equivalent to "<span class="accented">than."</span> Theodotion, Jerome, and the Peshitta represent accurately the Massoretic text. Against the Septuagint reading is the fact that in the Massoretic, <span class="accented">marayeeaen is</span> construed a singular, but in <a href="/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>:10 it is plural. The vocalization of <span class="accented">tirayh</span>, "thou shalt see," is Aramaean, and therefore confirms the idea that this chapter is a translation in which the original shines through. The reading of the Septuagint implies that a different meaning must be put on the last clause from that in the English Version. It means that, should the experiment prove a failure, they were willing to suffer any punishment that the official in question saw good. Such an interference with the arrangements of the king would be a crime to be punished with stripes. Although a perfectly consistent sense can be brought from the text behind the Septuagint, yet, from the fact that the phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">zo'apheem min-hay'ladeem</span>), occurs in the tenth verse, and therefore may be repeated here by accident, we would not definitely prefer it. Further, the Massoretic text follows more naturally from the context. Let the steward see the result of the experiment after ten days, and, as he sees, so let him judge and act. Daniel and his companions leave the matter thus really in the hands of Providence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then compare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
