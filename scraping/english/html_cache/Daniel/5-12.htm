This name is derived from the Babylonian god Bel, indicating the attempt to integrate Daniel into the pagan society. Despite this, Daniel maintained his Hebrew identity and faith, serving as a testament to his steadfastness and God's sovereignty over all nations.<p><b>was found to have an extraordinary spirit</b><br>Daniel's "extraordinary spirit" refers to his exceptional character and divine wisdom. This phrase highlights the presence of the Holy Spirit in Daniel's life, enabling him to stand out among his peers. His spirit is a type of Christ, who also possessed a spirit of wisdom and understanding, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>.<p><b>as well as knowledge, understanding</b><br>Daniel's knowledge and understanding were gifts from God, allowing him to comprehend complex matters. This mirrors the wisdom given to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>) and foreshadows the wisdom of Christ, who is described as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<p><b>and the ability to interpret dreams</b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret dreams was a significant aspect of his ministry, as seen in his interpretations for Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 2, 4). This gift parallels Joseph's ability to interpret dreams in <a href="/genesis/40.htm">Genesis 40-41</a>, demonstrating God's control over future events and His communication through chosen servants.<p><b>explain riddles</b><br>The ability to explain riddles indicates Daniel's skill in solving complex and enigmatic problems. This skill is reminiscent of Solomon's wisdom in answering difficult questions posed by the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-3</a>). It underscores the theme of divine wisdom surpassing human understanding.<p><b>and solve difficult problems</b><br>Daniel's capacity to solve difficult problems reflects his role as a wise counselor in the Babylonian court. This ability is a testament to God's empowerment, similar to how God equipped Moses with wisdom to lead Israel (<a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>). It also points to Christ, who provides solutions to the deepest human dilemmas through His teachings and sacrifice.<p><b>Summon Daniel, therefore, and he will give you the interpretation.&#8221;</b><br>The call to summon Daniel underscores his reputation and reliability as a servant of God. This reflects the biblical principle that those who are faithful in small things will be entrusted with greater responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).
