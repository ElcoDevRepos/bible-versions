The "arrogant words" suggest blasphemy or defiance against God, reminiscent of the Antichrist in eschatological interpretations. This connects to <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5-6</a>, where the beast speaks blasphemies. Historically, this could allude to rulers like Antiochus IV Epiphanes, known for his persecution of the Jews and desecration of the Temple. The persistence in watching indicates the importance of vigilance and discernment in understanding prophetic visions.<p><b>As I continued to watch, the beast was slain,</b><br>The "beast" symbolizes a kingdom or empire, often interpreted as a representation of oppressive regimes throughout history. The slaying of the beast signifies divine judgment and the ultimate triumph of God's sovereignty over evil. This echoes themes found in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>, where the beast is captured and defeated. The imagery of slaying underscores the finality and decisiveness of God's intervention in human history.<p><b>and its body was destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.</b><br>The destruction and casting into the "blazing fire" symbolize complete and utter judgment. Fire is a common biblical motif for purification and judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, where eternal fire is prepared for the devil and his angels. This imagery reinforces the idea of God's ultimate justice and the eradication of evil. The finality of the beast's destruction serves as a reassurance of God's control over history and the eventual establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

The punishment of blasphemy among the Babylonians was burning. On account of the blasphemies of the little horn, the whole empire to which it belonged was destroyed. If we regard the fourth beast as Rome, and the little horn the imperial dignity, it was on account of its blasphemies that the empire really ceased. The blasphemous claim to divinity wrought madness in the minds of such youths as Caligula, Nero, Commodus, Caracalla, and Heliogabalus. The process might be a slow one. God had his purpose in the history of the race to work out by the Roman Empire; yet it was none the less the madness of the emperors that brought the empire down. The way the provinces were harried by barbarians East and West could well be described as burning the body of it with fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1488;&#1491;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
