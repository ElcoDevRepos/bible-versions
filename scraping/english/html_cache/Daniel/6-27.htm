Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as a deliverer, rescuing Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and delivering them from their enemies (<a href="/judges/6-9.htm">Judges 6:9</a>). The deliverance of Daniel from the lions' den is a testament to God's ongoing protection and faithfulness. This theme of deliverance is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is seen as the ultimate deliverer, saving humanity from sin and death (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p><b>He performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth,</b><br>The mention of signs and wonders underscores God's sovereign power over creation. In biblical history, signs and wonders often accompany God's intervention, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11) and the miracles performed by Jesus (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). These acts serve as evidence of God's authority and are meant to inspire faith and awe. The reference to both "heavens and on the earth" emphasizes God's dominion over all realms, aligning with the biblical view of God as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>).<p><b>for He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.&#8221;</b><br>This specific act of deliverance is a powerful demonstration of God's protection over His faithful servant. Daniel's rescue from the lions' den is a pivotal moment that illustrates God's ability to save against seemingly impossible odds. Historically, lions were a symbol of power and danger in the ancient Near East, making this miracle even more significant. This event prefigures Christ's victory over death, as Daniel emerges unharmed from the den, just as Jesus rises from the grave. The story of Daniel serves as an encouragement to remain faithful, trusting in God's power to deliver His people from any peril.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the Medo-Persian Empire.
