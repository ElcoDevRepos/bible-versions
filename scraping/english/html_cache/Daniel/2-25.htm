This urgency reflects the dire situation, as the king had decreed the execution of all wise men in Babylon due to their inability to interpret his dream. The haste indicates the importance of Daniel's potential revelation. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire, and the king's word was law, making Arioch's actions both obedient and strategic. Daniel's presence before the king signifies divine intervention, as God had revealed the mystery to him.<p><b>and said to him,</b><br>Arioch speaks directly to the king, which shows his role as an intermediary. In the Babylonian court, such direct communication with the king was reserved for trusted officials. This moment underscores the gravity of the situation and the hope placed in Daniel's ability to provide the needed interpretation.<p><b>&#8220;I have found a man among the exiles from Judah</b><br>Daniel is identified as one of the exiles from Judah, highlighting his status as a foreigner in Babylon. This reference to his Jewish heritage is significant, as it underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His people, even in exile. The mention of Judah connects to the broader biblical narrative of Israel's history and God's covenant promises.<p><b>who will tell the king the interpretation.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret the dream is attributed to divine revelation, not human wisdom. This sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan and the demonstration of His power over earthly kingdoms. The interpretation of dreams was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, but Daniel's insight is portrayed as superior because it comes from the God of Israel. This foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is the ultimate revelation of God's will and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Hebrew man of noble lineage, taken into Babylonian captivity.

Save that the Septuagint has again <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and Paulus Tellensis adds the adjective "wise" as a description of the man who had thus professed to satisfy the king, the versions agree with the Massoretic text. In regard to the Aramaic here, the use of the Eastern form of the haphel is to be <span class="accented">noted - hanel</span> instead of <span class="accented">ha'el.</span> These are to be looked upon as archaisms or Orientalisms, that have survived modernizing efforts of the pre-Massoretic scribes. We have already remarked on this as an Eastern peculiarity which survives in the Mandaitic and in the Babylonian Talmud. The careful way in which the Septuagint renders the particular <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, omitted in the other old versions save the Peshitta, ought to be noted as a sign of the extreme carefulness of the Septuagint translator, and a reason why we should regard divergences from the Massoretic as generally evidences of a different text. It has been remarked by Archdeacon Rose that Arioch claims too much when he asserts that he had "found Daniel." This, however, does not meet the case if the ordinary interpretation of the circumstances is right; then Nebuchadnezzar had not only seen Daniel in connection with this matter, but further, Arioch knew of it. The case of Abner and David before Saul, in <a href="/1_samuel/17-35.htm">1 Samuel 17:35</a> should not be brought in in comparison with <a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>, as the latter does not occur in the Septuagint. Unless there has been interpolation, the explanation seems to be that Arioch was not aware that Daniel had petitioned. It may be that Arioch wishes to disarm the king's wrath by not saying anything of Daniel being one of "the wise men" against whom the king's sentence had gone out; but it may also be regarded as a proof that Daniel and his companions had not yet passed out of the class of pupils into that of wise men. He says he is "of the sons of the captivity of Judah." The haste with which Arioch brings Daniel into the king's presence may be due to his own delight at having escaped a piece of employment he had no heart for. There may have been an element of anxiety - he had procrastinated, and the young king had made no inquiries; but it was not the custom of the conqueror to give orders and not to see that they were carried out, and disobedience to the orders of Nebuchadnezzar would mean instant death, possibly with torture. Every moment was fraught with danger, so Arioch's hastening of Daniel may have been due to his own sense of relief at escape from an impending danger. But more, this haste would give the appearance of eager diligence, if not in slaughtering the wise men of Babylon, at least in searching for one who could make good to the king their lack of service toward him. His haste might be intended to give the look at once of eagerness and diligence. All the motives may have combined. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Arioch</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_746.htm">Strong's 746: </a> </span><span class="str2">Arioch -- king of Ellasar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hastily</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;b&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
