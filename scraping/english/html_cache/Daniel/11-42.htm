In the context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, this is often interpreted as a prophecy concerning a powerful figure in the end times. Historically, this could be linked to rulers like Alexander the Great or Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who had vast empires. Biblically, this echoes the dominion of the Antichrist as described in Revelation, who will have authority over many nations. Theologically, it reflects the theme of human ambition and the transient nature of earthly power, contrasting with God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>and not even the land of Egypt will escape</b><br>Egypt, historically a powerful and influential nation, often symbolizes worldly strength and wealth in the Bible. The mention of Egypt here indicates that even the most formidable nations will not be immune to this ruler's reach. In the biblical narrative, Egypt frequently appears as a place of refuge and conflict for Israel, from the time of Abraham to the Exodus. This phrase may also allude to the historical conflicts between the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires, where Egypt was a significant player. Prophetically, it underscores the comprehensive nature of the prophesied ruler's control, suggesting a time of great upheaval and change, where traditional powers are subdued.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This figure is a central character in <a href="/bsb/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, representing a powerful ruler or kingdom that exerts influence over many nations.

The king has at last attained his object. He has frequently been partially successful in his attempts (see <a href="/context/daniel/11-12.htm" title="And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.">Daniel 11:12-13</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-15.htm" title="So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.">Daniel 11:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-29.htm" title="At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.">Daniel 11:29</a>), but now Egypt is completely overthrown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall stretch forth his hand also</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape</span>. The Septuagint rendering is, "And he shall send forth his hand upon the countries, and in the land of Egypt there shall not be a saviour in it." The first part of this verse is marked with an asterisk. Evidently the text before the translators had <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lah pelaytah</span>), "to her deliverance," and "deliverance" in the abstract became "deliverer" in the concrete. Theodotion renders in a different sense, "And he shall stretch his hand upon the land, and the land of Egypt shall not be for salvation." The idea here is that for the land of Palestine, Egypt shall not be a deliverer. This, probably, is the true reading. The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic pretty closely, "He shall stretch his hand over the countries, and the land of Egypt shall escape from his hands." The Vulgate has nothing to justify remark. Probably this verse, in the way it is rendered by Theodotion, is a portion of the lost vision of Daniel. The vagueness of "countries" stands in contrast to the definiteness of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and is thus suspicious. Help was always expected from Egypt in the time when Assyria and Babylonia successively claimed the subjection of the Holy Land. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will extend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his power</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over [many] countries,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and not even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will escape.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1496;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#7789;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6413.htm">Strong's 6413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Deliverance, an escaped portion</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/11-42.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 11:42 He shall stretch forth his hand also (Dan.
