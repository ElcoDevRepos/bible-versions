The king was boasting about his achievements when divine judgment was pronounced. This reflects the biblical principle that God opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>) and acts swiftly against arrogance. The suddenness of the event underscores the sovereignty of God over human affairs, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>a voice came from heaven</b><br>The voice from heaven signifies divine authority and intervention. In biblical literature, a heavenly voice often represents God's direct communication (e.g., <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a> at Jesus' baptism). This divine interruption serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over earthly rulers and kingdoms, reinforcing the message that earthly power is subordinate to divine will.<p><b>&#8220;It is decreed to you, King Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>The use of the word "decreed" indicates a formal and unchangeable decision from God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a decree from a king was binding and irrevocable, reflecting the absolute nature of God's pronouncement. Nebuchadnezzar, despite his earthly power, is subject to the decrees of the heavenly King, illustrating the theme of divine sovereignty over human authority.<p><b>that the kingdom has departed from you</b><br>This phrase marks the fulfillment of the prophetic dream Nebuchadnezzar had earlier in the chapter, where he was warned of his impending downfall due to pride (<a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24-25</a>). The loss of the kingdom is both a literal and symbolic act of divine judgment. It serves as a humbling experience for Nebuchadnezzar, intended to lead him to acknowledge God's supremacy. This event foreshadows the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where all earthly kingdoms will be replaced by God's everlasting reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who is the central figure in this chapter.

And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</span> The Septuagint rendering has many points of interest, "While the word was yet in the mouth of the king - at the end of his speech - he heard a voice out of heaven, To thee it is said, O King Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom of Babylon has been taken from thee, and is being given to another - a man set at naught in thy house: behold, I set him in thy kingdom, and thy power and thy glory and thy delicacy he takes possession of; that thou mayest know that the God of heaven hath dominion over the kingdoms of men, and to whomsoever he willeth he shall give it. To the rising of the sun another king shall rejoice in thy house and shall <span class="accented">possess</span> thy glory and thy might and thy dominion." The differences between the Massoretic and Theodotion are inconsiderable. The Peshitta adds the clause, "wet with the dew of heaven," to the description of the humiliation of Nebuchadnezzar; and to the account of the supremacy of the God of heaven adds, "and raises to it the humble man." This latter clause seems like a faint echo of the more precise statement of the LXX. The Vulgate differs here only as in the former case, omitting the causative. The reference in the LXX. to a special person in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, exalted upon his throne, appears to support an idea thrown out by Lenormant. Neri-glissar, the son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar and the <span class="accented">successor</span> of Evil-Merodach, claims to be the son of Bel-zikir-iskun, King of Babylon (Lenormant, 'La Divination,' 204), but in the list of Ptolemy there is no such name; hence Lenormant imagines that this Belzikir-iskun usurped the throne for a short while, too short to be in the canon of Ptolemy. There is no trace of such a usurpation in the contract tables. Rawlin-son's hypothesis is difficult to believe. It is that this Belzikir-iskun was king in Babylon before the fall of the Assyrian Empire, before Nabepolassar. But from the accession of Nabopolassar to the death of Evil-Merodach is sixty-five or sixty-six years. A man of the age implied was little likely to take part in a revolution or leave behind him an infant son. It is difficult to decide, but it must be admitted that Lenormant's position is at all events a possible solution of the question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While the words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mil&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4406.htm">Strong's 4406: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, command, discourse, subject</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were still</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5751.htm">Strong's 5751: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the king&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mouth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1467;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;p&#772;um)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
