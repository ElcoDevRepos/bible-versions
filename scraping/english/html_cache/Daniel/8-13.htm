In the context of Daniel, angels often serve as messengers or interpreters of divine visions. The presence of a "holy one" underscores the sacred nature of the vision and its interpretation. Angels are frequently depicted in Scripture as God's messengers, as seen in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21</a> and <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>.<p><b>and another holy one said to him</b><br>The dialogue between two holy ones suggests a heavenly council or discussion, emphasizing the importance of the vision. This mirrors other biblical instances where divine beings confer, such as in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>. The interaction highlights the complexity and significance of the vision, requiring divine insight for understanding.<p><b>&#8220;How long until the fulfillment of the vision</b><br>This question addresses the timing of prophetic events, a common concern in apocalyptic literature. The inquiry reflects a desire for understanding God's timeline, similar to the disciples' question in <a href="/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>. The emphasis on "fulfillment" indicates that the vision is part of God's sovereign plan, awaiting completion.<p><b>of the daily sacrifice</b><br>The daily sacrifice refers to the continual offerings made in the Jerusalem Temple, central to Jewish worship and covenant relationship with God. The interruption of these sacrifices signifies a severe disruption in religious practice, as seen during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the Temple (1 Maccabees 1:41-64).<p><b>the rebellion that causes desolation</b><br>This phrase points to a specific act of defiance against God, resulting in desolation. Historically, this is linked to the abomination of desolation prophesied in <a href="/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a> and referenced by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>. It symbolizes profound spiritual and physical desecration, often associated with idolatry and persecution.<p><b>and the surrender of the sanctuary</b><br>The surrender of the sanctuary indicates a loss of control over the holy place, leading to its defilement. This event is historically tied to the desecration of the Second Temple by foreign powers. The sanctuary's surrender is a recurring theme in biblical prophecy, symbolizing judgment and the need for eventual restoration (<a href="/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20-22</a>).<p><b>and of the host to be trampled?&#8221;</b><br>The "host" likely refers to God's people, Israel, who suffer oppression and persecution. The imagery of trampling conveys severe affliction and subjugation, reminiscent of the oppression under Antiochus IV and later Roman persecution. This phrase echoes the trials faced by the faithful, as seen in <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>, and points to the ultimate hope of deliverance and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_ones.htm">Holy Ones</a></b><br>These are likely angelic beings, possibly Gabriel and another unnamed angel, who are discussing the vision given to Daniel. Their conversation highlights the divine interest and involvement in the unfolding of prophetic events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision.htm">Vision</a></b><br>The vision refers to the prophetic revelation given to Daniel, which includes the cessation of the regular sacrifice and the desecration of the sanctuary.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/regular_sacrifice.htm">Regular Sacrifice</a></b><br>This is the daily offering made in the Jewish temple, which is central to the worship practices of Israel. Its cessation signifies a major disruption in religious life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/transgression_that_causes_desolation.htm">Transgression that Causes Desolation</a></b><br>This phrase refers to a significant sin or rebellion that leads to the desecration of the temple, often associated with the actions of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a historical figure who desecrated the Jewish temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanctuary_and_host.htm">Sanctuary and Host</a></b><br>The sanctuary is the holy place of worship, and the host likely refers to the people of God or the angelic forces associated with them. Both are subjected to being "trampled," indicating persecution and desecration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_timelines.htm">Understanding Prophetic Timelines</a></b><br>Recognize that God's prophetic timeline is precise and purposeful.

The &#8220;holy one&#8221; is therefore understood literally as an angel.

God answers with a precise timetable, assuring that every trial is measured and temporary. Historically fulfilled under Antiochus IV, the verse also foreshadows a final period of tribulation when similar events will reoccur. Through it all, the passage reassures believers that heaven is engaged, evil is limited, and ultimate restoration is certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">One saint--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, an angel, who, however, has not been mentioned before.

Probably these words mean the same as the "abomination that maketh desolate" (<a href="/daniel/11-31.htm" title="And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.">Daniel 11:31</a>; <a href="/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>; see <a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-59.htm" title="Now the five and twentieth day of the month they did sacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.">1 Maccabees 1:59</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under</span> <span class="cmt_word">foot?</span> Our Authorized rendering is clearly mistaken; it ought not to be "saint," but "holy one," as in the Revised Version. The versions leave <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, "a certain one," untranslated. Fust's suggestion, held also by Behrmann, is that this is a contraction for <span class="accented">paloni almoni.</span> The renderings of the versions are worthy of note. The LXX., "And I heard one holy one speaking, and another holy one said to Phehnouni who spoke, How long shall the vision stand, and the removed sacrifice, and the sin of desolation given, and the holy place be desolate to be trodden underfoot (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> Here the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall stand," is supposed by Professor Bevan to be an addition by one who did not fully comprehend the sentence. Following Gratz, Professor Bevan suggests a word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">mooram</span>), "removed," to explain the presence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="accented">a</span> suggestion that appears well-founded. His further suggestion, that <span class="accented">sim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>), "to set up," has been read instead of <span class="accented">shomaym</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>), must be due to inattention to the Greek. In it there is nothing about "set up," unless he transfers <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> from its place in the beginning of the sentence to the middle, and changes it to the active voice. Equally extraordinary is the suggestion that the translators read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>. The truth is, the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is probably due to a gloss or a confluence of readings. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Septuagint, save in the last clause, which he renders, "And the sanctuary and the power be trodden underfoot." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, "And I heard a holy one who spake, and a holy one said to <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, who spake, When shall the vision of the perpetuity (daily sacrifice?), and of sin and of corruption be completed, and the holy place and the host be trodden underfoot?" The translators must have read <span class="accented">shahata</span> instead of <span class="accented">shomaym.</span> "Completed," <span class="accented">nesh-tlem</span>, may have been added, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Greek, but the fact that all the versions have a word not represented in the Massoretic would indicate the probability that something has dropped out. Some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Greek Version, whereas some portion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Peshitta. Daniel hears one of those watching angels who desire to look into the evolution of the Divine purpose concerning man and his salvation, asking another, "How long shall be the desolation of Jerusalem under Epiphanes?" The irregular construction here suggests corruption. We would render the speech of the angel, "How long - the vision, the sacrifice - the sin of desolation to give the sanctuary and the service to be trodden underfoot?" as if Daniel had only heard snatches of what was said; we would, we may say, omit the "and" before "sanctuary." The Septuagint translators may have omitted <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), thinking only of its ordinary meaning, "host," forgetful of the fact that it is used of the temple service in <a href="/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>. These angels are most interested in the length of time that the sanctuary shall remain desolate. This may indicate that it was evident, from the vision, that the period of desolation was a limited one. The scene presented to the imagination is striking. The seer, as he gazes on the vision appearing to him over the marsh at Susa, hears angelic voices that direct attention to what was most important to him and to his people. To the Israelites of the period of the Maccabees, the length of time that the temple service would be in abeyance was of the highest importance. It was well that they should know that the time was shortened for the elect's sake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#353;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
