The role of a prophet or interpreter in ancient times was significant, as they were seen as mediators between the divine and human realms. Daniel's ability to interpret dreams is a gift from God, as seen earlier in the book (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19-23</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of divine revelation and the responsibility of the prophet to convey God's message accurately.<p><b>and this is the decree that the Most High has issued</b><br>The term "Most High" refers to God, emphasizing His supreme authority over all earthly rulers. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a> and <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>. The use of "decree" indicates a formal and unchangeable decision, highlighting the seriousness of the message. In the ancient Near East, decrees from a king or deity were considered binding and authoritative.<p><b>against my lord the king:</b><br>Daniel shows respect for Nebuchadnezzar by referring to him as "my lord," despite the impending judgment. This reflects the biblical principle of respecting authority (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>). The phrase "against my lord the king" indicates that the message is one of judgment, a common theme in prophetic literature. This judgment serves as a warning and a call to repentance, similar to other biblical narratives where God warns leaders and nations of impending consequences if they do not turn from their ways (e.g., <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel (Belteshazzar)</a></b><br>A Hebrew prophet and interpreter of dreams, known for his wisdom and faithfulness to God.

Like Joseph before Pharaoh, he knows &#8220;interpretations belong to God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>) and must be delivered exactly as received.<p>- The word &#8220;interpretation&#8221; reminds us that God does not leave His messages in riddles; He clarifies them for those who seek Him (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>).<p>- For us, it underscores the reliability of Scripture: when God explains something, that explanation is final and trustworthy (<a href="/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O king</b><p>- Daniel addresses Nebuchadnezzar respectfully, even though he must announce severe judgment. Obedience to God never excuses rudeness toward authority (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>).<p>- His tone models how believers can speak truth to power&#8212;firm in conviction, gracious in delivery (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p>- The respectful address also highlights that earthly rank is real but secondary; the coming message will show who truly sits on the throne (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and this is the decree</b><p>- Daniel is not offering advice or a possibility; he announces a settled decree. God&#8217;s decisions are &#8220;established forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>) and cannot be overturned (<a href="/job/23-13.htm">Job 23:13</a>).<p>- This phrasing shifts the conversation from human politics to divine sovereignty. The Babylonian legal system is mighty, yet God&#8217;s word outranks every earthly statute (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>- It prepares the king&#8212;and us&#8212;to receive the outcome as certain, not negotiable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the Most High has issued</b><p>- &#8220;Most High&#8221; (El Elyon) emphasizes God&#8217;s supremacy over every throne (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/83-18.htm">Psalm 83:18</a>).<p>- By using this title, Daniel reminds the king that his power is delegated; heaven rules even over Babylon.<p>- The same truth reassures believers that no modern ruler acts outside God&#8217;s oversight (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Our confidence rests in the throne above all thrones.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against my lord the king</b><p>- The decree is &#8220;against&#8221; Nebuchadnezzar&#8212;divine judgment for pride displayed in verse 30. God &#8220;opposes the proud&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>- Judgment here is personal: the king himself will live like a beast (<a href="/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a>). Sin always has personal consequences, even for the powerful (<a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21-23</a>).<p>- Yet the phrase &#8220;my lord&#8221; shows Daniel&#8217;s continued loyalty and concern. Truth spoken in love seeks restoration, not mere condemnation (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a> sets the stage for God&#8217;s sovereign judgment on Nebuchadnezzar. With respectful boldness, Daniel declares that the Most High has issued a non-negotiable decree against the king&#8217;s pride. The verse reminds us that God alone interprets history, rules over rulers, and disciplines those who exalt themselves. Trust the certainty of His word, speak it with grace, and remember that every earthly authority answers to the throne in heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Which is come upon.--</span>See Note on <a href="/daniel/4-13.htm" title="I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;">Daniel 4:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king</span>. The passage in the Seventy which is parallel with this is partly in the last clause of the previous verse and partly in the verse that occupies a similar place to this in the Septuagint text, "The judgments of the great God shall come upon thee, and the Most High and his angels assail thee (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f72;</span>)." The change of tense here indicates that the second clause is an alternative rendering, brought into the text from the margin. In this marginal note <span class="accented">meta</span> has been taken as "assail," and <span class="accented">malka</span>, "O king," has been, by transposition of the two final letters, read <span class="accented">mela'k</span>, "angel." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The respectful tone in which Daniel addresses Nebuchadnezzar in the received text is to be observed; it is utterly alien to the boastful tone Judaism was afterwards accustomed to impute to its old saints. That there is no reference to the watchers or to their decree in this is imputed to Daniel's recognition of its true source; but in the Septuagint there is nothing equivalent to the statement in ver. 17. The fact that it is omitted here confirms the suspicion against it which we expressed in regard to the earlier verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the interpretation,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;i&#353;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6591.htm">Strong's 6591: </a> </span><span class="str2">An interpretation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and this is the decree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1456;&#1494;&#1461;&#1512;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;z&#234;&#183;ra&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">A decree</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that the Most High</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;il&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5943.htm">Strong's 5943: </a> </span><span class="str2">highest', a name of God</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has issued</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4291.htm">Strong's 4291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrive, extend, happen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5922.htm">Strong's 5922: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4756.htm">Strong's 4756: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord -- lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/4-24.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 4:24 This is the interpretation O king (Dan.
