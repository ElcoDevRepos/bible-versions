This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter divine revelations, such as Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>) and John in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>). The overwhelming nature of the vision underscores the gravity and complexity of the prophetic message. Daniel's illness may also symbolize the burden of understanding and conveying God's future plans for His people.<p><b>Then I got up and went about the king&#8217;s business.</b><br>Despite his exhaustion, Daniel resumes his duties, demonstrating his commitment and responsibility. This phrase highlights Daniel's role in the Babylonian and Persian courts, serving under kings like Nebuchadnezzar, Belshazzar, and Darius. His ability to balance his spiritual calling with his secular responsibilities exemplifies the integration of faith and work. Daniel's faithfulness in his duties is a testament to his character and integrity, which is further emphasized in <a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4</a>.<p><b>I was confounded by the vision; it was beyond understanding.</b><br>Daniel's confusion and inability to fully comprehend the vision indicate the complexity of prophetic revelation. This aligns with the nature of apocalyptic literature, which often contains symbolic imagery and requires divine interpretation. The vision in <a href="/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8</a> involves the ram and the goat, representing the Medo-Persian and Greek empires, respectively. Daniel's struggle to understand foreshadows the need for divine insight, as seen when the angel Gabriel later provides interpretation (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16-17</a>). This phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme that God's ways and plans are often beyond human understanding, as stated in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.

The sheer weight of this revelation drains him physically: &#8220;I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for days&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Similar reactions appear elsewhere when humans encounter the holy:<p>&#8211; Daniel after an earlier vision: &#8220;My thoughts terrified me, and my face grew pale&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>).<p>&#8211; Ezekiel sat stunned for seven days after his inaugural vision (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>).<p>&#8211; John &#8220;fell at His feet as though dead&#8221; when he saw the exalted Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; These accounts remind us that Scripture records literal events; divine revelation can overwhelm the body as well as the mind. God&#8217;s holiness and future judgments are not abstractions&#8212;they touch real people in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then I got up and went about the king&#8217;s business</b><p>&#8226; After days of weakness Daniel rises and resumes his governmental duties. His faithfulness in the secular realm mirrors earlier descriptions: &#8220;Daniel distinguished himself&#8230; because an excellent spirit was in him&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-3.htm">Daniel 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical lessons flow from his example:<p>&#8211; Obedience is not postponed until we feel strong; we serve amid weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Spiritual insight should deepen earthly responsibility. Like Joseph who managed Pharaoh&#8217;s affairs after dream interpretation (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46-49</a>), Daniel lets revelation fuel diligent service.<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s dual role&#8212;prophet and administrator&#8212;shows that public work and private devotion are compatible when both are offered to God (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was confounded by the vision; it was beyond understanding</b><p>&#8226; Although Gabriel explained the vision, Daniel still &#8220;was confounded&#8230; it was beyond understanding.&#8221; Prophetic truth often contains layers whose full meaning unfolds over time.<p>&#8226; Compare <a href="/daniel/12-8.htm">Daniel 12:8</a>, where he again admits, &#8220;I heard, but I did not understand.&#8221; The humility to confess limits is itself wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; God reserves ultimate clarity for the end: &#8220;Now we see but a dim reflection&#8230; then we shall see face to face&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). Until then, believers trust that &#8220;the revelation awaits an appointed time&#8230; it will surely come&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s perplexity underscores that the vision&#8217;s fulfillment&#8212;Medo-Persia, Greece, Antiochus IV, and the shadow of a still-future antichrist&#8212;extends beyond his lifetime. Yet the prophetic word stands certain, even when the prophet himself cannot trace every thread (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a> records the aftermath of a staggering revelation: physical collapse, responsible recovery, and lingering bewilderment. The verse teaches that divine truth can overwhelm yet not incapacitate; believers may be shaken, but they rise to serve. It also reminds us that some mysteries remain until God&#8217;s appointed time, calling us to humble trust while we labor faithfully in our present assignments.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</span> The Septuagint omits "fainted," but otherwise agrees with the above. Theodotion evidently has lind the Massoretic text before him; but he has not understood, and has slavishly rendered it word for word. The Peshitta represents also a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes. Jerome also agrees with the received text; he renders the last clause, non <span class="accented">erat qui interpretaretur.</span> That Daniel should faint, and remain sick for days - "many days," says the LXX. - is quite in accordance with what we might imagine to be the natural effect of intercourse with the spiritual world. The mental strain and the intense excitement incident upon such an occurrence would necessarily produce a reaction. <span class="accented">Afterward I rose up</span>, <span class="accented">and did the king's business.</span> We have no distinct evidence of what the business was that took Daniel to Susa, if he was there in reality, and not merely in vision; but we may surmise that it was about the advance of Cyrus Elam and Media were both embraced in the dominion of Cyrus very early. Cyrus had overthrown the Umman-Manda, and delivered Babylon. At that time there seems to have been somewhat of a <span class="accented">rapprochement</span> between Nabu-nahid and Cyrus; but at the time before us, Cyrus must have begun to realize his destiny, and possibly would not be easy to on. at with. Daniel may have been plenipotentiary of Babylon at the court of Cyrus, endeavouring to secure a treaty. At the same time, aware that Croesus, the rival of Cyrus, might be called in, he continues the negotiation. <span class="accented">I was astonished at the vision</span>, <span class="accented">but none understood it.</span> The idea of the word translated "astonished" is "benumbed;" it may be exegetic of the first clause, explaining the cause of the fainting and subsequent sickness. It is clear that Daniel did not regard the command "to guard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">satham</span>) the vision" as implying that he should keep it secret. We see, as we said above, that his complaint is that no one understood the vision. Behrmann maintains that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">maybeen</span>), "to understand," ought to be translated "marked," "observed," but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> would be the natural verb to use in such a connection, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. Hitzig explains this by saying, "He had imparted the vision to no one." If Daniel had indulged in statements of float kind, the word before us would not have inaugurated a new form of literature. Professor Bevan's interpretation is as farfetched, "And I was no understander thereof." The example he brings forward of ver. 5 is not to the purpose, because the distinction between the first person and the third is too great.
