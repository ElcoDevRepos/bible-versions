The palace represents a place of authority and power, yet it becomes a place of inner turmoil for the king. The king in question is Darius, ruler of the Medo-Persian Empire, who had reluctantly ordered Daniel to be thrown into the lions' den due to the irreversible decree he had signed. This moment reflects the king's personal conflict and the limitations of his power, as he is unable to save Daniel despite his high status.<p><b>and spent the night fasting.</b><br>Fasting in this context is a sign of distress and earnestness. It was not common for a king to fast, as they typically indulged in the luxuries of their position. This act of fasting indicates the king's deep concern for Daniel, whom he respected and valued. Fasting is often associated with seeking divine intervention or expressing repentance and humility before God, as seen in other biblical accounts such as <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-9</a>. The king's fasting suggests a recognition of a higher power at work, even if not explicitly stated.<p><b>No entertainment was brought before him,</b><br>Entertainment in the royal court would have included music, dancers, or other forms of amusement to please the king. The absence of entertainment signifies the king's preoccupation and inability to find joy or distraction in his usual pleasures. This decision underscores the gravity of the situation and the king's emotional state. It also highlights the contrast between the king's usual life of ease and the current crisis, emphasizing the seriousness of Daniel's predicament.<p><b>and sleep fled from him.</b><br>The phrase indicates the king's anxiety and unrest, as he is unable to find peace or rest. This sleeplessness reflects his troubled conscience and concern for Daniel's fate. In biblical literature, sleeplessness often accompanies moments of divine intervention or significant events, as seen in <a href="/esther/6.htm">Esther 6:1</a> when the king's insomnia leads to the discovery of Mordecai's unrewarded loyalty. The king's inability to sleep suggests an anticipation of a divine outcome, aligning with the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_darius.htm">King Darius</a></b><br>The ruler of the Medo-Persian Empire who had reluctantly ordered Daniel to be thrown into the lions' den due to the manipulations of his officials.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the kingdom, known for his unwavering devotion to God, which led to his persecution.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_palace.htm">The Palace</a></b><br>The royal residence of King Darius, where he spent a restless night after Daniel was cast into the lions' den.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lions'_den.htm">The Lions' Den</a></b><br>A pit or enclosure where Daniel was thrown as a punishment for praying to God, defying the king's decree.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_night_of_distress.htm">The Night of Distress</a></b><br>The event where King Darius experienced a sleepless night, filled with anxiety and concern for Daniel's fate.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_burden_of_unrighteous_decisions.htm">The Burden of Unrighteous Decisions</a></b><br>King Darius's sleepless night illustrates the inner turmoil that can accompany decisions made under pressure or manipulation.

By retreating, fasting, refusing entertainment, and losing sleep, Darius shows sincere grief and reluctant faith that Daniel&#8217;s God can overrule the irrevocable edict. The verse illustrates how God unsettles the powerful to accomplish His purposes, sets the stage for Daniel&#8217;s deliverance, and reminds believers that no human decree can thwart the living God who watches over His faithful servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Instruments of musick.--</span>A word of very doubtful meaning. The root whence it is derived means <span class= "ital">to rejoice,</span> but what is signified cannot be exactly ascertained.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king went to his palace. and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</span> In the Massoretic text one of the clauses, "Neither were instruments of music brought before him," has caused great difficulty. The word <span class="accented">dahvan</span>, translated "instruments of music," is rendered by Furst, "dancing-girl; "Gesenius, "concubine; "Rosenmuller renders, "odours." The Mediaeval Greek Version translates, "instruments of music." Furst speaks with favour of the Syriac rendering, "food-tables." <span class="accented">Han'ayl</span>, the aphel of '<span class="accented">eilal</span>, has to be noted as a sign of antiquity. The version of the Septuagint is very wide from the Massoretic in the latter part of the verse, "Thus the king returned to his palace, and went to bed fasting, being grieved about Daniel." It is evident that the Septuagint translator had before him <span class="accented">deheel</span> instead of <span class="accented">dohvan</span> - <span class="accented">nun</span> in the script of Egyptian Aramaic is very like <span class="accented">lamed</span> in the later mode writing, as also <span class="accented">yodh</span> and <span class="accented">vav</span>. It is possible that the name "Daniel" was read <span class="accented">han'eel or</span>, <span class="accented">vies versa</span>, as two of the letters are identical If we can accept the Septuagint reading, the difficulty of this mysterious <span class="accented">dahoun</span> disappears. Another clause is added here in the Septuagint from ver. 22 (23) Massoretic, though with variations. "Then the God of Daniel, taking thought for him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) closed the mouths of the lions, that they did not hurt Daniel." This statement is not inserted in Daniel's answer to the king in the Septuagint, as it is in the Massoretic text. It would almost seem that our present text in both cases is a condensation of a more extended document. This view receives support from the rendering of Theodotion, "And the king departed to his house, and went to bed supperless, and viands were not brought to him, and his sleep went from him, and God closed the mouths of the lions, and they did not hurt Daniel." It will be seen that the last clause here agrees with the concluding clause of the Septuagint. The mysterious word <span class="accented">dahvan is</span> rendered here "food" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) - a version that is suspicious from the fact that it merely repeats, under another form, the statement that the king went to bed fasting. It is supported by the Peshitta and the Vulgate. This difference can scarcely be due to a various reading. Otherwise the Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic text. The king's sorrow and humiliation could not be better pictured than it is here: even the feast of the palace had no pleasure for him, he was so grieved about Daniel. But we must also bear in mind that fasting had among the Jews, and, indeed, in the East generally, a relationship to prayer (see <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, where fasting takes the place of prayer; see also <a href="/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). It means also repentance (<a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6-8</a>).
