In biblical context, this transformation signifies God's sovereignty over human pride and intellect. The change in mind reflects a humbling process, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>, where God gives people over to a depraved mind when they reject Him. This transformation is a direct consequence of Nebuchadnezzar's arrogance and serves as a warning against pride.<p><b>and let him be given the mind of a beast</b><br>The transformation into a beastly mind symbolizes a complete loss of human dignity and reason, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment. This imagery is consistent with other biblical instances where God uses animals to convey messages or judgments, such as Balaam's donkey in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>. Theologically, it underscores the idea that without God, humans can descend into a state of chaos and irrationality. This also prefigures the ultimate restoration and redemption found in Christ, who restores humanity to its intended state.<p><b>till seven times pass him by</b><br>The "seven times" likely refers to a period of seven years, a number often associated with completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week in Genesis. This duration signifies a complete cycle of judgment and restoration. Theologically, it points to God's perfect timing in dealing with human affairs and His ability to restore after a period of discipline. This period of judgment parallels the concept of a sabbatical year, where the land rests, symbolizing a time of renewal and dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experiences a humbling transformation as a result of his pride and arrogance.

This is more than a mood swing; it is a sovereign overhaul of his thought processes. &#8226; The Lord has always reserved the right to redirect human minds (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3&#8211;6</a>). &#8226; In the larger context of <a href="/bsb/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>, the king&#8217;s dream warns that unchecked pride meets divine opposition (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). &#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s mental shift is a mercy&#8212;discipline designed to lead him to genuine humility (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from that of a man</b><p>The text assumes that normal human reasoning carries the dignity of being made in God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26&#8211;27</a>). Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s reasoning, however, is trapped in self-exaltation (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>). &#8226; By stripping him of ordinary discernment, God exposes the emptiness of human pride (<a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>). &#8226; The contrast between a sound human mind and what follows underscores how far the mighty king must fall before he will look up (<a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and let him be given the mind of a beast</b><p>The Lord exchanges royal brilliance for animal instinct. &#8226; Daniel later recalls, &#8220;He was driven away from mankind, and his mind became like that of an animal&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/5-21.htm">Daniel 5:21</a>), confirming literal fulfillment. &#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;beast&#8221; imagery for those who refuse to honor God (<a href="/psalms/73-22.htm">Psalm 73:22</a>). &#8226; The humiliation matches Babylon&#8217;s idolatrous symbol&#8212;winged lions&#8212;turning its king into the very creature he exalted. &#8226; This drastic measure vividly illustrates that &#8220;those who walk in pride He is able to humble&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>till seven times pass him by</b><p>The judgment has a set limit. &#8226; &#8220;Seven&#8221; frequently marks completeness in Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/26-18.htm">Leviticus 26:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>). &#8226; Daniel interprets the period as literal years (<a href="/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a>), indicating God&#8217;s timetable for repentance. &#8226; Nebuchadnezzar remains under discipline until he &#8220;raises his eyes toward heaven&#8221; and acknowledges that &#8220;the Most High rules the kingdom of men&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34&#8211;35</a>). &#8226; God&#8217;s purposeful duration matches His character: just, measured, and redemptive (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a> reveals a deliberate, measured act of God: He replaces Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s proud human intellect with an animal mind for seven years to shatter the king&#8217;s arrogance and showcase divine sovereignty. The episode teaches that no earthly greatness exempts anyone from God&#8217;s authority, yet His discipline always aims at restoration for those who will finally look up and confess that &#8220;all His works are true and His ways are just&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) Here the metaphor of <a href="/daniel/4-15.htm" title="Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:">Daniel 4:15</a> is entirely discontinued, and a man is mentioned.<p><span class= "bld">Seven times.</span>--On the use of the number "seven" see Note on <a href="/daniel/3-19.htm" title="Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.">Daniel 3:19</a>. The period intended by "time" is very uncertain: from the use of the word in <a href="/judges/17-10.htm" title="And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and your victuals. So the Levite went in.">Judges 17:10</a> it has been inferred that "years" are intended. This is purely conjectural. It is more probable that the word is used to signify some definite period of time, which, as appears from the words "over him," was in some way marked out by the heavenly bodies. The word "time" is used by Daniel in the same sense (<a href="/daniel/7-25.htm" title="And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.">Daniel 7:25</a>). (Comp. <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm" title="And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and swore by him that lives for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.">Daniel 12:7</a>, where, however, a different word is employed.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">his heart be changed from</span> <span class="cmt_word">man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass ever him.</span> The Septuagint rendering seems to be taken from the previous verse, "And let his body be changed by the dew of heaven, and let him be pastured with them seven years." It seems difficult to imagine, either, on the one hand, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">libebayh</span>) changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">pi</span>g<span class="accented">erah</span>), the word by which Paulus Tellensis translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, though it suggests "carcase," or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nid nayh</span>), the word used in <a href="/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>; or, on the other, that either of these should be read <span class="accented">lebab.</span> At the same time, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unlike in old inscriptions, nor <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>; any indistinctness in the third letter might easily lead to a mistake. It is not impossible that some of the words in the latter part of the previous verse have been modified from some word meaning "body." It is equally difficult to guess what word has been read by the Septuagint translator instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yah-lephoon</span>), "let them pass over." The greater brevity of the Septuagint is in its favour. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic; he renders <span class="accented">min-anaosha</span> or <span class="accented">anosha</span>' for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "from men" - a possible translation, and one favoured by some recent commentators. The Peshitta agrees quite with the received text. According to the received text, the main change was mental - the human heart is removed, and the heart of a beast given. On the other hand, in the twenty-third verse, in which we have the fulfilment of the dream, the change is mainly physical, and it is to be observed that the change is produced by "the dew of heaven." <span class="accented">Seven times.</span> The word '<span class="accented">iddanun</span>, "times," is a matter of some difficulty; it means really "seasons" or "points" of time, as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, Targum, and <a href="/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>, Targum Onkelos, "It came to pass at this time." It is purely arbitrary to fix the meaning here as "years," as is done by the Septuagint and by many commentators. Theodotiom keeps the indefinite<span class="accented">ness</span> of the original by rendering the word here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. The Peshitta transfers the word. It may be" months" as suggested by Lenormant; it maybe "seasons," in our usual sense of the word. Rendel Harris's 'Biblical Monuments,' p. 73, says, "Summer and winter are the only seasons counted in Babylonia;" if so, seven '<span class="accented">iddaneen</span> would be nearly four years. From the fact that exposure to weather is the point of importance, Mr. Harris's view is not impossible; but pathological reasons suggest "months" (see Excursus at the end of chapter). <span class="accented">Seven</span>, with the Babylonians, as with most other Semites, is a round number of sacred import, and therefore may not be pressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let his mind</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1492;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;&#7687;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
