In the context of <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>, King Nebuchadnezzar is making a public declaration following a miraculous event. Decrees were often inscribed on tablets or scrolls and distributed throughout the empire.<p><b>that the people of any nation or language</b><br>Babylon was a vast empire encompassing many nations and languages, reflecting its diversity. This phrase underscores the universal scope of the decree, emphasizing that it applies to all subjects of the empire, regardless of their ethnic or linguistic background. This mirrors the inclusivity seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>who say anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego</b><br>The focus here is on the God of the Hebrews, who has just demonstrated His power by delivering the three men from the fiery furnace. This reflects a shift in Nebuchadnezzar's understanding, acknowledging the supremacy of their God. The phrase highlights the importance of reverence for God, akin to the commandment against taking the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p><b>will be cut into pieces and their houses reduced to rubble</b><br>This severe punishment reflects the harsh justice system of the time, where blasphemy against a recognized deity could result in extreme consequences. It also shows the king's attempt to enforce respect for the God of the Hebrews through fear, a common tactic in ancient governance.<p><b>For there is no other god who can deliver in this way</b><br>This statement acknowledges the uniqueness and power of the God of Israel, who has just performed a miraculous deliverance. It echoes the biblical theme of God's unmatched ability to save, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death in a way no other can (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

Having been confronted with the living God&#8217;s power, Nebuchadnezzar moves immediately from astonishment to legislation, as he did earlier when Daniel interpreted his dream (<a

Nebuchadnezzar issues a universal decree forbidding blasphemy against the Lord and enforces it with the harsh penalties typical of his era. His reason is simple and profound: no other god can save as the God of Israel has just saved. The verse underscores God&#8217;s unmatched power, His concern for His name among all nations, and the catalytic witness of believers who stand firm under trial.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>29<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">Anything amiss.</span>--The marginal version is to be preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> <span class="cmt_word"> The versions agree with the Massoretic text here, only that all put the crime, "speaking anything amiss," more strongly than we find it in the Massoretic recension, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> is amended by the Massoretes to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "erroneous," whereas the Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>.

The Peshitta renders ," to blaspheme." Hitzig has suggested that the K'thib here is to be preferred to the Q'ri, maintaining that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> means "word," while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> really means "inadvertence." Certainly, if we were sure that the meaning he gives to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> is correct, and the versions all support it, we would give the preference to it. It has, however, to be borne in mind that, in the notions of heathenism, intentional disrespect was not taken into consideration in regard to the gods. The intention of the worshipper was of very little moment in such a matter; he might even desire to be specially respectful to the deity he worshipped; but if, by inadvertence, he omitted something, or did something which was not according to rule, all the good will and respect in his mind was nothing - the wrath of the insulted deity was poured out in full measure, unless some other deity regarded the action in question as specially honouring to him. It was the external action - the mere form of words - that was the important matter with the polytheist. Idolatry is by its very nature a mental and moral disease; it is as absurd to expect logically concatenated actions from an idol-worshipper in regard to his deities, as to expect the same from a madman in regard to his craze. We must guard against imagining that the decree was against blasphemy as a crime against Jehovah. Primarily it was against words that, by exciting the wrath of Jehovah, might bring down damage on the empire. Nebuchadnezzar was not jealous for the honour of Jehovah, but for the safety of the Babylonian supremacy. The punishment threatened, it may be observed, is the same as that decreed against the wise men because of their failure to tell the dream and its interpretation. In regard to this, in <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> the Septuagint renders the phrase, "Ye shall be made an example of, and your goods shall be escheat to the king's treasury." This change, as we maintained, was due to a difference of reading, not to any objection to the harshness of the phrase. The object of the punishment here was to remove utterly from the earth the wrong-doer and every remembrance of him, so that the offended deity might have no excuse for visiting the kingdom of Babylon with judgments. The reason, "because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort," is not to be stretched too far. All that is asserted is that no other god has been able to deliver his worshippers out of the very realm of the god of fire, and therefore it is to be argued that his power of offence is as great; hence all are to avoid enraging him; but there is no worship enjoined. The Lagid princes, when Jerusalem was in their hands, ordered sacrifices to be offered on their behalf daffy. Nebuchadnezzar does nothing of this sort; his decree is simply negative <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
