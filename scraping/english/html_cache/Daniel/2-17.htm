His return to his house signifies a place of refuge and fellowship amidst a foreign land. This setting highlights the importance of community and support among believers, especially in times of trial. The house may have been a simple dwelling, reflecting the humble circumstances of the exiles.<p><b>and explained the matter</b><br>The "matter" refers to King Nebuchadnezzar's dream and the subsequent decree to execute the wise men of Babylon, including Daniel and his friends, if the dream and its interpretation were not revealed. Daniel's action of explaining indicates his role as a leader and mediator. It underscores the importance of communication and shared understanding in facing challenges. This also reflects the biblical principle of seeking counsel and wisdom from trusted companions.<p><b>to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b><br>These three friends, also known by their Babylonian names Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, were fellow exiles and companions of Daniel. Their Hebrew names reflect their faith and identity in God: Hananiah means "Yahweh is gracious," Mishael means "Who is what God is?" and Azariah means "Yahweh has helped." Their friendship exemplifies the strength found in godly relationships and mutual support. This group of friends is later tested in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3), demonstrating their unwavering faith. Their unity and shared faith serve as a type of the church, the body of Christ, where believers support one another in faith and prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A young Jewish exile in Babylon, known for his wisdom and ability to interpret dreams.

Having secured that window, he heads straight home, demonstrating orderly trust rather than panic (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even in exile Daniel keeps a household. <a href="/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5</a> urged the captives to build houses and settle; Daniel obeys, living responsibly while waiting for God&#8217;s deliverance (cf. <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God&#8217;s people returning to a familiar safe place after crisis: Peter and John &#8220;went to their own people&#8221; in <a href="/acts/4-23.htm">Acts 4:23</a>. Such retreats are not escapism but strategic pauses for prayer and counsel (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and explained the matter</b><p>&#8226; Daniel does not shoulder the burden alone. He &#8220;explained&#8221; (v. 18 adds the purpose: &#8220;so that they might seek mercy from the God of heaven&#8221;). Transparency invites joint intercession (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Wise communication replaces anxiety with purpose. By laying out the facts he transforms fear into a prayer agenda, echoing <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>.<p>&#8226; God often involves a team before revealing a mystery (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Daniel understands that divine insight is given to bless the wider covenant community, not to elevate one individual (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</b><p>&#8226; These three companions&#8212;later known as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>)&#8212;share Daniel&#8217;s uncompromising faith.

The four young men form a miniature prayer meeting, foreshadowing <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>, where the early church waited together for revelation.<p>&#8226; This verse introduces a storyline of corporate faithfulness that culminates in chapter 3 when these same friends face the furnace, proving that shared devotion today equips us for tomorrow&#8217;s trials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a> shows a purposeful retreat, clear communication, and covenant community. After securing time from the king, Daniel goes home, lays out the crisis, and enlists trusted friends for united prayer. The verse models calm faith, wise transparency, and the strength found in godly companionship&#8212;keys for every believer facing impossible situations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions</span>. There is nothing in the versions that calls for remark here, save that the Septuagint seems to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, "all," or some such word, instead of <span class="accented">mill'tha.</span> Alter having got his petition granted, to all appearance easily, Daniel now proceeds to his own house. As during the period of their education the four friends had formed one "mess" in the hall of Nebuchadnezzar, and it is probable had one table set apart to them, so when in college - if we may use the phrase - they occupied one apartment or set of apartments. Their life in the matter of food was simple and abstemious, and it is little likely that they would require extensive accommodation. Having got the reprieve he had petitioned for, Daniel now informs his friends of it. We have assumed that the news of the royal decree had reached the college where, among other students and soothsayers of as yet lesser grade, Daniel and his friends abode; in that case, he would merely have to inform them how he had sped with Arioch. and how he had further presented a petition to the king tbr a time to be set when he should answer the king's request, and how he got what he desired. It may, however, have been that Daniel had alone heard the dreadful news, and then acted so that his companions heard only of the threatened disaster when they heard of the mode of escape. It is to be observed, in passing, that the names of the friends are given in the Hebrew, not in the Babylonian form. Alone with each other, we may imagine they used the old Hebrew names of their childhood. Now especially would the sacred tongue be present to their lips and their thoughts when the cloud of a great danger hung over them. It was as Jews, members of the holy people, that they could appeal for help and deliverance to Jehovah the God of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Daniel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;n&#238;&#183;y&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1841.htm">Strong's 1841: </a> </span><span class="str2">Daniel -- 'God is my judge', an Israelite leader in Babylon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1494;&#1463;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;zal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_236.htm">Strong's 236: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, go off</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to his house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;ay&#183;&#7791;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
