In the context of ancient Near Eastern monarchies, a decree from the king was absolute and irrevocable. The king's word was law, reflecting the autocratic nature of Babylonian rule. This decree was a response to the failure of the wise men to interpret the king's dream, highlighting the king's frustration and the high stakes of court life.<p><b>that the wise men were to be executed</b><br>The wise men, including magicians, enchanters, and astrologers, were considered the intellectual elite of Babylon. Their inability to fulfill the king's demand led to a death sentence, illustrating the perilous nature of their positions. This reflects the broader theme of divine wisdom versus human wisdom, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>, where human wisdom is contrasted with God's wisdom.<p><b>and men went to look for Daniel and his friends</b><br>Daniel and his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were among the Jewish exiles brought to Babylon. They had been trained in the ways of the Babylonians but remained faithful to their God. This search for Daniel and his friends underscores their inclusion among the wise men, despite their distinct faith and practices. It also sets the stage for Daniel's role as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of others.<p><b>to execute them</b><br>The intent to execute Daniel and his friends highlights the severity of the situation and the imminent danger they faced. This moment of crisis serves as a backdrop for God's intervention, demonstrating His sovereignty and protection over His faithful servants. It foreshadows the deliverance themes found throughout the book of Daniel and parallels the deliverance found in Christ, who saves from ultimate judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

out</b><p>&#8220; &#8216;So the decree went out&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-13.htm">Daniel 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s word immediately becomes law&#8212;an example of absolute monarchy similar to later &#8220;laws of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents this as a literal royal order, underscoring how swiftly earthly power can threaten life (<a href="/esther/3-13.htm">Esther 3:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows the decree, yet remains fully sovereign (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). The stage is set for Him to showcase His wisdom over Babylon&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the wise men were to be executed</b><p>The states, &#8220;&#8230;that the wise men were to be executed&#8230;.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Failure to satisfy the king&#8217;s impossible demand (<a href="/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5&#8211;11</a>) brings a death sentence. Pagan wisdom proves empty (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel and his friends, though faithful to God, are counted among &#8220;the wise men&#8221; because the king included all categories of advisers (<a href="/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This crisis highlights the contrast between human wisdom and divine revelation (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and men went to look for Daniel and his friends</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and men went to look for Daniel and his friends&#8230;&#8221; (v. 13).<p>&#8226; Executioners begin house-to-house searches, reminiscent of Saul seeking David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>) or Herod searching for the Christ child.<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s earlier faithfulness (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8&#8211;17</a>) does not exempt him from trial; instead, it prepares him for it (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people often find themselves swept into the world&#8217;s crises, positioning them to testify to His power (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to execute them</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to execute them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The threat is real and imminent, yet not final.

The verse exposes the bankruptcy of pagan wisdom, the fragility of life under human rulers, and the sovereignty of God who uses crises to display His supremacy. What looks like a hopeless decree becomes the very avenue through which the Lord reveals the dream, spares His people, and proclaims His unmatched wisdom to a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain.</span> As the Aramaic stands, it might be translated as does Professor Fuller, "And the decree went forth, and the wise men were being slain;" the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> of co-ordination maybe regarded as here used of Subordination. Further, the use of the participle for the preterite is not by any means uncommon in Daniel, certainly mainly in the principal clause, as in ver. 5 of the present chapter. Noldeke, in his 'Syriac Grammar,' 278<span class="accented">a</span>, gives examples of the passive participle being used as here in the subordinate clause. The Septuagint is very condensed, but possibly drawn from a similar text, only such extreme condensation is unlike the translator elsewhere. It is possible that some part of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>. (<span class="accented">peqad</span>), "to decree," was used, perhaps the participle hithpael. It is possible that the verb <span class="accented">qetal</span> was in the infinitive. Theodotion renders, "And the decree went forth, and the wise men were slain." This, though a possible translation, does not fit what we find represented to be the circumstances, as ver. 24 seems to assume that the wise men were not yet destroyed. On the other hand, it would be hardly possible to imagine the king allowing these wise men who had refused to answer his question, to go out of his presence in safety and unbound. It would seem more natural to imagine that they were carried off to prison, and that all the soothsaying class were intended to be gathered together in prison, in order that the vengeance of the king might be more appallingly manifest. The sentence looks at first sight to us as too savage to be true, but just as savage proofs of vengeance were given by Asshurbanipal. <span class="cmt_word">And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain</span>. The Septuagint translation of this clause is somewhat paraphrastic, "And Daniel was sought for and all those with him in order to be put to death." The want of an antecedent to fix the nominative of the verb probably led to the sentence assuming its present mould; but "all" seems to have no word to occasion it. Theodotion follows the Massoretic text closely; so also does the Peshitta. It is clear from this that Daniel and his companions had not been summoned into the royal presence when the question concerning the dream was put to the wise men. This would seem to contradict the statement of <a href="/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>, "Therefore stood they" - to wit these Hebrew youths <span class="accented">-</span> "before the king." Their position was probably like those who had passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service - they are accepted, but they have still a season of study, and then, after they go out to India, they occupy only subordinate situations at first. While permited to enter the ranks of the soothsayers and astrologers to the court, they were placed at first only in the lower grades, and would have to rise by degrees, and in ordinary circumstances a long time would elapse before they would be summoned into the immediate presence of the sovereign. On the reading of the LXX., Daniel and his friends would not, because they were Jews, and not Chaldeans. One has only to turn to the Talumdic tales to see how unlike this reasonable position is to the ordinary Jewish fictitious narrative. The Book of Daniel is not nearly prodigal enough in wonders to be a representative of the Jewish Midrash. It is further clear that the decree of the king went beyond those who had actually been in his council-chamber on that merest-able day. The idea of the king probably was that the treason which he had found in the heads of the various classes of Chaldean soothsayers would have permeated all the members. Babylonian and foreign, as well; therefore he orders them all to suffer a common fate. Wieseler's hypothesis, that this event took place close to the end of the three years of study which had been assigned to these youths, would suit the statement of events which we find here; although it is not necessary, yet on this assumption, the succession of events as narrated in this chapter becomes perfectly natural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the decree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
