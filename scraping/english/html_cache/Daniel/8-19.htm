Gabriel is one of the few angels named in the Bible, often associated with delivering important messages from God, as seen in <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19, 26</a>-27 when he announces the births of John the Baptist and Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;Behold,</b><br>The term "behold" is used to draw attention to the importance of the message. It is a call for Daniel to pay close attention, indicating the significance and urgency of the revelation that follows.<p><b>I will make known to you</b><br>Gabriel is about to reveal divine knowledge to Daniel, emphasizing the role of prophecy in understanding God's plans. This aligns with the biblical theme that God reveals His plans to His prophets, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>.<p><b>what will happen in the latter time of wrath,</b><br>This phrase refers to events that will occur in the future, specifically during a period of divine judgment or wrath. The "latter time" suggests an eschatological focus, pointing to the end times. This period is often associated with the tribulation described in Revelation, where God's wrath is poured out on the earth.<p><b>because it concerns the appointed time of the end.</b><br>The "appointed time" indicates that these events are part of God's sovereign plan and will occur at a specific, predetermined time. This reflects the biblical theme of God's control over history and His ability to bring His purposes to fulfillment, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>. The "end" refers to the culmination of history, a time when God's kingdom will be fully established, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> and <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision and interpretation.

It reads, "on the children of thy people." It may have been inserted from <a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, only it is used in such a different sense that that does not seem very likely.

On the other hand, its omission from Theodotion and the Peshitta is not so easily intelligible. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is more brief, practically omitting the last clause. We have here the reference to the end, as in ver. 17 it is not the end of the world that is in the mind of the writer, but the "end of the indignation." The Jews, while maintaining their gallant struggle against Epiphanes, have need of being assured that the battle will have an end, and one determined before by God, The angel has to make Daniel know the end of the indignation. It may be said that the present time, when Israel has neither country nor city, is one of indignation; but the immediate reference is to the persecution against the Jews inaugurated by Epiphanes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
