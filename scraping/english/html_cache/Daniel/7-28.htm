The phrase indicates a sense of finality and completeness, suggesting that what has been revealed is both comprehensive and authoritative. In biblical context, "the matter" refers to the vision of the four beasts and the Ancient of Days, which symbolizes God's sovereignty over human history.<p><b>As for me, Daniel,</b><br>Here, Daniel personalizes the account, emphasizing his role as the recipient of the vision. Daniel is a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his wisdom and faithfulness in exile. His personal involvement underscores the gravity of the vision and its impact on him. Daniel's experiences in Babylon, serving under various kings, provide him with a unique perspective on the rise and fall of empires, which is central to the vision.<p><b>my thoughts troubled me greatly,</b><br>Daniel's reaction to the vision is one of deep distress and concern. This reflects the overwhelming nature of the revelation, which includes terrifying images and profound implications for the future. The troubling thoughts may also stem from the vision's depiction of persecution and suffering for God's people, as well as the eventual triumph of God's kingdom. This emotional response highlights the seriousness of prophetic visions and their impact on the prophets who receive them.<p><b>and my face turned pale.</b><br>The physical reaction of turning pale indicates fear and anxiety, common responses to divine revelations in the Bible. This reaction underscores the intensity of the vision and its effect on Daniel's well-being. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such a physical response would be understood as a natural reaction to encountering the divine or receiving a message of great significance.<p><b>But I kept the matter to myself.&#8221;</b><br>Daniel's decision to keep the vision to himself suggests a period of contemplation and reflection. This may indicate the need for discernment and understanding before sharing the revelation with others. In the broader biblical narrative, there are instances where prophets are instructed to seal or keep certain revelations until the appointed time. This phrase also highlights the personal burden that prophetic insight can place on the prophet, as they grapple with the weight of divine messages.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Old Testament, known for his faithfulness to God amidst exile in Babylon.

<a href="/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226;It reminds us that prophetic insight is not given for curiosity but carries moral weight, calling us to repentance and readiness (cf. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my face turned pale.</b><p>&#8220;and my face turned pale.&#8221;

<a href="/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226;By waiting on God&#8217;s timing, Daniel ensures the message will accomplish its intended purpose among future generations (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Daniel&#8217;s closing words reveal the finality, authenticity, and weight of the vision.
