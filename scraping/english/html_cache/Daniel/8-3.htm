The act of lifting one's eyes often signifies a divine revelation or insight beyond the natural realm.

The Medo-Persian Empire was known for its vast power and influence, which is reflected in the imagery of the long horns.<p><b>but one was longer than the other,</b><br>This detail highlights the dominance of the Persian part of the empire over the Median. Historically, the Persians, under Cyrus the Great, became more prominent and powerful than the Medes, which is depicted by the longer horn.<p><b>and the longer one grew up later.</b><br>The later growth of the longer horn indicates the rise of Persian dominance after the initial establishment of the Medo-Persian alliance. This aligns with historical accounts where the Persians, initially less prominent, eventually overshadowed the Medes in power and influence.

The ram was standing before the river, or eastward of it, and represented the Medo-Persian empire (<a href="/daniel/8-20.htm" title="The ram which you saw having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.">Daniel 8:20</a>). The two horns, like the two breasts and arms of the image, or the two sides of the bear, symbolise the twofold character of this empire. The higher horn denotes the Persians, the dominant race.

As in the former verse, <span class="accented">oobal</span> is translated "gate." Certainly, as before remarked, "<span class="accented">before</span> a river" is an awkward combination; "<span class="accented">before"</span> or "<span class="accented">over against a</span> gate" is intelligible. "Eastward," which <span class="accented">liphnee</span> also means, will not suit the geographical circumstances, as Shushan itself stood on the east bank of the river Eulaeus, or Shapur. If, further, <span class="accented">oobal</span> means a "marsh," as Jerome renders it, then "eastward" would not suit. for the existing marsh is to the south-west of Shushan. Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, but does not translate (<span class="accented">oobal</span>, he merely transliterates it. The Peshitta is in strict agreement with the text of the Massoretes. Jerome, as we just said. in this verse renders <span class="accented">oobal</span> by <span class="accented">paludem.</span> Daniel in his vision seems looking from the walls of the citadel of Shushan, most likely even now the capital of the triumphant young conqueror. The progress of the arms of Cyrus would no doubt be viewed with apprehension by the court of Babylon. Daniel's thoughts would be naturally filled with the new factor in the polities of the Euphrates valley. Hence it was not unnatural that the thoughts of the (lay should colour the visions of the night. The choice of the animal - the ram - to represent the Medo-Persian monarchy is by some supposed to be illustrated by the figures of goats and rams on Persian cylinders. If it has any special meaning, it probably is that the monarchy had sprung up among a pastoral people. It is maintained by Professor Bevan, that this figure of a ram with two horns proves that there were two successive empires - a Median and a Persian. If Mr. Bevan would use his ingenuity, and show us any way by which the actual facts of the history and constitution of the Medo-Persian Empire could be represented in a symbol that would not be liable to his misinterpretation, it would be an advantage. The empire, we know, was built up by two races - the race which last came into prominence became the predominant. Here in the symbol before us the unity of the empire is exhibited by the animal being one, and the two races are indicated by the two horns. The duality of the symbol ought to be noted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I lifted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
