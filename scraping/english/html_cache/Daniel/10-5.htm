The dress especially recalls to our minds the clothing of the high priest. (See <a href="/context/exodus/39-27.htm" title="And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,">Exodus 39:27-29</a>, and comp. <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13</a>.) The person himself is carefully distinguished from Michael (<a href="/daniel/10-21.htm" title="But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.">Daniel 10:21</a>), and as we may infer from Daniel's silence (comp. <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm" title="Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.">Daniel 9:21</a>), he is distinct from Gabriel also. He is the same man who stood before Daniel (<a href="/daniel/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.">Daniel 8:15</a>), and must be regarded as "the Angel of God" (<a href="/exodus/32-34.htm" title="Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.">Exodus 32:34</a>), or "God's Presence" (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm" title="And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.">Exodus 33:14</a>), or "God's Name;" in fact, the One who was the Logos. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphas: his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude</span>. The version given by the Septuagint exhibits traces of confluence, "And it was [apparently reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayyehee</span>)] on the four and twentieth day of the first month, I was upon the bank of the great river Tigris, and I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man clothed in fine linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), and girt about the loins with fine linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), and from his middle there was light, and his month was as the sea, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, his arms and feet as gleaming brass, and the voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span>) of his speech as the voice of a multitude." It would seem that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> twice; that might be due to blunder, or may be a case of doublet - a phenomenon so frequent. The difficult word <span class="accented">Uphaz</span>, which only occurs elsewhere in <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>, is omitted; "from his middle there was light" is probably an effort to render this clause, which the translator seems to have read <span class="accented">mithoq 'or</span>. Possibly the mysterious clause, "and his mouth was like the sea," may be another attempt to render these unaccustomed words. Theodotion merely transliterates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and regards <span class="accented">Uphaz as a</span> garment, which, in the case before us, was golden (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). In the Syriac of the Peshitta, the translator escapes the difficulty of <span class="accented">bad</span>, <span class="accented">deem</span> by rendering it "glory." The next clause is also paraphrastic, "the girdle of his loins (back) was of splendid magnificence:" this last is his rendering of <span class="accented">Uphaz.</span> The next verse does not call for remark. Jerome, in the Vulgate, renders <span class="accented">tarsheesh </span>as <span class="accented">chrysolithus</span> - an interpretation very generally followed now. In the Massoretic text, the use of the numeral "one," almost as our indefinite article, has to be noted. <span class="accented">Baddeem is</span> the plural of a word used mainly for the material of which the garments of the priests were made; it occurs also in the vision of Ezekiel. The singularity is that in Ezekiel, as in Daniel, the word is always plural whereas in the rest of Scripture it is always singular. <span class="accented">Uphaz</span> occurs, as above mentioned, only in <a href="/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>; it is by some supposed to be a variation on Ophir. As here, it is connected in Jeremiah with Tarshish. F&uuml;rst suggests <span class="accented">paz</span>, "fine gold" (<a href="/job/28-17.htm">Job 28:17</a>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. "coast or island," thus making it equivalent to "<span class="accented">Gold</span> Coast." <span class="accented">Kethem</span>, "fine gold," is associated in <a href="/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a> with "Ophir," as here with" Uphaz;" this might hint at the identity of the two places. That, however, is an uncertain basis. The fact that Tarshish and Uphaz are brought together, would indicate that, like Tarshish, it was in Spain. Kneucker, in Schenkel's 'Bibellexikon,' decides for Hy-phasis, South Arabia, on the uncertain ground of the sound of the name. Bochart would place it in Ceylon, because Ptolemy mentions a harbour and river of the name of Phasis. Tarshish is the Tartessus of the Greeks and the modern Tharsis; here the chrysolite or topaz, as brought from thence. <span class="accented">Margelothayo</span>, "his feet," is the most common rendering; but yon Lengerke would render, "the place where his feet rested" - a rendering which, while it suits the form of the word, does not suit the context. It occurs four times in Ruth in one connection, and not elsewhere, save here. "Like in colour to polished brass" is a phrase which occurs in <a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>. Professor Bevan says, "What meaning the author attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qalal</span>),' 'polished,' it is impossible to say." All the versions render" gleaming," in both passages; there seems no need to suggest a corruption of the text. The vision here has a great resemblance, though with many pointsof contrast, to <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-25</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>. Many passages in the Apocalypse show traces of its influence: thus <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14, 15</a>, the appearance of our Lord; also <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-3</a>. The vision in <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. is a theophany; this, however, is not the appearance of a direct symbol of God, but the appearance of one of his angels. The whole aspect is one of terror and splendour. It has been noted that the yellow gleam of the topaz suits well the tint of the Oriental complexion. When we compare this with Ezekiel's vision, we find a reticence in Ezekiel's description; he does not affirm (<a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>) that it is a man he sees, but only one in human likeness. Whereas Daniel distinctly says that it was a man. In the case of Ezekiel, it was a theophany which he saw; it was an angelophany which appeared to Daniel. "The voice of a multitude" refers to the sound of the shout of a multitude; the effect it produces is not merely the volume of sound, but the difference of tones and the difference of moment of utterance give a sense of vastness and multitudinousness, always impressive, and indeed awe-inspiring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I lifted up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my eyes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;nay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
