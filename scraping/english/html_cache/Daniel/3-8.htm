The context is the dedication of the golden image set up by the king, as described earlier in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>. This event occurs after the conquest of Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish people to Babylon, a significant period in Jewish history known as the Babylonian Captivity.<p><b>some astrologers came forward</b><br>Astrologers, also known as Chaldeans, were part of the king's advisory council. They were considered wise men and were often consulted for their supposed ability to interpret dreams and signs. In the Babylonian culture, astrology was a respected science, and these individuals held significant influence. Their coming forward suggests a deliberate action, possibly motivated by jealousy or political maneuvering.<p><b>and maliciously accused the Jews</b><br>The accusation against the Jews was not merely a legal complaint but was driven by malice. The Jews, including Daniel and his friends, had been elevated to positions of authority in Babylon, which may have caused resentment among the native Babylonian officials. This accusation is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God's people face false charges, such as Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 39) and Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>). The term "maliciously" highlights the intent to harm, reflecting the spiritual battle between God's people and those opposed to His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A group of astrologers and wise men in Babylon who were often consulted by the king for their knowledge and interpretation of dreams.

(Comp. <a href="/daniel/5-11.htm" title="There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar your father, the king, I say, your father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;">Daniel 5:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Chaldeans.</span>--Not to be confused with the astrologers mentioned in <a href="/daniel/2-5.htm" title="The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.">Daniel 2:5</a>, but Chaldean native subjects, contrasted with the Jewish colonists spoken of at the end of the verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</span> The Septuagint is in this verse closer to the Massoretic than is Theodotion.

It occurs in the Syriac of <a href="/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1</a>; it is in the Targum of <a href="/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a>. The Vulgate presents no points worthy of notice. It is evident that "Chaldean" is here used in its ethnic sense of the nation, not in its professional sense as of the alleged class. We must remember that "Chaldean" is not equivalent to "Babylonian." As we have seen, the Chaldeans were intruders in Babylon, and to them Nebuchadnezzar belonged. It was but natural that native-born Chaldeans, who reckoned <span class="accented">themselves</span> to be of the same kin as the king, objected to have their rights postponed to a set of Jews. The fact that the three friends are not named, or in any way designated, but the whole Jewish race is referred to, shows that the purpose of these Chaldeans involved the whole Jewish people, and that they singled out Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego simply as test cases. Their elevation to positions Of such trust might well have caused jealousy of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At this time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1836.htm">Strong's 1836: </a> </span><span class="str2">This</span><br /><br /><span class="word">some astrologers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#347;&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chaldeans -- a Chaldaean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came forward</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;ri&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7127.htm">Strong's 7127: </a> </span><span class="str2">To approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and maliciously</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1445;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;a&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_399.htm">Strong's 399: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat, devour</span><br /><br /><span class="word">accused</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(qar&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;h&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7170.htm">Strong's 7170: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chew him up, by slander</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Jews,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1497;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;y&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3062.htm">Strong's 3062: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jews -- inhabitants of Judah</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/3-8.htm">Daniel 3:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/3-8.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 3:8 Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came (Dan.
