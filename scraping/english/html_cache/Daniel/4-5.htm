Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king, experienced a dream that caused him great fear. This reflects the belief that dreams could foretell future events or divine judgment. The fear indicates the seriousness of the dream's content, suggesting a message of significant consequence. In biblical context, dreams are frequently used by God to communicate with individuals, as seen with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> and Pharaoh in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>while I was in my bed,</b><br>The setting of the dream is significant. The mention of being in bed suggests a time of vulnerability and rest, a common time for divine revelations in the Bible. This setting emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of the dream experience. In the cultural context, beds were places of rest and reflection, and receiving a dream in such a setting underscores its importance and the personal impact it had on Nebuchadnezzar.<p><b>the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.</b><br>The use of "images and visions" indicates a vivid and possibly symbolic dream, which is a common feature in biblical prophecy. The alarm caused by these visions suggests a message of warning or impending judgment. This aligns with other biblical instances where God uses dreams to convey urgent messages, such as with Daniel's own visions in later chapters. The alarm felt by Nebuchadnezzar can be seen as a precursor to the interpretation that Daniel will later provide, which reveals God's sovereignty and the king's need for humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who has a troubling dream.

Here, God interrupts the king&#8217;s comfort to expose his need for grace.<p>- The setting also contrasts human ease with divine urgency: while the king rests, God acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the images and visions in my mind alarmed me</b><p>- The dream&#8217;s vivid &#8220;images and visions&#8221; intensify the fear. Daniel later experiences similar distress: &#8220;I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit&#8230; and the visions of my head troubled me&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>).<p>- Such mental pictures are God-engineered to penetrate the conscience (<a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>).<p>- <a href="/luke/24-37.htm">Luke 24:37</a> shows that even the disciples were &#8220;startled and frightened&#8221; by a sudden vision; divine revelation regularly shakes people loose from complacency.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-5.htm">Daniel 4:5</a> records the moment God interrupts Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s comfortable night with a divinely sent dream that fills him with fear. The verse highlights four facts: God speaks literally through dreams, His messages produce holy fear, He can reach us in our most private spaces, and His vivid revelations expose the heart. Together these truths set the stage for the king&#8217;s humbling and for God&#8217;s sovereign glory to be displayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I had</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2370.htm">Strong's 2370: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gaze upon, mentally to dream, be usual</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a dream,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#234;&#183;lem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2493.htm">Strong's 2493: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and it frightened me;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1491;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1425;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;lin&#183;na&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
