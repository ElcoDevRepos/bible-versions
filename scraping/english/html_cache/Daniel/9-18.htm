It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of petitioning a deity, emphasizing the personal relationship between Daniel and God. The use of "incline Your ear" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting that God is being asked to listen attentively. This echoes other biblical prayers, such as Solomon's prayer in <a href="/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>, where he asks God to hear the supplications of His people. It underscores the belief in a God who is both transcendent and immanent, capable of hearing and responding to human cries.<p><b>open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your name.</b><br>Here, Daniel refers to Jerusalem, the city chosen by God to bear His name, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>. The "desolation" points to the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC, a pivotal event in Jewish history. This destruction was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). The phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the city represents God's dwelling place among His people. The plea for God to "see" suggests a desire for divine intervention to restore the city, reflecting the hope found in prophecies of restoration, such as those in <a href="/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>.<p><b>For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts,</b><br>Daniel acknowledges the unworthiness of the people, recognizing that their current plight is due to their sins and not because of any merit on their part. This humility is consistent with the biblical theme that human righteousness is insufficient for earning God's favor, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, which describes human righteousness as "filthy rags." This confession aligns with the broader biblical narrative of grace, where God's actions are not based on human merit but on His character.<p><b>but because of Your great compassion.</b><br>The appeal to God's "great compassion" is central to the theology of grace and mercy found throughout the Bible. This compassion is a key attribute of God, as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God is proclaimed as "compassionate and gracious." Daniel's reliance on God's compassion rather than human righteousness reflects the understanding that salvation and restoration are acts of divine grace. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where salvation is described as a gift of God's grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The emphasis on God's compassion also points to the hope of redemption and restoration, which is ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a man of prayer, Daniel is interceding for his people, Israel, and the desolate city of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord to whom Daniel directs his prayer, appealing to His compassion and mercy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that bears God's name, currently in desolation due to the people's sin and subsequent exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the Israelites were taken captive to Babylon, a result of their disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire where Daniel and the Israelites are exiled, representing a place of judgment and foreign domination.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercessory_prayer.htm">The Power of Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Daniel's prayer demonstrates the importance of interceding for others, especially in times of national or communal crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/appealing_to_god's_character.htm">Appealing to God's Character</a></b><br>Our prayers should be grounded in the nature of God&#8212;His compassion, mercy, and faithfulness&#8212;rather than our own righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_our_unworthiness.htm">Acknowledging Our Unworthiness</a></b><br>Recognizing our own sinfulness and unworthiness is crucial in approaching God, as it shifts the focus from self to God's grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_confession.htm">The Importance of Confession</a></b><br>Confession is a vital part of prayer, acknowledging our failures and seeking God's forgiveness and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_desolation.htm">Hope in Desolation</a></b><br>Even in times of desolation and despair, there is hope in God's compassion and the possibility of restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_9_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 9:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_18_God_s_mercy_vs_our_deeds.htm">How does Daniel 9:18 emphasize God's mercy over our righteousness in prayer?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Confession_s_role_in_Daniel_9_18_prayer.htm">What role does confession play in Daniel's prayer in Daniel 9:18?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_not_by_our_deeds_daily.htm">How can we apply "not because of our righteous acts" in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_18_and_Ephesians_2_8-9_link.htm">How does Daniel 9:18 connect with Ephesians 2:8-9 on grace and faith?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_9_18_reveal_about_God.htm">What does "Your great compassion" in Daniel 9:18 teach about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_18_God_s_mercy_vs_human_deeds.htm">What does Daniel 9:18 reveal about God's mercy versus human righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Daniel_9_18_Deeds_vs_God_s_favor.htm">How does Daniel 9:18 challenge the concept of earning God's favor through deeds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_highlight_God_s_compassion_in_Dan_9_18.htm">Why does Daniel emphasize God's compassion in Daniel 9:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_daniel_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Daniel 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_do_the_70_sevens_in_daniel_9_mean.htm">What do the seventy sevens in Daniel 9 mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_original_sin_align_with_accountability.htm">How does the concept of original sin in Genesis 3 align with teachings on personal accountability in later Scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_2_kings_10_align_with_mercy.htm">How can the depiction of divine judgment in 2 Kings 10 be reconciled with later passages emphasizing mercy and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_god's_rule_with_oppression.htm">How can we reconcile God's ultimate kingship with the continuing oppression seen throughout history?

The sole ground for his request&#8212;and for ours&#8212;is the LORD&#8217;s great compassion. God hears, sees, and acts to uphold His glory and to extend mercy to repentant people who trust Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy Name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord. hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God; for thy city and thy people are called by thy Name</span>. The version of the Seventy differs but little from the Massoretic; they read "hear me" instead of simply "hear." The translator also connects the "desolation "with the city, against grammar. The LXX. adds, "Be propitious to us (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." The repetition of the vocative in the nineteenth verse is omitted, but "Zion" and "Israel" are inserted after "city" and "people" respectively. Theodotion is in yet closer agreement with the received text. The Peshitta is very close, but adds "ruin" to "desolation." The Vulgate affords no cause of remark. <span class="accented">Our desolations.</span> The word used here occurs in Lamentations. In the prophecies of Jeremiah a cognate word is used, differing from that before us only in vocalization (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>, where it is applied to Babylon after the seventy years of Babylonian rule are ended). <span class="accented">Which is called by thy Name.</span> This phrase is used repeatedly in <a href="/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>. of the temple. <span class="accented">Present our supplications.</span> The words used suggest the posture in presenting a petition - falling down before the person to whom it is addressed. It is one frequently used in Jeremiah, sometimes of persons (<a href="/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>), of God (<a href="/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>). <span class="accented">Not on account of our righteousnesses.</span> There is a marked advance in spiritual insight exhibited by this. The old position was reward according to righteousness, and mercy because of it<span class="cmt_word">.</span> The Jews before the Captivity had very much the heathen idea of paying God by sacrifice for benefits received or asked; but the long cessation of sacrifice raised them above this. <span class="accented">But for thy great mercies.</span> This plea to God because in the past he has multiplied his mercies, is in the same elevated plane. We find a similar line in <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>, only as an occasion of thanksgiving. It is remarked by Professor Fuller that the repetition of the word <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, and the short sentences, give a feeling of intensity to the prayer suitable to the circumstances. The words used are all echoes of Jeremiah; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "forgive," "hearken," are used in connections that would suit Daniel's study of Jeremiah. It is impossible not to observe to how great an extent this prayer is coloured by Jeremiah. <span class="accented">Excursus on Baruch and Daniel.</span> Professor Ewald, in his 'History of Israel' (v. 206), and afterwards in his 'Prophets of Israel,' emphasizes the resemblance between the opening chapters of the apocryphal Book of Baruch and the ninth chapter of Daniel. After, in the first place, arbitrarily assigning Baruch to the Persian period, he assumes a tendency to rebel against the Persians - a thing of which we have no evidence. Certainly we have no proof against this, because we have no history of the period at all. He assumes that there was constant communication between the Jewish community in Jerusalem and that in Babylon during this period, which, though possible, is not certain. The further assumption, however, that the Babylonian Jewish community would take such a cumbrous device as the apocryphal Book of Baruch to convey their advice to the Jews of Jerusalem, to avoid rebellion, is a strange one for a man of Ewald's acuteness. By the introductory hypothesis in the Book of Baruch, the Jewish community of Babylon send a letter by Baruch to the remnant of the Jews in Jerusalem. If that were so, then it is in Jerusalem, not in Babylon, that this letter, or a copy of it, might be supposed to turn up. Therefore the <span class="accented">falsarius is</span> to be looked for among the Jews of Jerusalem, not among those of Babylon. In Jerusalem would, of necessity, the farce of finding this epistle be enacted. Altogether, there seems no support for the date or origin assigned by Ewald to this book. Of course, if we could have assumed the conclusion of Ewald in regard to the date of Baruch to be correct, it would have been of advantage in our further argument. Ewald further assumes that the opening portion of Baruch has been the original from which the prayer in the ninth chapter of Daniel has been imitated. The resemblance cannot be denied, the question to be decided is - Which is the original and which the imitation? It is a general rule, and one of almost universal application, that the shorter form of a poetical composition - and the prayer in Daniel and in Baruch has that character - is the more original. Unquestionably, if we apply this test, the prayer in the Book of Baruch is later than the parallel prayer in <a href="/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>. In Baruch the prayer occupies at least sixty verses, in Daniel only sixteen. We would not press the mere fact of brevity, did this stand alone as evidence for the priority of Daniel, as it is possible, but we think little more than barely possible, that the version in Daniel might be a summary of that in Baruch, though summaries are much rarer in poetic literature than expansions. The nature of the differences seem more naturally to be due to expansion than to summarizing. Thus if we compare two closely parallel passages (Bar. 2:9-12 and <a href="/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14, 15</a>), we find the differences are all due to expansions in Baruch on changes that might appear to make the succession of thought easier. Of the latter, an example is" works which he has commanded us," compared with" works which he doeth." The former makes the transition to the thought of disobedience easier. It is possible this change may have been due to the translator misreading the Hebrew before him. The expansions are more obviously additions to the text - they have the invariable character of such things, additions to the words of a passage without being any real addition to the sense. Thus the last clause of <a href="/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14</a>, "For we obeyed not his voice," is expanded into "Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice to walk in the commandments of the Lord, which he hath set before us." After the first eight words, which may be regarded as exactly equivalent to the six in Daniel, the rest is mere expansion. Again, the last obtuse of <a href="/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a>, "we have sinned, we have done wickedly," is expanded into "O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances." Any one can see that here the differences are mere expansion, without any addition to the thought. We might carry our investigation further, and would only make our point clearer; but this would be mere loss of time. This expansion and paraphrasing prove the dependence of Baruch upon Daniel, and therefore the priority of the latter. More important is the utter failure of the writer of Baruch to comprehend the condition of matters at the time he supposes himself writing. In Bar. 1:2 we are told that the Chaldeans "had taken Jerusalem, and burned it with fire." Jerusalem thereafter ceased to be inhabited, for Gedaliah stayed in Mizpah. Yet (Bar. 1:10) the Babylonian Jews say they have sent money "to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings," which it would be impossible to present before God as the temple was a mass of ruins. <a href="/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a> cannot be quoted against this, because the Shechemites and Samaritians there mentioned are carrying an unbloody sacrifice, which might be offered to the Lord at the ruins; but there is no word of burnt offerings or sin offerings. And in harmony with this there is no stress laid in the prayer in Baruch, as there is in the prayer in Daniel, on the absoluteness of the desolation of Zion. On the supposition in the Book of Baruch, Jerusalem had still inhabitants, and there was still a high priest, a state of matters utterly at variance with that implied in the Book of Ezra. No such anachronism can be detected in Daniel; his whole prayer speaks consistently of the desolation of Jerusalem. We do but mention the fact that the high priest "Joachim, sen of Cheleias, sen of Salem" (Bar. 1:7) has no existence in the list of the priests we find in Chronicles and Nehemiah. In <a href="/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a> we are told that Jehozadak "went into captivity," and we know that Joshua was his son. We shall lay no stress on the otherwise unheard-of return to the land of Judah of the vessels "which Sedecias, the son of Joaias, king of Judah had made" (Bar. 1:8), nor on the date in the first verse, "the fifth year in the seventh day of the mouth;" they are in perfect harmony with the general non-historical tone of the whole book. The Book of Daniel has nothing like them. Another historical blunder must be noted - one that proves the dependence of Baruch on Daniel, and disproves the opposite view. The Babylonian Jews declare their intention (Bar. 1:12) to live "under the shadow of Nebuchodonosor King of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son." This makes Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and his associate on the throne, in contradiction of history as we know it now. We know now that Belshazzar was not the son of Nebuchadnezzar, but of Nabunahid. He may have been the grandson of the great conqueror, but not his actual son. The statements in Daniel, while liable to be interpreted in the sense in which the author of Baruch has taken them, do not necessitate this sense, as we have shown above. In Daniel Belshazzar is never described as the son of Nebuchadnezzar in the same way as Darius is called the son of Ahasuerus. It is true Nebuchadnezzar is called his father, and he himself, according to the Massoretic text, speaks of him as his father; but this means no more, in the court language of Assyria, than that he was his predecessor and was famous. As there is no note of chronological succession in Daniel, Belshazzar's occupation of the throne as representative of his father Nabunahid might be any number of years after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, without contradicting anything in it. A writer acquainted with Daniel, and living long after the events, would naturally drop into the blunder of the writer of Baruch, and make Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the writer of Daniel - if he were a novelist - having Baruch in his hand, and not introducing Belshazzar alongside of Nebuchadnezzar. The artistic possibilities of the situation would have been too great to be resisted. We then feel ourselves necessitated to place Baruch long posterior to Daniel. It is difficult to settle the date of Baruch. The latter two chapters, which are certainly by a hand other than the first three, and probably later, have signs in them that make them late. Bar. 5. is an imitation of the Psalter of Solomon 11. The utter inability to comprehend the cessation of burnt offering and sin offering, implied in Bar. 1:10, shows that it was written before the destruction of the temple under Vespasian. It is scarcely possible that it could have been written after the desolation of the temple by Epiphanes. This definitely overthrows the theory of Kneueker, that Baruch was written in Rome after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus. One who had seen the desolation of Jerusalem under the Romans would not have been under the hallucination of the writer of Baruch, or imagined that burnt sacrifices could have been offered by a high priest in Jerusalem after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. Not unlikely the first three chapters were composed in the reign of the Lagid princes, and had for their object to reconcile the Jews to subjection to the foreign yoke. Israel certainly was still scattered among the countries. The huge Jewish communities in Egypt and Babylon, not to speak of the smaller communities scattered over every city round the basin of the Mediterranean, amply proved that. They were no longer an independent nation, they were always subject to some power, and that was a cause of humiliation. If we are right in our idea of the date of the Book of Baruch, and of the relation between it and the Book of Daniel, we have proved that Daniel must have existed long prior to the Maccabean struggle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/9-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Incline</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5186.htm">Strong's 5186: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stretch out, spread out, extend, incline, bend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Your ear,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
