Belshazzar was the co-regent of Babylon, ruling alongside his father Nabonidus. The first year of Belshazzar's reign is generally considered to be around 553 BC. This period was marked by political instability and the decline of the Babylonian Empire. The mention of Belshazzar connects this vision to the historical events leading up to the fall of Babylon, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The historical context is significant because it underscores the theme of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms, a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel.<p><b>Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he lay on his bed</b><br>Dreams and visions are common means of divine revelation in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. Daniel, known for his ability to interpret dreams, receives this vision directly from God. This method of communication emphasizes the supernatural origin of the message. The phrase "as he lay on his bed" suggests a state of rest or contemplation, a time when God often revealed His plans to His prophets (see <a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-17</a> for Jacob's dream). The use of dreams and visions in Daniel also parallels the experiences of other prophets, such as Ezekiel and Zechariah, who received apocalyptic visions.<p><b>He wrote down the dream</b><br>The act of writing down the dream indicates the importance and permanence of the revelation. It suggests that the vision was intended not only for Daniel's understanding but also for future generations. This written account serves as a testimony to God's unfolding plan and provides a record for the Jewish people during their exile. The preservation of the vision in written form aligns with the biblical practice of documenting divine revelations, as seen in other prophetic books.<p><b>and this is the summary of his account</b><br>The phrase indicates that what follows is a condensed version of the vision. This summary serves to highlight the key elements and themes of the revelation. The use of summaries is common in biblical literature, providing clarity and focus on the essential message. In the context of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, the summary introduces a series of symbolic images and prophecies concerning future kingdoms and the ultimate establishment of God's eternal kingdom. This vision is pivotal in the book, as it transitions from historical narratives to apocalyptic prophecy, foreshadowing the coming of the Messiah and the final victory of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Book of Daniel, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during whose reign Daniel received this vision.

Babylon&#8217;s crown prince Belshazzar (see <a href="/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a>) ruled as co-regent with his father Nabonidus beginning about 553 BC. By naming the &#8220;first year,&#8221; Daniel signals that the events recorded in chapter 7 occurred before those of chapters 5 and 6, even though they appear later in the book. God often timestamps prophetic revelation (cf. <a href="/daniel/8-1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>) to prove His sovereignty over time and kingdoms (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). The setting reminds readers that, although earthly powers rise and fall, &#8220;the Most High is ruler over the realm of mankind&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Daniel had a dream</b><p>God chose a dream to convey truth, just as He had with Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-9</a>), Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>), and even Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>). <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a> affirms that dreams are one of the legitimate channels through which the Lord speaks to His prophets. The statement is plain: Daniel literally experienced a nighttime dream initiated by God, not the product of an overactive imagination. That certainty anchors our confidence that what follows is divine revelation, not personal speculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Visions passed through his mind as he lay on his bed</b><p>The Hebrew wording distinguishes between the broader &#8220;dream&#8221; and specific &#8220;visions&#8221; (snapshots or scenes) within it. While lying still, Daniel&#8217;s inner eye was opened to see what ordinary sight cannot perceive&#8212;future history unfolding. <a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-16</a> notes that God seals instruction in such moments of rest; <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-17</a> shows a similar blend of physical stillness and spiritual sight in Peter&#8217;s rooftop vision. The phrase underscores God&#8217;s ability to penetrate the quiet corners of a believer&#8217;s life, turning an ordinary bed into a place of revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He wrote down the dream</b><p>Unlike Nebuchadnezzar, who forgot his dream (<a href="/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>), Daniel immediately recorded what he saw. Scripture repeatedly commands prophets to write: &#8220;Write it on a scroll&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>), &#8220;Write the vision&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>), &#8220;Write, therefore, what you have seen&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-19.htm">Revelation 1:19</a>). By writing, Daniel preserved the message for God&#8217;s people across generations, fulfilling the pattern of inscripturated revelation (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). His obedience also assures us that the details have been transmitted accurately, not filtered through later memory.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the summary of his account</b><p>The phrase signals that what follows condenses a much fuller experience. John makes a similar editorial choice when he writes, &#8220;Jesus performed many other signs... but these are written&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30-31</a>). Luke likewise compiled an &#8220;orderly account&#8221; for Theophilus (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>). Daniel&#8217;s summary is still fully inspired; God guided not only what was seen but what was selected for inclusion. The Spirit safeguarded every essential detail so the prophetic message would remain clear, authoritative, and sufficient.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> sets the stage: at a definite historical moment, God interrupted an exiled prophet&#8217;s night with a Heaven-sent dream composed of vivid visions. Daniel&#8217;s immediate decision to write assures us that the record is exact and reliable. The verse teaches that God governs history, reveals His plans on His timetable, and preserves His word for every generation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>VII.</span><p>(1) The date of this and of the following chapter comes in chronological order after the fourth chapter. As St. Jerome has observed, "<span class= "ital">In superioribus ordo sequitur histori? quid sub Nebuchadonosor et Balthasar, et Dario sive Cyro mirabilium signorum acciderit. In kis vero narrantur somnia qu? singulis sint visa ternporibus: quorum solus propheta conscius est, et nullam habent apud barbaras nationes signi vel revelationis magnitudinem, sed tantum scribuntur, ut apud posteros eorum qu? visa sunt memoria perseveret."</span><p><span class= "bld">Visions.--</span>From this, and from the phrase "sum of the matters," it appears that Daniel had other visions at this time. By "sum" is meant the principal parts of the vision.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-28.</span> - THE VISION OF THE FOUR BEASTS. This chapter begins the second section of the book. All before this has been narrative; visions are introduced into the narrative, but they were not given to Daniel himself, but to others; his <span class="accented">role</span> was the secondary one of interpreter. These visions and the events connected with them are related more as incidents in the biography of Daniel, than as revelations of the future. With this chapter begins a series of revelations to Daniel personally. This chapter is the last chapter of the Aramaic portion of Daniel. Though thus linguistically joined to what has preceded, logically it is related to what follows. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters</span>. The language of the Septuagint is suggestive of the actual state of matters, "While Baltasar was reigning - acting as king - for the first year, Daniel saw a vision beside (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) his head upon his bed. Then Daniel wrote the vision which he had seen in heads (chapters, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of narration (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." While these words do not necessarily imply that Belshazzar was not king, but only acting as king, they yet may mean this. We know now that for five years during the nominal reign of his father Nabunahid, Belshazzar really reigned. Theodotion does not absolutely agree with the Massoretic reading here, "In the first year of Belshazzar King of the Chaldeans, Daniel saw a dream (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) and the visions of his head upon his bed, and he wrote the dream." The omission of the final clause will be observed. The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic; it differs, in fact, only by the insertion of <span class="accented">malcootha</span>, "the reign of," before "Belshazzar." This is, in all probability, the original heading of the tract in which Daniel first published his prophecy. What were the circumstances, so far as we can attain a knowledge of them, when thus the future was revealed to Daniel? The Scythian forces under Astyages had conquered all the countries intermediate between the steppes whence they had come and Babylonia. Above all, they had overthrown the Median Empire, that was closely associated with that of Babylon. They had pressed in upon Babylonia, and were besieging its cities when Cyrus, the King of Ansan, rebelled against Astyages. We may imagine that, from the extent of their empire, the Manda would have to be somewhat scattered. Cyrus then might easily gain advantage over the small division of Manda that held the canton of Ansan. As usually, the attacks of Elam and Media on Babylonia and Assyria had been made across the canton of Ansan; the rebellion of Ansan would thus separate the Manda in Elam and Media from those in Babylonia - the latter being the main portion. Cyrus succeeded in rousing the Medes, Elamites, and Persians against this invading horde, and wrested the power from them. Nabunahid, in a pious inscription, regards Cyrus as the instrument in the hand of Marduk to overthrow these oppressive Manda. Shortly after this uprising of Cyrus, Nabunahid is to appearance stricken with illness, and for several years takes no part in the business of the empire. In the seventh year of Nabunahid, we learn from the annals that the king was in Tema, and did not come to Babylon, but that the king's son conducted the affairs of the monarchy. It was probably, then, in this year, when Cyrus had defeated the Scythians, and had driven them out of Elam, Media, and Babylonia, that Daniel had the vision recounted in this chapter. Keen political insight might easily foresee the events in the comparatively immediate future. The rise of a vigorous new power like that of Persia meant menace to the neighbeuring powers. Babylonia, filled with treachery and discontent, was in no condition to resist. The fall of Babylon seemed imminent - its place was to be taken by Persia. But Babylon had succeeded Assyria, and before Assyria had been the empires of Egypt and the Hittites. He remembered the dream of his old master Nebuchadnezzar.
