Dreams and visions often occur during sleep, as seen with Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5</a>) and Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>). The bed symbolizes a place of vulnerability and openness to spiritual insights.<p><b>I also saw in the visions of my mind</b><br>Visions are a significant means of divine communication in Scripture, often providing insight or prophecy. The mind is the seat of understanding and perception, suggesting that this vision was vivid and impactful.

"Holy one" emphasizes their divine nature and purity. Angels are often messengers or agents of God's judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> with Sodom and Gomorrah. This aligns with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty and the role of angels in His divine plan.<p><b>coming down from heaven</b><br>This indicates the origin and authority of the watcher, emphasizing a divine mission. Heaven is the realm of God, and descent implies intervention in earthly affairs. This mirrors other biblical accounts where angels descend to deliver messages or enact God's will, such as in Jacob's ladder (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>) and the announcement to the shepherds (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who is recounting his dream.

The details show that God speaks deliberately, using His holy messengers to deliver judgments that no earthly ruler can escape.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">A watcher and a holy one--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a holy one who is watchful; translated "angel" by the LXX., but simply transliterated into "Eir" by Theodotion. The word is used twice by the king, and once by Daniel (<a href="/daniel/4-23.htm" title="And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;">Daniel 4:23</a>), but it is to be noticed that the prophet substitutes "the Most High" for the words of the king in <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm" title="This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.">Daniel 4:17</a>). We must suppose that Nebuchadnezzar dreamed in a language familiar to himself, and that the objects of his dream were things with which his Babylonian education had made him acquainted. According to his mythology, the god of Nergal was regarded as "manifesting himself in watching," so that he may have dreamed that he witnessed a descent of one of his deities. In this he is corrected by Daniel, being assured that the whole is sent from heaven, that the decree is ordered by the one true God, and that the holy watcher is an angel of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher</span> <span class="cmt_word">and an holy one came down from heaven.</span> The Septuagint Version is shorter here, and therefore, other things being equal, is to be preferred, "And I saw in my dream, and an angel was sent in power from heaven." Theodotion is as usual in closer accord with the text of the Massoretic than is the Septuagint; yet he omits "of my head." The Peshitta, yet closer to the Massoretic text, only omits "behold." There is now a change in the vision. The monarch sees "a watcher and a holy one descend." This is rendered rightly by the Septuagint, "an angel." Jephet-ibn-Ali maintains that there are two, and that the watcher is the higher. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">eer</span>), "watcher," occurs only in this chapter in the Bible. In the Book of Enoch the name occurs almost a score of times, and is used to designate the archangels. In the present case the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, (<span class="accented">qaddeesh</span>), "a holy one," is in all likelihood an explanatory addition, the word being unknown before - probably an adaptation of some Assyrian name. On the other hand, in the Book of Enoch every one is supposed to be as well acquainted with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of Daniel as with the cherubim and ophanim of Ezekiel and the seraphim of Isaiah. Does not this imply that, at the time the Book of Enoch was written, the Book of Daniel was equally well known with those of the two other prophets? The latest conceivable date for Enoch is <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>, and so late a date never would have been thought of had there not been a necessity to place its date after that at which critics in their wisdom had placed Daniel. The date above mentioned implies that Judas Maccabaeus is unmentioned in a struggle of which he was the crowning hero. Even grant that later date, it is inconceivable that a single generation could have given Daniel such a place of honour as to be regarded as the equal with Isaiah and Ezekiel. In this connection it is to be noticed that, though the <span class="accented">ophunim</span>, "wheels," of Ezekiel are made use of, the <span class="accented">soosim</span>, "horses," of Zechariah do not appear in the later books. Yet they are declared to be spirits. If Daniel were a contemporary of Ezekiel, and his writings had thus had time to sink into the mind of the Jewish people, this phenomenon can be understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As I lay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5922.htm">Strong's 5922: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on my bed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;k&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
