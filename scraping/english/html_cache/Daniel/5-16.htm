Despite being in exile, Daniel's wisdom and ability to interpret dreams and visions were well-known. This reflects the biblical principle that a person's gifts can make room for them and bring them before great men (<a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>).<p><b>that you are able to give interpretations</b><br>Daniel's ability to interpret dreams and visions is a recurring theme in the Book of Daniel. This gift is attributed to divine wisdom rather than human skill, emphasizing the sovereignty of God in revealing mysteries (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>). Daniel's role as an interpreter parallels Joseph's in Genesis, where God also provided interpretations through His servant.<p><b>and solve difficult problems</b><br>The phrase highlights Daniel's exceptional wisdom and understanding, which were recognized even by pagan rulers. This ability to solve enigmas and riddles is reminiscent of Solomon's wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). It underscores the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>Therefore, if you can read this inscription</b><br>The inscription refers to the mysterious writing on the wall, which none of the king's wise men could interpret. This sets the stage for Daniel's divine insight, contrasting human inability with God's omniscience. The event foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's will through Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>and give me its interpretation</b><br>The king's request for interpretation signifies the desperation and urgency of the situation. It also reflects the biblical motif of seeking divine guidance in times of crisis. This mirrors the New Testament call to seek wisdom from God in faith (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5-6</a>).<p><b>you will be clothed in purple</b><br>Purple clothing was a symbol of royalty and high status in ancient cultures, including Babylon. This reward signifies honor and recognition, similar to how believers are promised robes of righteousness through Christ (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>and have a gold chain placed around your neck</b><br>The gold chain represents wealth and authority. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such adornments were given to those who held significant positions of power. This reward parallels the honor given to Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>).<p><b>and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom</b><br>This offer reflects the political structure of Babylon at the time, where Belshazzar was co-regent with his father, Nabonidus. Daniel's potential promotion to third in command highlights God's ability to elevate His servants to positions of influence, as seen throughout Scripture (e.g., Joseph, Esther). It also foreshadows the ultimate reign of Christ, who will rule over all nations (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the time of this event.
