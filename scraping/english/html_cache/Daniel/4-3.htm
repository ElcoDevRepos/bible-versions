In the context of Daniel, these signs include the interpretation of dreams and the miraculous deliverance of Daniel and his friends. Biblically, signs often serve as divine confirmations of God's power and presence, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12) and the miracles of Jesus (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>). These signs are not just for amazement but to lead people to faith and repentance.<p><b>how mighty His wonders!</b><br>Wonders refer to acts that inspire awe and reveal God's sovereignty. In Daniel, the fiery furnace and the lion's den are examples of God's mighty wonders. Historically, these events demonstrate God's ability to protect and deliver His people against overwhelming odds. Theologically, they prefigure the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who performed wonders to authenticate His divine mission (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>).<p><b>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the everlasting nature of God's reign, contrasting with the temporary and often oppressive kingdoms of the world, such as Babylon. Theologically, it points to the Messianic kingdom prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and fulfilled in Christ's eternal reign (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>). This eternal kingdom is a central theme in Daniel, highlighting God's ultimate authority over human history.<p><b>His dominion endures from generation to generation.</b><br>This statement underscores the perpetual and unchanging rule of God throughout all ages. It reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness and sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a>. Historically, it reassures believers of God's control over the rise and fall of empires, providing hope and stability. Culturally, it challenges the temporal power of earthly rulers, affirming that God's dominion transcends all human authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who is the speaker in this verse.

In Daniel, the fiery-furnace deliverance (<a href="/daniel/3-24.htm">Daniel 3:24-28</a>) or the king&#8217;s own dream and its fulfillment (<a href="/daniel/4-28.htm">Daniel 4:28-37</a>) serve as billboard-sized testimonies that the Most High rules.<p>&#8226; The greatness of these signs is not measured by spectacle alone but by the clarity with which they reveal God. Like the plagues of Egypt intended &#8220;that you may know that I am the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/10-2.htm">Exodus 10:2</a>), or the feeding of the five thousand that led crowds to confess Jesus as &#8220;the Prophet&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>), every divine sign shouts, &#8220;Look to Him!&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/145-12.htm">Psalm 145:12</a> celebrates telling the next generation &#8220;the glorious splendor of Your kingdom,&#8221; echoing the same conviction: when God acts, His people must declare it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how mighty His wonders!</b><p>If &#8220;signs&#8221; grab our attention, &#8220;wonders&#8221; leave us speechless.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wonders&#8221; highlight the power behind the sign. <a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a> marvels, &#8220;You are the God who works wonders,&#8221; and Daniel later records Darius confessing that God &#8220;performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/6-27.htm">Daniel 6:27</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a> Jesus is attested &#8220;by miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; &#8212; the New Testament&#8217;s affirmation that the same wonder-working God is now revealing Himself in the Son.<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s choice of words lays stress on might: the God who flung him from palace to pasture and back again wields irresistible power. That power is not random; it is redemptive, drawing hearts to repentance and faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His kingdom is an eternal kingdom;</b><p>With earthly thrones looking impressive yet fragile, the Babylonian emperor confesses a kingdom that outlasts every empire, including his own.<p>&#8226; Daniel had already interpreted the statue dream: &#8220;the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). What was once mere information has now become personal conviction for the king.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/145-13.htm">Psalm 145:13</a> plainly declares, &#8220;Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> speaks of the Messiah&#8217;s reign that will have &#8220;no end.&#8221; Scripture consistently portrays God&#8217;s rule as timeless, unaffected by coups, elections, or dynasties.<p>&#8226; This eternal quality reassures believers that the moral order of the universe is not left to chance; it is anchored in the unchanging reign of the Most High.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His dominion endures from generation to generation.</b><p>The verse closes by emphasizing continuity.<p>&#8226; Every generation meets new challenges, but the same sovereign Lord presides. <a href="/lamentations/5-19.htm">Lamentations 5:19</a> confesses, &#8220;You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a> promises that Christ &#8220;will reign over the house of Jacob forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; History&#8217;s pages turn, yet God writes the whole story. From Adam to the present, His dominion does not wane with time or depend on human approval.<p>&#8226; This truth fuels faithfulness: grandparents and grandchildren alike can trust the same King, confident that His authority will not expire before the next headline appears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a> unfolds like a rising crescendo: it begins with the awe of seeing God&#8217;s signs, intensifies with the power of His wonders, anchors in the permanence of His kingdom, and settles into the enduring comfort of His dominion across all generations. The verse invites us to celebrate what God does, marvel at who He is, and rest in the certainty that His reign will never fail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4101.htm">Strong's 4101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Interrogative what?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7687;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7260.htm">Strong's 7260: </a> </span><span class="str2">Very great things </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[are] His signs,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1514;&#1433;&#1493;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
