This act parallels the sealing of Jesus' tomb with a stone (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>), suggesting a type of Christ in Daniel's experience. The den, likely a pit or cave, was a common method for containing lions, reflecting the harshness of ancient justice systems.<p><b>and the king sealed it with his own signet ring</b><br>The use of a signet ring was a common practice for authenticating documents and decrees, signifying authority and ownership. The king's involvement indicates the seriousness of the decree and his personal investment in the situation. This act of sealing is reminiscent of the sealing of Jesus' tomb by Roman authority (<a href="/matthew/27-66.htm">Matthew 27:66</a>), emphasizing the perceived permanence of the situation.<p><b>and with the rings of his nobles</b><br>Involving the nobles' rings suggests a collective agreement and shared responsibility among the ruling class. This reflects the political structure of the Medo-Persian Empire, where decisions were often made with the counsel of advisors. It underscores the irrevocability of the decree, as seen in the laws of the Medes and Persians (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>).<p><b>so that nothing concerning Daniel could be changed</b><br>This phrase highlights the unchangeable nature of the law once enacted, a theme consistent with the Medo-Persian legal system.

The nobles also would be unable to put Daniel to death in the event of his escaping the fury of the lions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel</span>. The Septuagint text begins, according to Tischendorf, with a passage elsewhere considered, "And the king was grieved, and commanded to cast Daniel into the den of lions, according to the decree which he had made concerning him." This is repeated from the fourteenth verse, where it appears alike in the Chisian Manuscript and in the version of Paul of Tella, "Then Daniel was cast into the den of lions, and a stone was brought and placed at the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signets of his lords, in order that Daniel might not be raised by them or delivered by the king out of the den." The reason assigned for the double sealing of the stone, while a very probable one, is from its very probability to be suspected; it is most likely an explanatory marginal remark, that has slipped into the text. It will be observed that the clause with which the Septuagint Version of this verse begins is the equivalent of the opening clause of the preceding verse. Theodotion's rendering does not differ from the Massoretic reading. From the similarity of the dialects, the resemblance of the Peshitta to the Massoretic is even closer. There are few criticisms of Daniel more unfair than that founded on the assumption that the writer had a bottle-shaped dungeon in his mind, that might be covered over as a well by one large stone. Nothing in the words used implies this. While gob certainly means a "pit" or a "cistern," it was by no means necessarily of small size or covered over with one stone, so that within it would be darkness. There were probably walls rising from the sides of the pit which formed the den; in that wall there would be naturally an aperture through which food could be passed to the lions. Through this door was Daniel cast, and when he had been so cast in, a stone was rolled up to the aperture and sealed. There is no necessity for arguing, as Hitzig and von Lengerke do, against this incident. The passage the former refers to in Xenophon's 'Anabasis' (v. 5.25) applies to dwellings of human beings, and even if we could transfer its description to the present case, it would not damage our argument. In these dwellings Xenophon tells us "were goats, sheep, oxen, birds, and their young; all the cattle are fed within with green fodder." These critics forget that lions' dens were in use not only among the Assyrians and Babylonians, but also among the Greek monarchs, and so, even if the writer was of the late date attributed to him by critics, still he would not speak nonsense about what he could not fail to know something. Hitzig sees in Daniel being let down into the den of lions an imitation of what befell Joseph at the hands of his brethren. Certainly the same word is used in the Targum of Onkelos, <a href="/genesis/37-22.htm">Genesis 37:22</a>, but identity of name does not prove identity of thing. No one could argue that the pit of a theatre was necessarily dark, dirty, and damp, because a coal-pit is. That Reuben persuaded his brethren to put Joseph in the pit in order to save him alive, and the rulers had Daniel put in the lions' den in order to destroy him, is nothing to the purpose, it would seem; that there were lions in the pit or den in which Daniel was placed, and no venomous beast in that into which Joseph was let down, is also of no moment. The further fact that this letting down into the pit occurs in the beginning of Joseph's career, and in Daniel's case it is near the end of a long and prosperous life, is not noticed. The life of Daniel must be proved to be written in imitation of the life of Joseph, so any means are good enough to secure this predetermined conclusion. While this resemblance is only superficial, there is another resemblance that is, at all events, full of interest. In later history there was another sealing of the stone that was rolled to the mouth of a grave - it may be noted that <span class="accented">gob</span> is used for a "grave" also - and fear here also was lest the innocently condemned might be taken away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2298.htm">Strong's 2298: </a> </span><span class="str2">As card, one, single, first, at once</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_69.htm">Strong's 69: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stone</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
