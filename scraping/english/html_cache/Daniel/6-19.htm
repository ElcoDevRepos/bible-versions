In ancient Near Eastern cultures, dawn was often associated with new beginnings and hope. The king's actions at dawn suggest his eagerness to resolve the situation with Daniel, reflecting his troubled conscience and hope for Daniel's survival. Biblically, dawn is a time of divine intervention and new mercies, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>.<p><b>the king got up</b><br>The king's rising early demonstrates his personal investment in Daniel's fate. Despite being a ruler, Darius shows humility and concern for Daniel, a captive and servant. This action highlights the king's respect and affection for Daniel, who had proven himself trustworthy and faithful. It also underscores the king's internal conflict, as he had been manipulated into signing the decree that endangered Daniel.<p><b>and hurried</b><br>The urgency in the king's actions is significant. It reflects his anxiety and the hope that Daniel's God might have delivered him. This haste contrasts with the usual dignity and deliberation expected of a king, showing the depth of his concern. The king's haste can be seen as a parallel to the urgency of seeking God in times of distress, as encouraged in <a href="/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>.<p><b>to the den of lions</b><br>The lion's den was a form of execution in ancient Persia, designed to be both terrifying and final. Archaeological evidence suggests that such dens were constructed to ensure no escape. The den symbolizes a place of trial and divine deliverance, reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God's people face seemingly insurmountable challenges, such as the fiery furnace in <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a>. The lions' den also serves as a type of Christ's burial and resurrection, where Jesus faced death and emerged victorious.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_darius.htm">King Darius</a></b><br>The ruler of the Medo-Persian Empire who reluctantly cast Daniel into the lions' den due to a decree he was tricked into signing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A faithful servant of God and a high-ranking official in the kingdom, known for his unwavering devotion and prayer life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lions'_den.htm">The Lions' Den</a></b><br>A pit or enclosure where lions were kept, used as a means of execution for those who violated the king's decree.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_decree.htm">The Decree</a></b><br>An edict that prohibited prayer to anyone except King Darius for thirty days, which Daniel defied by continuing to pray to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_light_of_dawn.htm">The First Light of Dawn</a></b><br>The time when King Darius, anxious and hopeful, rushed to see if Daniel had survived the night with the lions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_consistent_faithfulness.htm">The Power of Consistent Faithfulness</a></b><br>Daniel's unwavering commitment to God, even in the face of death, challenges us to remain faithful in our daily walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_prayer.htm">The Importance of Prayer</a></b><br>Daniel's habit of prayer was central to his life.

And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Darnel O Daniel servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?</span> "Very early" is really "the glimmer of day;" (<span class="accented">shapharpara</span>). The word used occurs in the Targums. It may, however, be doubted whether the word here is not the Syriac <span class="accented">shapbra.</span> The writing here presents so many peculiarities that suspicion is forced upon the reader. The first <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;</span> is small, and the second is large. There is the further difficulty that <span class="accented">nogah is</span> nearly equivalent to <span class="accented">shaphra.</span> One might suspect a doublet, as Behrmann maintains, here, did not the versions indicate something like this as the meaning of this clause. <span class="accented">A lamentable voice</span> (<span class="accented">atzeeb</span>) seems to mean "sad" or "grieved." The version of the Septuagint shows traces of addition, "And King Darius rose early in the morning, and took with him the satraps, and went and stood at the mouth of the den of lions. Then the king called to Daniel with a loud voice, with weeping, saying, O Daniel, if thou art alive, and thy God whom thou servest continually, hath he saved thee from the lions? and have they not harmed thee?" It is possible the addition of "the satraps" may have been due to <span class="accented">shapharpara</span> being read <span class="accented">ahashdarpnayya.</span> Certainly if the purpose of the double scaling was what it is assigned to be in the first verse, then the satraps would accompany him; only the suggestion is such a natural one that it might readily slip into the text. Ver. 20 (21) in the LXX. has traces of expansion. The omission of <span class="accented">yekeel</span> and the change of <span class="accented">sheezab</span> to the finite preterite is possible enough, and may indicate that in the original text the word rendered "able" was not found. Theodotion renders ver. 19 (20) in accordance with the Massoretic reading, but, in ver. 20 (21) instead of "lamentable voice," has "strong voice," a reading that seems somewhat confirmed by the LXX. Further, he translates the interrogative <span class="accented">ha</span> as if it were the Hebrew <span class="accented">kee</span>, "if." The Peshitta, though agreeing in the nineteenth verse with the Massoretic, has some minor differences in the following verse - "high voice" instead of "lamentable voice," and "faithfully" instead of "continually." The Vulgate singularly inserts in ver. 20 <span class="accented">putasne</span>? "dost thou think?" That Darius should thus hasten in the semi-darkness of the first glimmer of dawn to the lions' den to see whether Daniel were yet alive, was but natural. As the sealing of the lions' den suggested the sealing of the holy sepulchre, so the hastening of Darius to the den in the earliest dawn suggests the action of the women who got up "a great while before day." When Darius calls Daniel the "servant of the living God," there is no necessary confession of faith in him on the part of the king. It is for him simply an act of politeness to a Deity who, if this were neglected, might resent. It is to be noted that this attribute "living" is omitted in the Septuagint. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the first light</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1490;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#601;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5053.htm">Strong's 5053: </a> </span><span class="str2">Brightness, daylight</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of dawn,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;par&#183;p&#257;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8238.htm">Strong's 8238: </a> </span><span class="str2">The dawn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;k&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4430.htm">Strong's 4430: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;q&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6966.htm">Strong's 6966: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and hurried</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1448;&#1514;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;hi&#7791;&#183;b&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_927.htm">Strong's 927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To terrify, hasten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the den</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1490;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7713;ub&#183;b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1358.htm">Strong's 1358: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pit, den</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lions.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1493;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;y&#257;&#183;w&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_744.htm">Strong's 744: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lion</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/6-19.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 6:19 Then the king arose very early (Dan.
