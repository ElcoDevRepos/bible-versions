It is a time marked by significant upheaval and the final establishment of God's kingdom. The "time of the end" is a recurring theme in apocalyptic literature, including the Book of Daniel and Revelation, indicating a period of intense conflict and divine intervention.<p><b>the king of the South will engage him in battle</b><br>The "king of the South" is traditionally understood to represent a power or coalition located to the south of Israel, historically associated with Egypt. In the context of Daniel, this could refer to a future geopolitical entity or alliance that opposes the forces of the "king of the North." The engagement in battle suggests a significant military conflict, reflecting the ongoing struggle between opposing forces throughout history.<p><b>but the king of the North will storm out against him</b><br>The "king of the North" is often identified with powers to the north of Israel, historically linked to the Seleucid Empire. In a prophetic context, this could symbolize a future northern power or coalition. The imagery of "storming out" conveys a sudden and aggressive military campaign, indicating a decisive and forceful response to the southern threat.<p><b>with chariots, horsemen, and many ships</b><br>This phrase describes the military might and resources of the "king of the North." Chariots and horsemen were key components of ancient warfare, symbolizing speed and strength. The inclusion of "many ships" suggests a formidable naval presence, indicating a comprehensive and multi-faceted military strategy. This reflects the historical context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where such elements were crucial for dominance.<p><b>invading many countries and sweeping through them like a flood</b><br>The imagery of a flood conveys overwhelming force and unstoppable advance, suggesting that the "king of the North" will achieve significant territorial expansion and conquest. This phrase highlights the extensive impact of the conflict, affecting multiple nations and regions. The metaphor of a flood is used elsewhere in scripture to describe God's judgment and the destructive power of invading armies, emphasizing the severity and scope of the events described.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_south.htm">King of the South</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as a ruler or power from the southern regions relative to Israel, often associated with Egypt in historical contexts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_the_north.htm">King of the North</a></b><br>A ruler or power from the northern regions relative to Israel, historically linked to the Seleucid Empire, but in eschatological interpretations, it may represent a future northern power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/time_of_the_end.htm">Time of the End</a></b><br>A prophetic period often associated with the culmination of human history and the fulfillment of God's ultimate plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariots,_horsemen,_and_many_ships.htm">Chariots, Horsemen, and Many Ships</a></b><br>Symbolic of military might and the extensive resources used in warfare.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/invasion_and_flood.htm">Invasion and Flood</a></b><br>Metaphors for overwhelming military conquest and the rapid spread of influence or control.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_imagery.htm">Understanding Prophetic Imagery</a></b><br>Recognize the symbolic language used in prophecy to convey spiritual truths and future events.

Lysias was defeated at Bethsur, and the news of the overthrow of his army was brought to Antiochus while he was in Persia. So appalling was the effect upon him of these tidings, that "he fell sick for grief" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/6-8.htm" title="Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished and sore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fell sick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he looked for.">1 Maccabees 6:8</a>), and died. It is unnecessary <span class= "ital">to</span> suppose that the revelation resumes the narrative from <a href="/daniel/11-29.htm" title="At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.">Daniel 11:29</a> after a parenthetic passage (<a href="/context/daniel/11-30.htm" title="For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.">Daniel 11:30-39</a>), or to assume that we have a general recapitulation of the wars of Antiochus, described in <a href="/context/daniel/11-22.htm" title="And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflowed from before him, and shall be broken; yes, also the prince of the covenant.">Daniel 11:22-39</a>, without distinguishing the different campaigns. (For a good account of Antiochus, see <span class= "ital">Judas Maccab?us,</span> by C. R. Conder, R. E., Daniel 3.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over</span>. The Septuagint Version is somewhat shorter, "And at the time of the end the King of Egypt shall push at him: and the king of the north shall be enraged at him, with chariots and many horses and many ships, and shall enter into the land of Egypt." Probably the Massoretic has been amplified. Still it is a possible thing that, as Egypt was the natural objective of all the military preparations of Syria, the shorter summary might be inserted instead of the longer paraphrase of the Massoretic. Throughout in the Septuagint Version, as may be noted, "Egypt" stands in place of "the south." Theodotion is much closer to the Massoretic, but omits "the whirlwind," and has. instead of "countries," <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the land." The Peshitta differs in some respects more from the Massoretic than either of the Greek texts, "And at the end of time the king of the south shall strive with him: and the king of the north shall be moved against him, with chariots and horsemen and with many ships; and he shall act impiously in the land." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">At the time of the end.</span> This refers to the same "time of the end" as that in ver. 35; that is to say, not the end of the world, but the end of this distress. It is possible that to the writer the entrance of the new era - the Messianic time - would coincide with the fall of Antiochus, and that this era might be regarded as the end of the world. <span class="accented">The king of the south shall push at him.</span> This suggests war begun by the King of Egypt against Syria. It is difficult to see how this could take place after the fourth expedition of Antiochus into Egypt. The two brothers, Philometor and Euergetes (Physcon), were at war with each other shortly after this, and though Philometor gained the mastery, he was not in a position to threaten Syria. Certainly, had Ptolemy Philometor been in a position to take vengeance on his uncle, the successful rebellion of the Jews afforded an opportunity. We have no record in Polybius, Livy, 1 Maccabees, or Josephus of any expedition of Egypt against Epiphanes, either planned or attempted. Polybius is certainly fragmentary, and so to a greater extent is Livy; yet what has come down bears on events so near chronologically to this alleged expedition planned against Syria that it would scarcely fail to be noticed. <span class="accented">And the king of the north shall dome against him like a whirlwind</span>, <span class="accented">with chariot</span>, <span class="accented">and with horsemen</span>, <span class="accented">and with many ships.</span> This purports to be an account of an expedition undertaken by Epiphanes against Ptolemy, presumably Philometor. Of this there is not a trace; Antiochus is in so great need of money that he must use one half his army to collect money by robbing temples in Elymais, while the other, under Lysias, is occupied in attempting to put down the rebellion of the Jews. Again the historians of the period are silent, and what they tell us is inconsistent with this fifth expedition. Jerome, in his commentary on Daniel, quotes Porphyry, who gives an account of an expedition against Egypt in the eleventh year of his reign. That, however, was the year of his death - the year, therefore, of his expedition against Elymais. It is impossible that in the beginning of that year he should undertake such an expedition into Egypt as that described by Porphyry, and at the end have time to march into Elymais. It cannot be the expedition of Lysias which is referred to, for he is represented (1 Macc. 3:32) as having the oversight of all the territory of the king from the river Euphrates, but there is no notice of ships <span class="accented">And he shall enter into the countries</span>, <span class="accented">and shall overflow and pass over.</span> This might refer to the expedition which Antiochus undertook to Elymais, but in the following verse we learn the direction was toward Egypt. No such expedition occurred after the fourth. What explanation is to be given of this? The explanation favoured by Keil of this whole chapter, that the king of the north is antichrist, is applied here; but so much of the earlier portion of this chapter can be interpreted as history, that we, for our part, are loth to give an eschatological interpretation to this. The view favoured by most is that here the author narrated his expectations, but these expectations were contrary to facts. This is Professor Bevan's view. If this view had been correct, the expectations of the author would be falsified almost as soon as they were recorded; this would certainly seem to render it impossible for the book to get the vogue it did. We, for our part, favour a modification of the view maintained by Hitzig, that this section is a repetition of what has been previously mentioned. Against this is the chronological statement at the beginning. Regarding, as we do, this chapter as an interpolation and the work of a later hand, our idea is that the section before us is one attempt to interpolate, and the preceding section is another, and that both have been incorporated in the narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-40.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
