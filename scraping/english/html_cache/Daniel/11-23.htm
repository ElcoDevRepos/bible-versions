In the context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, this likely involves a pact with a smaller or weaker nation or group. Historically, this could be linked to the alliances made by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, a Seleucid king known for his cunning and deceitful tactics. Alliances in the ancient Near East were often strategic, aimed at consolidating power or countering a common enemy. Biblically, alliances can be seen as both positive and negative, depending on whether they align with God's will (e.g., <a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a>, where the Israelites make a treaty with the Gibeonites).<p><b>he will act deceitfully</b><br>Deceit is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, often associated with the actions of those who oppose God's people. In this context, deceit refers to the cunning and treacherous methods used by the ruler to achieve his goals. This aligns with the character of Antiochus IV, who was known for his manipulative diplomacy. Deceit is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>), and it is often contrasted with the truth and righteousness embodied by Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>for he will rise to power with only a few people</b><br>This phrase highlights the unexpected and unconventional rise to power. Historically, Antiochus IV gained control through a series of strategic moves and alliances, rather than through overwhelming military might. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in Daniel, where power is obtained not by traditional means but through cunning and strategic alliances. Biblically, this contrasts with the way God often uses the weak or few to accomplish His purposes (e.g., Gideon's army in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the ultimate sovereignty of God over human affairs, as seen in the rise and fall of kingdoms throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_the_north.htm">The King of the North</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a ruler from the Seleucid Empire, historically associated with Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who is known for his cunning and deceitful rise to power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_alliance.htm">The Alliance</a></b><br>This refers to a political agreement or treaty made with the king, which he uses to his advantage through deceit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_few_people.htm">The Few People</a></b><br>This phrase indicates that the king will not need a large army or many followers to gain power, highlighting his cunning and strategic manipulation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rise_to_power.htm">Rise to Power</a></b><br>The event of the king's ascent to authority, achieved through deceit and strategic alliances rather than traditional military might.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_deceit.htm">The Danger of Deceit</a></b><br>Deceit can be a powerful tool for gaining power, but it ultimately leads to destruction.

In history this fits Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who secured the throne through a treaty with other contenders; in prophecy it foreshadows the final man of lawlessness who will also broker agreements for his own gain (cf. <a href="/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse stresses timing&#8212;deceit follows covenant. Just as Antiochus used a negotiated peace with Egypt to mask his ambitions, the future antichrist will &#8220;confirm a covenant with many for one week&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>) before revealing his true intentions.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word warns repeatedly that alliances forged apart from His counsel become snares (<a href="/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8&#8211;9</a>). The text reminds believers to measure every agreement by Scripture, not expedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he will act deceitfully</b><p>&#8226; Deceit, not force, is the ruler&#8217;s primary tool. Antiochus employed flattery and intrigue, winning cities &#8220;by intrigue&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>). Likewise, the last-days tyrant comes &#8220;with every wicked deception&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture exposes the pattern:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/daniel/11-27.htm">Daniel 11:27</a>&#8212;two kings &#8220;speak lies at the same table.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>&#8212;the beast &#8220;deceives those who dwell on the earth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Believers are called to sober discernment. <a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a> cautions, &#8220;The simple believe every word, but the prudent consider their steps.&#8221; Taking God&#8217;s warnings literally keeps us from being seduced by polished words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he will rise to power with only a few people</b><p>&#8226; The ascent begins small. Antiochus returned from Rome with limited supporters, yet within a short time controlled a vast empire (<a href="/daniel/11-24.htm">Daniel 11:24</a>). Jesus notes a similar end-time dynamic: &#8220;Many who are first will be last, and the last first&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-31.htm">Mark 10:31</a>); God allows unlikely figures to rise so His foreknowledge is unmistakable.<p>&#8226; Small beginnings magnify deceit&#8217;s role. With no mass movement behind him, the ruler relies on covert alliances and strategic favors&#8212;echoing <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-13</a>, where ten kings &#8220;receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty. <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a> declares, &#8220;Exaltation does not come from east, west, or desert, but God is Judge; He brings one down and lifts another up.&#8221; Even sinister thrones rise only within the limits He permits, serving His larger redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/11-23.htm">Daniel 11:23</a> paints a precise sequence: a crafty leader enters covenant, immediately turns to deceit, and swiftly ascends from a modest base. History validates the prophecy in Antiochus IV; the New Testament projects it onto the future antichrist. Each clause reminds believers that (1) political agreements apart from God invite peril, (2) deception often precedes open aggression, and (3) apparent underdogs can wield vast power when God allows. Taking the verse literally equips us to recognize the same pattern in any age and to cling to the One whose kingdom alone is built on truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">He shall work.</span>--Apparently this verse explains more fully the means by which the king succeeds in maintaining his influence. He has already destroyed those who are at peace with him. From the time that he first becomes their confederate, he works deceitfully, coming up with hostile intent, accompanied only by a few people, and in this way throwing off their guard those whom he would destroy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "And with the covenant and a people set in array he shall fabricate a lie, even against a strong nation with (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) a small people." The rendering of Theodotion is somewhat difficult to comprehend, "By reason of leagues against him, he shall make a device, and shall ascend and master them with few people." The Peshitta is very like Theodotion, only the last clause of this verse is regarded as the first of the next. The Vulgate is closer to the Massoretic than are any of the other ancient versions, "And after friendships with him, he shall work fraud, and shall go up and conquer with a small number." The reference here is to the obscure events which attended the contest - if there was a con-test - that resulted in Epiphanes securing the throne. The alliance may refer to his league with Eumenes. Appian assigns as a reason for the help given to Epiphanes by Eumenes, that it was to gain his friendship. Only Appian mentions "Attains and Eumenes," as if they were separate sovereigns; but Attains was brother of Eumenes, and, at the time of the arrival of Epiphanes, his brother's envoy at Rome. There may be some foundation of fact, and this would explain the statement in the text. The hopes of Eumenes, if he wished to strengthen himself by an alliance with Epiphanes, were probably soon frustrated, as Epiphanes involved himself in conflict with Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
