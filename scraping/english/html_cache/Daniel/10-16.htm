The act of touching the lips is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/6-7.htm">Isaiah 6:7</a>, where a seraphim touches Isaiah's lips with a coal to purify him. This signifies preparation for speaking or receiving a message from God. The "likeness of a man" suggests a theophany or angelophany, where divine beings appear in human form, a common biblical motif.<p><b>and I opened my mouth and said to the one standing before me</b><br>The opening of Daniel's mouth signifies readiness to communicate, often seen in prophetic literature when a prophet is about to deliver a message from God. The "one standing before me" is likely the same angelic figure who has been interacting with Daniel throughout this vision, possibly Gabriel, who is mentioned earlier in the book (<a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>).<p><b>&#8220;My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish</b><br>Daniel addresses the figure as "my lord," a term of respect and acknowledgment of authority. The vision he refers to is the intense and overwhelming revelation of future events, which causes him great distress. This reflects the common prophetic experience of being physically and emotionally affected by divine revelations, as seen in other prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>).<p><b>and I have no strength.</b><br>The lack of strength is a physical manifestation of the spiritual and emotional burden of receiving divine visions. This mirrors other biblical accounts where individuals are left weakened by encounters with the divine, such as John in <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>.

Daniel has been mourning and fasting for three weeks (<a href="/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2&#8211;3</a>). In Scripture, God often steps in &#8220;suddenly,&#8221; underscoring His sovereignty and perfect timing (<a href="/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3</a>; <a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3</a>). Daniel&#8217;s experience mirrors earlier sudden appearances of heavenly beings to prophets and shepherds alike (<a href="/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a>; <a href="/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a>). The Lord&#8217;s interventions come precisely when His servants need strength and revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One with the likeness of a man</b><p>The visitor appears human, yet clearly carries heavenly authority. Daniel had already seen such a figure in 8:15 and 9:21&#8212;commonly understood as the angel Gabriel&#8212;while Ezekiel saw &#8220;one with the appearance of a man&#8221; seated on a sapphire throne (<a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>). <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a> describes the glorified Christ &#8220;like a son of man.&#8221; Whether angelic or a Christophany, the point is that God bridges the gap between heaven and earth in a form Daniel can bear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Touched my lips</b><p>Divine touch prepares a prophet to speak. Isaiah&#8217;s unclean lips were purified with a live coal (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>), Jeremiah&#8217;s mouth was touched so he could declare God&#8217;s word (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). Here, the touch renews Daniel&#8217;s strength and enables his response. God never calls His servants without also equipping them (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I opened my mouth</b><p>Once empowered, Daniel can at last communicate. The sequence&#8212;divine touch, then human speech&#8212;highlights that revelatory truth originates with God, not the prophet (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). Silence gives way to testimony when God enables it (<a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Said to the one standing before me</b><p>Daniel addresses the messenger with reverence (&#8220;my lord&#8221;), recognizing the authority delegated from God (<a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>). Angelic beings stand ready to serve (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>), yet refuse worship; Daniel&#8217;s respectful address shows submission without idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My lord, because of the vision</b><p>The vision&#8217;s magnitude overwhelms Daniel. Previous revelations of empires and spiritual conflict (<a href="/bsb/daniel/8.htm">Daniel 8&#8211;9</a>) had already left him exhausted; this new disclosure of angelic warfare (10:13) is even more daunting. Encounters with heavenly glory consistently humble human observers (<a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am overcome with anguish</b><p>The phrase conveys wrenching pain of spirit. Similar language appears when Joseph&#8217;s brothers faced great distress (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>) and when Hannah poured out her soul in bitterness (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10</a>). Revelation often uncovers both the majesty and the severity of God&#8217;s plans, stirring deep emotional response (<a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have no strength</b><p>Physical weakness accompanies spiritual encounter. Daniel had already collapsed in 10:8-9. John experienced the same in <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, and even strong Elijah crumbled after Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>). God&#8217;s power is perfected in such weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). The messenger&#8217;s subsequent touch (<a href="/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>) will replenish Daniel, proving that dependence on divine strength is essential for understanding and obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/10-16.htm">Daniel 10:16</a> portrays the prophet&#8217;s frailty meeting heaven&#8217;s power. A sudden, human-like messenger touches Daniel&#8217;s lips, enabling him to speak despite crushing anguish and utter weakness brought on by the overwhelming vision. Each detail mirrors earlier prophetic experiences, underscoring that God graciously equips His servants, confronts them with His glory, and sustains them when their own strength fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">One like</span> . . .--Comp. <a href="/daniel/8-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.">Daniel 8:15</a>.

By "sorrows" is meant the pain produced by terror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.</span> The LXX. rendering differs from this, "And behold, as the likeness of the hand of a man" - due, more likely to explanatory paraphrase than to various reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>; still the phrase, "a likeness of sons of man," is somewhat violent, and not to be paralleled by <a href="/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a> - "touched my lips, and I opened my mouth, and spake, and I said to him who stood before me, Lord, even when the vision was turned upon my side to me." Clearly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tzeedee</span>) has been read by mistake for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tzeeree</span>). The sense of the Massoretic is difficult; but this is nonsense. "And there was no strength in me," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span>. Theodotion renders, "And behold, as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth, and spake, and said to him that stood before me, In thy appearance my bowels (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) were turned in me, and I had no strength." Theodotion has evidently had the singular <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, or perhaps regarded it as a survival of the old form of the construct. It is probably not due to a different reading, but to a different meaning given to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, that we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta resembles Theodotion very closely, having, however, <span class="accented">enosh</span>, "man," instead of "son of man." We have also go', "body," or "viscera," as the translation of <span class="accented">tzeereem.</span> The Vulgate renders to the same purport; the last portion of the verse runs thus: <span class="accented">In visions tua dissolutas sunt compages meae et nihil in me remansit virium.</span> It also has, in the first clause, <span class="accented">similitudo filii hominis.</span> It seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that we should read "son of man" instead of "sons of man" Were there any diplomatic or other evidence in favour of the reading of the LXX., it would be much preferable to any other, as we have the description of the visitant whose hand touched Daniel, in vers. 5 and 6. Hence the assertion here, that the likeness of a son of man touched him, does not harmonize with this, as it seems to introduce a new person. There is no reference to hands in the description in vers. 5 and 6, "the hand as of a man" there would not be the introduction of something already mentioned. <span class="accented">Touched my lips.</span> In the previous chapter, ver. 21, the angel Gabriel "touches" Daniel. The emphasis of the act, in the present instance, does not be in the fact of touching, but in this - that it was the lips that were touched. In <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a> and 7 one of the seraphim touches the lips of the prophet with "<span class="accented">a</span> live coal from off the altar." In Isaiah the object is purification; in the case before us it is the restoration of the power of speech. <span class="accented">Then I opened my mouth</span>, <span class="accented">and spake</span>, <span class="accented">and said unto him that stood before</span> me. This is the result of the touch of the angelic hand. <span class="accented">O my lord</span>, <span class="accented">by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me</span>, <span class="accented">and I have retained no strength.</span> "Lord" here is not "Jehovah," but "Adonai" - a title of respect, certainly, but not necessarily of adoration. Theodotion and the Vulgate render "thy vision," understanding by that "thy appearance." The meaning is the same as that of the ordinary reading. Hence it is probably due to a desire to emphasize this rather than to any difference of reading. "My sorrows are turned upon me." This is a term that involves great difficulty. The term is used of the pangs of childbirth (<a href="/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19</a>), and transferred to sorrows (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). And this is the sense in which it has generally been taken here; the more readily that in <a href="/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19</a> the same phrase is used as here But the sense does not seem very good; the appearance of the angel was not an occasion of sorrow, however much of awe there might be in it. The word has a number of meanings, which it is certainly difficult to bring into relationship with each other. Thus in <a href="/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a> it means a "hinge;" in <a href="/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a> it means "messenger," and this is the meaning it most frequently bears (<a href="/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>). Neither of these meanings is at all suitable. In <a href="/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a> we have the word appearing in the K'thib, and translated "beauty;" hence it would be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">hodee</span>) of ver. 8. The LXX. is out of court. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate differ from each other, so that nothing is to be drawn from them. We would, then, take this phrase as equivalent to that in the eighth verse, "I have retained no strength." This fitly follows up what has been already stated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/10-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And suddenly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
