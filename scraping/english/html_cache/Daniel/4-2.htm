In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings often issued decrees to proclaim their achievements or the achievements of their gods. Here, Nebuchadnezzar's declaration is unique as it centers on the God of Israel, rather than the Babylonian deities. This reflects a significant transformation in his understanding and acceptance of the Most High God.<p><b>the signs and wonders</b><br>The terms "signs" and "wonders" are often used in the Bible to describe miraculous events that demonstrate God's power and authority. In the Old Testament, these terms frequently refer to the miracles performed during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>). In Daniel, these signs and wonders include the miraculous events surrounding Daniel and his friends, such as the interpretation of dreams and the deliverance from the fiery furnace. These acts serve as evidence of God's sovereignty over earthly kingdoms and His ability to intervene in human affairs.<p><b>that the Most High God</b><br>The title "Most High God" emphasizes God's supreme authority over all other gods and rulers. This title is used throughout the Old Testament to denote God's ultimate power and sovereignty (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>, <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a>). In the context of Daniel, it highlights the contrast between the God of Israel and the gods of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar's use of this title signifies his recognition of God's unparalleled authority, a significant admission from a king who once saw himself as the supreme ruler.<p><b>has performed for me.</b><br>This personal acknowledgment by Nebuchadnezzar underscores the direct impact of God's actions on his life. The king's experiences, including his humbling period of madness and subsequent restoration, are seen as divine interventions meant to reveal God's power and mercy. This personal testimony aligns with the biblical theme of God using individuals' lives to demonstrate His glory and purpose (<a href="/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>, <a href="/acts/22-15.htm">Acts 22:15</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of personal testimony in witnessing to God's work in one's life (<a href="/john/9-25.htm">John 9:25</a>, <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who experienced a humbling encounter with God, leading to his acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A Jewish exile in Babylon who served in the king's court and interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dreams, demonstrating God's wisdom and power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, known for its grandeur and as a place of exile for the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high_god.htm">The Most High God</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His supreme authority over all earthly rulers and kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous events orchestrated by God to reveal His power and authority, often leading to a deeper understanding or transformation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledging God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, and His power is unmatched.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/testifying_to_god's_works.htm">Testifying to God's Works</a></b><br>Like Nebuchadnezzar, we should be eager to share the ways God has worked in our lives, giving Him glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_before_god.htm">Humility Before God</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's experience teaches us the importance of humility and the dangers of pride.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_miracles.htm">The Purpose of Miracles</a></b><br>Understand that signs and wonders are meant to point us to God and deepen our faith, not just to amaze us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_encounter.htm">Transformation Through Encounter</a></b><br>Personal encounters with God can lead to profound changes in our beliefs and actions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Daniel_4_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Daniel 4:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_share_God_s_works_in_our_lives.htm">How can we "declare the signs and wonders" God has done in our lives?

After years of pride, exile to the fields, and restoration, his heart is now genuinely &#8220;pleased&#8221; to speak well of God (<a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Joy is a natural response to God&#8217;s saving work. &#8220;I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-1.htm">Psalm 34:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Mary&#8217;s song when she was &#8220;greatly rejoicing in God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-47</a>), true testimony springs from delight, not duty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to declare</b><p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s pleasure drives him to verbal proclamation. Saving encounters with God are meant to be told, not tucked away. &#8220;Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus told delivered men to &#8220;proclaim what great things God has done for you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/8-39.htm">Luke 8:39</a>). Such public confession gives God the credit He deserves and encourages others to trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the signs and wonders</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Signs&#8221; point to God&#8217;s character; &#8220;wonders&#8221; leave observers in awe. Together they summarize the miraculous dealings God used to humble and restore Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/4-33.htm">Daniel 4:33-36</a>).<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, signs and wonders authenticate God&#8217;s message and messenger:<p>&#8211; <a href="/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3-5</a>&#8212;plagues confirmed Moses&#8217; call.<p>&#8211; <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>&#8212;Jesus was &#8220;accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>&#8212;God testified to the gospel &#8220;by signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that the Most High God</b><p>&#8226; The title highlights God&#8217;s unrivaled supremacy.

Paul did the same: &#8220;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&#8212;of whom I am the worst&#8230; so that in me, the foremost, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Sharing what God has &#8220;performed for me&#8221; invites hearers to expect His gracious intervention in their own lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a> shows a once-arrogant king transformed into a joyful witness. Each phrase traces the journey: delight in God (&#8220;I am pleased&#8221;), readiness to speak (&#8220;to declare&#8221;), focus on divine activity (&#8220;the signs and wonders&#8221;), exaltation of God&#8217;s supremacy (&#8220;the Most High God&#8221;), and personal appropriation (&#8220;has performed for me&#8221;). The verse models how every redeemed life should overflow&#8212;celebrating, proclaiming, and personalizing God&#8217;s mighty works so others may see His greatness and turn to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Signs and wonders.--</span>Comp. <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm" title="Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwells in mount Zion.">Isaiah 8:18</a>.

How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</span> The Greek versions for these two verses are in absolute agreement, hence one is not surprised to find that in the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis, these verses, with that preceding, are marked with an asterisk, which proclaims them not to have been regarded by their translator as a genuine part of the Septuagint, but to have been added from Theodotion. They are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. In these two verses the Peshitta is also at one with the Massoretic text. It is possible that this may have been the actual beginning of the document; on the other hand, it may have been simply the suggestion of some later scribe of how such a proclamation might have begun. The latter is, perhaps, the more probable. At the same time, it vindicates its position by being a not unnatural expression of feelings such as Nebuchadnezzar might well be supposed to have had after such an experience as he had passed through. It may even be that the signs and wonders to which Nebuchadnezzar refers are not merely those of his dream and its fulfilment, but all the signs that had been manifested in his reign. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I am pleased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;p&#772;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8232.htm">Strong's 8232: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be fair or seemly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to declare</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;w&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2324.htm">Strong's 2324: </a> </span><span class="str2">To show</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the signs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1514;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7791;ay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_852.htm">Strong's 852: </a> </span><span class="str2">A portent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and wonders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;im&#183;hay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8540.htm">Strong's 8540: </a> </span><span class="str2">A miracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1768.htm">Strong's 1768: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, that, because</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Most High</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;il&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5943.htm">Strong's 5943: </a> </span><span class="str2">highest', a name of God</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#257;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_426.htm">Strong's 426: </a> </span><span class="str2">God</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has performed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5648.htm">Strong's 5648: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make, prepare, keep</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for me:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5974.htm">Strong's 5974: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/4-2.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 4:2 It has seemed good to me (Dan.
