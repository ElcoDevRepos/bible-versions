In the context of <a href="/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, this is widely understood to be Alexander the Great, the king of Macedonia, who rose to power in the 4th century BC. Alexander's conquests were unprecedented, and he established one of the largest empires in ancient history. His rise was swift and marked by significant military victories, including the defeat of the Persian Empire. This aligns with the prophetic vision in Daniel, which often uses symbolic language to describe historical events and figures.<p><b>who will rule with great authority</b><br>Alexander's rule was characterized by his absolute authority and the vast extent of his empire, which stretched from Greece to Egypt and into parts of India. His ability to command and control such a diverse and expansive territory was unparalleled at the time. This phrase highlights the extent of his power and the centralized control he maintained over his empire. Historically, Alexander's authority was not just military but also cultural, as he spread Greek culture and language throughout his empire, a period known as the Hellenistic Age.<p><b>and do as he pleases</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the autonomy and unchecked power of Alexander's reign. He was known for his bold and decisive actions, often acting according to his own will without opposition. This reflects the historical accounts of his campaigns and the way he managed his empire. Alexander's ability to act freely and implement his strategies without significant resistance is a testament to his dominance and the fear he instilled in both his allies and enemies. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human power, as even the mightiest rulers are subject to the sovereignty of God, a recurring theme in the book of Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_king.htm">Mighty King</a></b><br>This refers to a powerful ruler who will emerge with significant authority.

According to the context he might be either a Greek or a Persian, or he might belong to a kingdom not yet mentioned. Those who explain what follows to refer to the Ptolemies and Seleucidae identify him with Alexander the Great, and compare with this verse <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm" title="After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.">Daniel 7:6</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/8-5.htm" title="And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.">Daniel 8:5-8</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/8-21.htm" title="And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.">Daniel 8:21-22</a>. Certainly the self-will spoken of in this verse was characteristic of Alexander (comp. also <a href="/daniel/8-4.htm" title="I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.">Daniel 8:4</a>), but there was nothing in the context which makes it necessary to limit the passage to him. Some autocrat may arise "in the latter times" to whom it will apply with greater force than it did to Alexander.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with groat dominion, and do according to his will.</span> None of the versions imply any difference of reading. The Hebrew implies that the king was a mighty warrior. All critics are agreed that here the reference is to Alexander the Great. This does not mean that Alexander immediately followed Xerxes, but that his expedition was the revenge for that of Xerxes. Alexander, in his answer to Darius Codomannus, justified his invasion of Persia by referring back to Xerxes' invasion of Greece. The two expeditions, that which Xerxes made into Greece, and that of Alexander into Persia, might be regarded as causally connected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a mighty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(gib&#183;b&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1368.htm">Strong's 1368: </a> </span><span class="str2">Powerful, warrior, tyrant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will arise,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;ma&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who will rule</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#353;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4910.htm">Strong's 4910: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rule, have dominion, reign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7227.htm">Strong's 7227: </a> </span><span class="str2">Much, many, great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">authority</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;&#353;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4474.htm">Strong's 4474: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dominion, ruler</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as he pleases.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(kir&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7522.htm">Strong's 7522: </a> </span><span class="str2">Goodwill, favor, acceptance, will</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/11-3.htm">Daniel 11:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/11-3.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 11:3 A mighty king shall stand up who (Dan.
