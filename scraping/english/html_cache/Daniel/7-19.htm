The fourth beast represents a kingdom distinct from the previous ones, often interpreted as the Roman Empire. This empire's unique characteristics and its role in biblical prophecy make it a focal point for eschatological studies. The quest for understanding also mirrors the broader biblical theme of seeking wisdom and revelation from God, as seen in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.<p><b>which was different from all the others&#8212;extremely terrifying</b><br>The distinct nature of the fourth beast highlights its unprecedented power and influence. Unlike the previous empires symbolized by the other beasts, this one is described as "extremely terrifying," indicating its formidable strength and capacity for destruction. This aligns with historical accounts of the Roman Empire's military prowess and its impact on the ancient world. The terrifying aspect also points to the spiritual and moral implications of unchecked power, as seen in the warnings against oppressive rulers throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-3</a>.<p><b>devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws</b><br>The imagery of iron teeth and bronze claws suggests a combination of strength and durability, characteristics associated with the Roman Empire's military and political dominance. Iron and bronze are materials often used in biblical symbolism to denote strength and judgment, as seen in the statue of Nebuchadnezzar's dream in <a href="/daniel/2.htm">Daniel 2</a>. The devouring and crushing actions of the beast symbolize the empire's aggressive expansion and subjugation of other nations, reflecting the historical reality of Rome's conquests.<p><b>then trampling underfoot whatever was left</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the beast's destruction and its disregard for anything that remains. The trampling underfoot signifies complete domination and the obliteration of resistance, a theme echoed in the prophetic literature concerning the fate of nations that oppose God's purposes. This imagery also foreshadows the ultimate defeat of oppressive powers in the eschatological vision of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>, where Christ triumphs over the forces of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Book of Daniel, known for his faithfulness to God and his ability to interpret dreams and visions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fourth_beast.htm">The Fourth Beast</a></b><br>Represents a kingdom or empire that is distinct from the previous ones, characterized by its terrifying nature and destructive power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/iron_teeth_and_bronze_claws.htm">Iron Teeth and Bronze Claws</a></b><br>Symbolic elements that emphasize the strength and destructive capability of the fourth beast.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_the_four_beasts.htm">Vision of the Four Beasts</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Daniel, depicting four beasts that represent successive empires or kingdoms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The setting of Daniel's life and ministry, where he served under several kings and received his visions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophetic_imagery.htm">Understanding Prophetic Imagery</a></b><br>The use of vivid imagery in Daniel's vision serves to convey the seriousness and impact of future events.

I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom</span>. In regard to the version of the LXX. here, we have the advantage of Justin Martyr's transcription, in which, however, the difference from the Chigi texts are not of great importance. The LXX. here is pretty close to the Masseretic text. "Behold" has intruded into the text; it is, however, omitted from Justin Martyr. Another clause, evidently a doublet, is emitted also, and the clause assumes nearly the shape it has in Theodotion. It is difficult to imagine how the reading of the LXX. arose. The differences from the Massoretic text are for the rest not essential. This is the case with Theodotion and the Peshitta. These verses to some extent recapitulate the earlier description of this fourth beast. There are, however, features added - to the "iron teeth" of the seventh verse are added "claws of brass." The main change is in regard to the little horn that came up last. We not only learn here that three other horns were plucked up before it, but the personification is now carried further, and the horn makes war against the saints, and prevails against them. This description does not suit Epiphanes. He certainly made war against the saints, but as certainly he did not prevail against them. When he came up from Egypt, and entered into the sanctuary and plundered it, he could not be said to make war against Israel. Judaea was one of his own provinces. When a tyrannical government takes possession of the wealth and property of individuals or corporations, it may be called cruel and oppressive, but its conduct is not called war. Even the massacre of the inhabitants of Jerusalem by the collector of taxes was not war. There was no war levied by Epiphanes against the saints till Mattathias and his sons rebelled, and thereafter Epiphanes did not prevail against the Jews. The Romans did make war against Israel, and did prevail. If the saints are a nation, then Epiphanes did not prevail in war against them If persecution is to be regarded as warfare, then it is not warfare against a nation, but against a community like a Church. If we look upon the Christian Church as succeeding to the position of Israel, then Rome persecuted the Church, and persecution ceased only when Rome became Christian. But a wider view opens itself to us. All modern states are in a sense a continuance of Rome, and so far as they do not submit themselves to the direction of Christ, they are still at war with the saints. It is only when the Son of man comes in his power that the kingdom will belong to the saints. It is to be observed, the figure of an assize is still kept up, and "judgment is given to" or "for the saints," and in virtue of this decision they possess the kingdom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/7-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I wanted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6634.htm">Strong's 6634: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be inclined, desire, be pleased</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to know the true meaning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ya&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
