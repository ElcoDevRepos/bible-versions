In biblical literature, trees often represent kingdoms or rulers (<a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>). The beauty signifies prosperity and the flourishing state of the empire under Nebuchadnezzar's reign.<p><b>its fruit was abundant</b><br>The abundance of fruit indicates the wealth and resources of Babylon. This reflects the economic prosperity and the ability of the kingdom to provide for its people and others. In a broader biblical context, fruitfulness is often associated with God's blessing (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p><b>and upon it was food for all</b><br>This phrase highlights the provision and sustenance that the kingdom of Babylon offered to its inhabitants and neighboring nations. It suggests a time of peace and stability, where the empire was a source of nourishment and support, reminiscent of the role of a benevolent ruler.<p><b>Under it the beasts of the field found shelter</b><br>The beasts finding shelter under the tree symbolize the protection and security offered by Nebuchadnezzar's rule. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a king was often seen as a shepherd to his people, providing safety and care (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>).<p><b>in its branches the birds of the air nested</b><br>The nesting birds represent the diverse peoples and nations that found refuge and a place within the Babylonian Empire. This imagery is echoed in the parables of Jesus, where the kingdom of God is likened to a mustard seed that grows into a tree, providing shelter for the birds (<a href="/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-32</a>).<p><b>and from it every creature was fed</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive reach and influence of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. It suggests a universal provision, where all creation benefits from the resources and stability provided by the empire. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provider and sustainer of all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who has the dream of the great tree, symbolizing his vast empire and influence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel (Belteshazzar)</a></b><br>The prophet and interpreter of dreams who explains the meaning of Nebuchadnezzar's dream.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire over which Nebuchadnezzar reigns, represented by the tree in the dream.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_tree.htm">The Great Tree</a></b><br>Symbolizes Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom, providing sustenance and shelter to many.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_messenger.htm">Heavenly Messenger</a></b><br>Later in the chapter, a messenger from heaven decrees the tree's fate, symbolizing divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_kingdoms.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Kingdoms</a></b><br>The dream illustrates that earthly kingdoms, no matter how powerful, are under God's control and subject to His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/provision_and_responsibility.htm">Provision and Responsibility</a></b><br>Just as the tree provides for all creatures, those in positions of power have a responsibility to care for those under their influence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pride_and_humility.htm">Pride and Humility</a></b><br>Nebuchadnezzar's dream serves as a warning against pride.

As already mentioned, this verse occurs before the one we have just been considering. It differs, like it, more than can be explained by a mistake in reading the Massoretic Aramaic; if it were translated from a cuneiform document, it is easily imaginable in what form the statement might be made. The reading, however, is not an unlikely one in the description of a dream, if we could have imagined the Indian banyan tree to have been known to the authors of this version, we might have understood the tree of the dream to have been like it. Theodotion is at one with the Massoretic text, as also the Peshitta. Whether we take the symbol of a tree used for the Babylonian empire, as drawn from the Babylonian tree of life, or merely devised by the poetic fancy of the monarch, inspired for the time, it must be recognized as very apt. From the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, it stretched from the cataracts of the Nile in all probability into Asia Minor. Over all this empire the monarch maintained the attitude of an earthly providence. It was because government was strong that peaceable men could live. It is useless to carry the similitude into the minutiae of Jephet-ibn-Ali, who maintains that the wild beasts are the nomads of the deserts, and the birds the strangers that came to Nebuchadnezzar from far. In the Aramaic here there are traces of the antiquity in the language: the use of <span class="accented">inbbaya</span>, "fruit," instead of <span class="accented">ibbaya</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> one instance. <span class="accented">Saggeee</span> (with <span class="accented">sin</span>) is a proof that the distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> was still understood, and probably beard. It is remarked by Keil that this word does not really mean "much," but rather "great," "strong." Although it is undeniable that he is correct as to the primitive meaning of the word, it can scarcely mean anything else than "<span class="accented">much"</span> in the present connection. <span class="accented">Mazon</span>, "food," is rare as a Biblical word, but occurs in Genesis as well as Chronicles. Professor Bevan quotes Noldeke in favour of a Mandaean origin for it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Its leaves</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
