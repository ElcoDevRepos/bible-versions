This reflects the absolute authority of King Nebuchadnezzar over his realm. Decrees were often used to enforce laws or summon individuals for specific purposes. The king's reliance on decrees highlights the centralized power structure of Babylonian governance.<p><b>that all the wise men of Babylon</b><br>Babylon was renowned for its scholars and wise men, including magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and diviners. These individuals were considered experts in interpreting dreams and omens, a common practice in Mesopotamian culture. The mention of "all the wise men" indicates the king's desperation and the importance he placed on understanding his dream.

The king will not settle for second-hand reports (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a> where Joseph is rushed &#8220;quickly&#8221; to Pharaoh).<p>&#8226; The throne room becomes a courtroom: human savants must answer, yet the real judge is the Most High who &#8220;brings princes to nothing&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God is orchestrating events so the impotence of the wise men will be witnessed firsthand, magnifying His glory when Daniel later arrives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to interpret the dream</b><p>&#8226; Interpretation, not mere recollection, is sought; the king already knows the dream (unlike in chapter 2).

Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s decree, the assembly of wise men, their summons before the throne, the quest for interpretation, and the king&#8217;s personal stake all combine to demonstrate that the Most High rules over the affairs of men and that His revelation, not earthly expertise, holds the final word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream.

These verses do not occur in the LXX. Theodotion is a somewhat slavish translation of the Massoretic text, "From me there was set up (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) a decree to summon before me all the wise men of Babylon," etc. The Peshitta is somewhat freer, but as close to the Massoretic text. Still, the want of the verses in the Septuagint would throw a doubt on their authenticity, even if there were nothing in the verses themselves to make them liable to suspicion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;min&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
