Arrogance in the biblical context often signifies a turning away from God, as pride leads individuals to rely on their own strength rather than acknowledging God's sovereignty. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall," which is exemplified in Nebuchadnezzar's life. His arrogance is a cautionary tale about the dangers of self-exaltation.<p><b>and his spirit was hardened with pride</b><br>A hardened spirit indicates a resistance to divine influence and correction. In the biblical narrative, a hardened heart often leads to judgment, as seen with Pharaoh in Exodus. Nebuchadnezzar's prideful spirit prevented him from recognizing God's authority, leading to his downfall. This hardening is a spiritual condition that blinds individuals to truth and righteousness, emphasizing the need for humility before God.<p><b>he was deposed from his royal throne</b><br>The deposition of Nebuchadnezzar from his throne is a direct consequence of his pride and serves as a fulfillment of divine prophecy. <a href="/daniel/4-31.htm">Daniel 4:31-32</a> records God's warning to Nebuchadnezzar that his kingdom would be taken from him until he acknowledged God's sovereignty. This event underscores the biblical principle that God is the ultimate authority over earthly rulers, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is established by God.<p><b>and his glory was taken from him</b><br>The removal of Nebuchadnezzar's glory signifies the loss of his power, honor, and majesty. In biblical terms, glory often represents the visible manifestation of God's presence and favor. When Nebuchadnezzar's glory was taken, it symbolized God's judgment and the stripping away of what was not rightfully his. This serves as a reminder that human glory is temporary and ultimately subject to God's will, as echoed in <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>, where God declares He will not share His glory with another.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/belshazzar.htm">Belshazzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon during the events of <a href="/bsb/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.
