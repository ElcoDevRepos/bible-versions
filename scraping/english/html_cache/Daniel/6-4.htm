Their attempt to find a charge against Daniel reflects the political intrigue and jealousy common in ancient courts. Daniel, a Jewish exile, had risen to a position of significant influence, which likely provoked envy among native officials. This scenario echoes the experiences of other biblical figures like Joseph, who also faced false accusations due to his integrity and favor with God (Genesis 39).<p><b>but they could find no charge or corruption</b><br>Daniel's life was marked by integrity and faithfulness, making it difficult for his adversaries to find any legitimate fault. This mirrors the biblical principle that a righteous life can withstand scrutiny (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>). The absence of corruption in Daniel's conduct is significant, especially in a context where corruption was rampant. His blamelessness prefigures the sinlessness of Christ, who also faced false accusations but was found without fault (<a href="/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>).<p><b>because he was trustworthy</b><br>Daniel's trustworthiness was rooted in his unwavering faith in God. His consistent character and reliability were evident to all, including his enemies. This quality is essential for those in leadership, as seen in the New Testament qualifications for church leaders (<a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>). Daniel's trustworthiness also highlights the biblical theme of God rewarding faithfulness, as seen in his continued protection and promotion.<p><b>and no negligence or corruption was found in him</b><br>The absence of negligence or corruption underscores Daniel's diligence and moral integrity. In a culture where bribery and deceit were common, Daniel's exemplary conduct set him apart. This phrase emphasizes the biblical call to live above reproach (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).

Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</span> The rendering of the Septuagint is here very paraphrastic, "Then the two young men (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) took counsel, and planned among themselves with each other, saying, Since they found no error nor neglect (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) against Daniel, about which they might accuse him to the king, and they said, Come, let us make a decree (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) among ourselves, that no man shall make any request, or offer any prayer, to any god for thirty days, but only from Darius the king, and if not he shall die; in order that they might lower (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) Daniel before the king, and that he be thrown into the den of lions; for they knew that Daniel prayed and made supplication to the Lord his God three times a day." There are elements here of interpolation and of the coalescence of different renderings. It is difficult to understand how "the presidents" could be called <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. There seems no Aramaic word with that meaning, into which <span class="accented">sarekeen</span> could be read; certainly it is as difficult to imagine any one thinking of introducing that as a logical equivalent. Young men would not be put in such a responsible place, nor would they have thought of Daniel - a man of about eighty years - as a colleague with youths. There are evident traces of two readings having coalesced; thus we have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> followed by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, after the course of the narrative has been interrupted by an inserted clause. As to the punishment to befall the <span class="accented">transgressor</span> of this decree, one statement is, "If not, he shall die" The next version of the punishment is brought into connection with the humiliation to be inflicted on Daniel, that "he may be cast into the den of lions." At the same time, the fact that we hear of the decree in connection with the consultation of these conspirators in the present text, is in harmony with what we find in the fourth chapter. In the original document not improbably the statement would be given - as in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. in regard to Pharaoh's dreams - alike when the conspirators devise the plan, and when they carry it out. In regard to some of the differences, an explanation may be hazarded, but we will not delay. Notwithstanding that the Massoretic here is shorter than the Greek text, we fancy it is not difficult through it to find a shorter text still. The text of Theodotion is much briefer than either of the other texts, "And the presidents (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel, and they found neither occasion, nor fault, nor error against him, because he was faithful. And the presidents said, We shall not find occasion against Daniel except in regard to precepts (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) of his God." The Peshitta agrees in the main with the Massoretic. It makes Daniel faithful "towards God." That these co-presidents and the under-governors should be indignant that a Jew, who had actually been employed in the court of Nabunahid, should be put above those Babylonians who had admitted the shields of Guti into Esakkil, was natural. Of course, they could not seriously plead this before the governor Gobryas. They could not accuse Daniel directly of worshipping his national Deity, for the Persian rule in:Babylon, while zealous for the gods of Babylon, did not imply any assault on the deities of other subject races. It is to be noted that in the Septuagint the plot is concoeted by the two "youths," Daniel's co-presidents. They, most likely men of high rank, would feel most keenly that they were superseded by a Jew, and their feelings would naturally spread to those beneath them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1491;&#1463;&#1448;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_116.htm">Strong's 116: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, thereupon</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the administrators</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7733;ay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural determinate<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5632.htm">Strong's 5632: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chief, overseer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and satraps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;a&#353;&#183;dar&#183;p&#601;&#183;nay&#183;y&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
