This mirrors the unchangeable nature of God's decrees, emphasizing divine sovereignty.<p><b>the men who had falsely accused Daniel</b><br>These men represent the forces of evil and deception, akin to Satan, the accuser of the brethren (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).

It also serves as a warning about the impact of one's actions on others.<p><b>And before they had reached the bottom of the den</b><br>This detail emphasizes the immediacy and inevitability of divine justice. It contrasts with Daniel's miraculous preservation, highlighting God's protection over His faithful servants. The swift judgment serves as a testament to God's power and righteousness.<p><b>the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones</b><br>The lions' ferocity underscores the reality of God's judgment against sin. This imagery of bones being crushed is a vivid depiction of total destruction, paralleling the fate of the wicked in <a href="/psalms/34-21.htm">Psalm 34:21</a>.

In this account of the punishment meted out to the accusers of Daniel, the victims are only two, with their wives and children. Hitzig contemptuously remarks that the lions' den must have been large to contain a hundred and twenty-two men along with their families - that number he gets by adding to the governors of the provinces the two presidents,colleagues of Daniel. If, however, we assume the Septuagint text to be correct, then this objection falls to the ground. The phrase "or ever they came at the bottom of the den," is an intensification of the narrative. In the Massoretic text it is "all their bones;" in the LXX. it is simply "their bones." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The slaughter of the wives and children of offenders, with the guilty persons themselves, was the common practice. There are two other accounts of this event - one preserved in the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon, and the other in the pages of Josephus. According to the story of Bel and the Dragon, the king, who thus condemns Daniel, is no less a person than Cyrus the great conqueror. The reason of the condemnation is not a decree forbidding all worship, but because Daniel had laid bare the deceit of the priests of Bel, and killed the sacred dragon, the people of Babylon were incensed, and threatened Cyrus that they would burn his house if he did not deliver Daniel into their hands to be cast into the lions' den. The seven lions were starved in order that they might be sure to devour Daniel. For six days he was there in the den. In order that Daniel might not starve, whatever befell the lions, Habacuc was brought from Judaea, carried by the hair of his head, to feed the prophet. The destruction of Daniel's accusers is stated in a mere compendious fashion. The fact that this version is referred to by Irenaeus ('Adv. Haeres.,' 4.), Tertullian ('De Jejuniis,' 7.), and Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' 1. p. 329, Morel), shows that early in the second century this narrative was incorporated with the canonical Daniel. This makes it almost necessarily before Christ in the date of its origin. If so, it is difficult to imagine the canonical version to be only a century and a half older. Josephus shows no signs that he knew of this apocryphal addition, but adds a feature for himself, "The enemies of Daniel, when they saw that nothing evil had befallen him, unwilling to attribute his deliverance to Deity and his providence, declared that the lions had been filled with food, and therefore neither attacked Daniel nor approached him, and maintained this to the king. But he, hating their malice, ordered that much flesh be thrown to the lions, and when they had gorged themselves, that the enemies of Daniel be cast into the den, in order that he might learn whether the lions would spare them on account of their being satisfied. It was then manifest to Darius, when the satraps had been thrown in, that Daniel had been preserved by miracle, for the lions spared none of them, but tore them all to pieces as if they had been famishing." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the command</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
