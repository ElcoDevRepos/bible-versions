This reflects a common biblical theme where individuals seek God in times of need or uncertainty (e.g., <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>). The phrase indicates a conscious choice to prioritize communication with God, emphasizing the importance of intentionality in prayer.<p><b>to seek Him by prayer and petition</b><br>Prayer and petition are central to Daniel's approach, highlighting the dual aspects of communication with God: worship and request. Prayer is a broader term encompassing adoration, confession, and thanksgiving, while petition specifically refers to requests made to God. This reflects the biblical principle of presenting one's needs to God (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>) and underscores the relational aspect of faith.<p><b>with fasting</b><br>Fasting is a spiritual discipline that involves abstaining from food to focus on spiritual matters. In the biblical context, fasting is often associated with repentance, mourning, or seeking God's favor (e.g., <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12</a>). It demonstrates humility and dependence on God, as seen in other scriptural examples like <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16-18</a>.<p><b>sackcloth</b><br>Sackcloth, a coarse material made from goat's hair, was traditionally worn as a sign of mourning or repentance. Its use in the Bible often accompanies expressions of deep sorrow or contrition (e.g., <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). Wearing sackcloth symbolizes a physical manifestation of inner humility and penitence before God.<p><b>and ashes</b><br>Ashes, like sackcloth, are a symbol of mourning and repentance. Sprinkling ashes on oneself was a common practice in the ancient Near East to express grief or penitence (e.g., <a href="/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>). This act signifies a recognition of human frailty and sinfulness, aligning with the biblical theme of repentance and the need for divine mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daniel.htm">Daniel</a></b><br>A prophet and a key figure in the Babylonian and Persian empires, known for his unwavering faith and devotion to God.

The true rendering is, as Professor Bevan points out," to set to prayer." Theodotion is nearly as slavish; only he omits "ashes," and has "fastings." The Peshitta is close, but does not follow the change of construction in the last clause. Jerome seems to have read, "my God." The cessation of the temple-worship, with its sacrifices, was naturally fitted to bring prayer as a mode of worship into a prominence it bad not before. Yet we find prayers made while the first temple was yet standing, as the prayer of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>), of Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>).
