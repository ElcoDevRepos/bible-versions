The context is the decree that Daniel violated by praying to God, which was manipulated by the satraps to trap him. The king's quick response shows his concern and the gravity of the situation. Historically, Persian kings were seen as absolute rulers, yet Darius's reaction reveals his personal regard for Daniel, highlighting the tension between royal decrees and personal relationships.<p><b>he was deeply distressed</b><br>The king's distress underscores his emotional turmoil and the moral conflict he faces. This reaction is significant because it shows that Darius valued Daniel highly, likely due to Daniel's integrity and the favor he had found in the king's eyes. The distress also reflects the king's awareness of the irreversible nature of Medo-Persian laws, which even he could not change, illustrating the rigidity of the legal system of the time.<p><b>and set his mind on delivering Daniel</b><br>Darius's determination to save Daniel demonstrates his respect and affection for him. This phrase suggests a king who is not only a ruler but also a man of conscience, willing to seek a solution despite the legal constraints. It highlights the king's internal struggle and his desire to act justly, which is a recurring theme in biblical narratives where leaders are faced with moral dilemmas.<p><b>and he labored until sundown to rescue him</b><br>The king's efforts until sundown indicate the urgency and intensity of his attempts to find a legal loophole or a way to save Daniel. This reflects the cultural practice of resolving matters before the end of the day, as well as the king's commitment to justice. The mention of "sundown" may also symbolize the end of hope from a human perspective, setting the stage for divine intervention. This mirrors other biblical accounts where human efforts reach their limits, and God's power is then revealed, drawing a parallel to the ultimate deliverance found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_darius.htm">King Darius</a></b><br>The ruler of the Medo-Persian Empire who was tricked into signing a decree that endangered Daniel.

Moments earlier he had confidently signed an irrevocable law (<a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8&#8211;9</a>). Now he realizes the snare he has walked into.<p>&#8226; His instant recognition shows he understands exactly who &#8220;this&#8221; affects&#8212;Daniel, his most trusted servant (<a href="/daniel/6-2.htm">Daniel 6:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights pivotal moments that turn on a single report: Joseph&#8217;s brothers telling Jacob a lie (<a href="/genesis/37-32.htm">Genesis 37:32&#8211;33</a>), or the messengers informing David of Absalom&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13&#8211;14</a>). In each case, decisive choices follow swiftly.<p>&#8226; Here, the speed of Darius&#8217; awareness foreshadows both the danger for Daniel and the rescue God will provide, echoing <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was deeply distressed</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Deeply distressed&#8221; paints a vivid picture of a ruler&#8217;s anguish. This is no small annoyance; it is a gut-level grief.<p>&#8226; Think of King Herod&#8217;s similar agitation when he realized his rash oath endangered John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-26.htm">Mark 6:26</a>). Leaders often discover too late that their own decrees can entrap the innocent.<p>&#8226; Darius&#8217; distress also exposes the conflict between worldly power and genuine righteousness. Daniel&#8217;s faithful life has pierced the king&#8217;s conscience (compare <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>, where Felix becomes afraid when confronted with truth).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s sadness underscores God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>: &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him&#8221;. Daniel&#8217;s integrity moves the heart of a pagan monarch.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And set his mind on delivering Daniel</b><p>&#8226; Distress quickly turns to determination. The phrase shows resolve, not wishful thinking.<p>&#8226; In the face of an unalterable law (<a href="/daniel/6-15.htm">Daniel 6:15</a>; <a href="/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>), Darius still searches for any loophole. His commitment mirrors Pontius Pilate&#8217;s repeated attempts to release Jesus (<a href="/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s intent also illustrates <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>: &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases&#8221;. God is steering Darius toward protecting His servant, even before the miracle in the lions&#8217; den.<p>&#8226; Daniel&#8217;s earlier resolve &#8220;not to defile himself&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>) now inspires a king to set his own heart to save him&#8212;a testimony to the contagious power of steadfast faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he labored until sundown to rescue him</b><p>&#8226; The day&#8217;s light becomes a ticking clock. Persian protocol typically executed sentences the same day, so Darius has only until sunset.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;labor&#8221; suggests exhaustive legal consultation, frantic searching of statutes, and perhaps personal pleas with the scheming officials. Compare <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, where urgency drives decisive action before a critical deadline.<p>&#8226; Despite the king&#8217;s tireless efforts, the law stands. This failure highlights humanity&#8217;s limitations and sets the stage for God&#8217;s direct intervention, echoing <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3&#8211;6</a>, which warns against trusting princes but celebrates the LORD who keeps faith forever.<p>&#8226; Darius&#8217; perseverance until nightfall foreshadows the greater darkness of the sealed den&#8212;and the coming dawn when God will vindicate Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-19.htm">Daniel 6:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14</a> reveals a king&#8217;s immediate shock, heartfelt grief, resolute purpose, and exhaustive effort to save a righteous man he admires. Yet even a monarch&#8217;s best intentions cannot overturn human law&#8212;only God can. The verse spotlights the tension between earthly authority and divine sovereignty, preparing us to witness the Lord&#8217;s deliverance that no decree can prevent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
