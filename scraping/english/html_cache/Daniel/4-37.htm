The verse invites us to join Nebuchadnezzar in genuine praise, daily humility, and unwavering trust in the righteous rule of the King of heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/daniel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">The King of heaven.--</span>How far the king arrived at a belief in one God is not clear. There may be noticed, however, a progress in his spiritual character, effected by the grace of God, after each of the interviews which he held with the prophet. At first (<a href="/daniel/2-26.htm" title="The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?">Daniel 2:26</a>) his belief was no higher than that which a heathen has in his own superstitions. This develops (<a href="/daniel/2-47.htm" title="The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.">Daniel 2:47</a>) into a belief that Daniel's God is "a God of gods, a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets." But even at that time he had not arrived at anything like a belief that Jehovah was equal to his own gods. The story of the three holy children shows how little depth there was in his former profession, for in <a href="/daniel/3-15.htm" title="Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?">Daniel 3:15</a> he is represented as setting himself above all gods. After the miracle wrought in their behalf he acknowledges Jehovah to be "the most high God," though he continued to regard Him as only on a level with his own Bel-Merodach. This chapter represents him as recognising "the Most High" to be the cause of his recovery, and as praising the "King of heaven." Holding, as he did, the Babylonian theory of sickness, he must have supposed himself to have been under the influence of some evil spirit; and, with a view to his recovery, his magicians must have treated his disease with charms, amulets, exorcisms, and by placing before him images of his gods. This thanksgiving makes it possible to suppose that he had relinquished much of his belief in his former superstitions, and that he was advancing towards, if not actually in possession of, the truth.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</span> The Septuagint Version has all the appearance of an original composition by a scribe, not impossibly in imitation of the Song of the Three Holy Children, taking as its theme the subject of the verse before us, "I confess and praise the Highest, who created the heaven and the earth and the sea. He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, and King of kings, because he doeth signs and wonders, and changeth seasons and times, taking away the kingdoms of kings and setting up others instead of them. Now from this time I shall worship him, and from fear of him trembling hath taken hold of me, and all the holy ones I praise, for the gods of the nations have not power in themselves to turn away the kingdom of a king to another king, and to kill and to make alive, and to do signs and marvels great and fearful; and to change very great matters according as the God of heaven did to me, and charged to me great things. I will offer sacrifices to the Highest every day of nay reign for my life, for a savour of sweet smell before the Lord, and what is pleasing before him I shall do, and the people and my nation and the countries which are in my dominion. And as many as shall speak against the God of heaven, and as many as shall be taken saying anything, these shall I condemn to death." Several of the phrases in this short hymn - for that it rather is than a version of an Aramaic original - are derived from other portions of Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "for a savour of a sweet smell before the Lord." There are traces also of the familiar phenomenon of "doublets." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. So far as the Massoretic text represents the original Daniel, there is no evidence that Nebuchadnezzar had ceased to be a worshipper of Bel-Marduk and Nebo and Nergal. Certainly he recognizes that Jehovah is to be worshipped also. Further, it is to be admitted that Nebuchadnezzar carries his adoration very near the point of true and exclusive worship. In what he came short it may be that he yielded to the political necessities of his situation - as Naaman bowing in the temple of Rimmon. Even an autocrat like Nebuchadnezzar would be conditioned by those who served him, and after his madness he would be specially under the power of those officials who had restored him to his place. <span class="accented">Excursus on Nebuchadnezzar's Madness.</span> The events of the fourth chapter of Daniel are full of elements that have caused question from the days of Porphyry downwards. Many of these have been discussed as they occurred in the narrative. The question of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar has several features which cause it to be of interest. Some of these have been passingly treated in reference to the passages in which they are mentioned. But to a thorough understanding of the matter it is well to collect these features together and discuss it as a whole. To do so effectively, we shall have to consider <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the nature of the disease under which Nebuchadnezzar suffered; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the length of time during which he was under it; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> what evidence there is in the narrative, or on the monuments, of political changes during the time he was incapacitated.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/4-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3705.htm">Strong's 3705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_576.htm">Strong's 576: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nebuchadnezzar,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#7733;a&#7695;&#183;ne&#7779;&#183;&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5020.htm">Strong's 5020: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebuchadnezzar -- a Babylonian king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">praise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#353;ab&#183;ba&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7624.htm">Strong's 7624: </a> </span><span class="str2">To adulate, adore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and exalt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
