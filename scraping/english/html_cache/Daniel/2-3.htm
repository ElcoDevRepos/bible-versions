In the Babylonian court, these groups were considered wise men and were often consulted for their supposed ability to interpret dreams and omens. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the significance of dreams as messages from the divine. The king's reliance on these advisors highlights the cultural and religious practices of Babylon, which were steeped in polytheism and divination.<p><b>I have had a dream</b><br>Dreams in the ancient world, particularly in the context of the Bible, were often seen as a means through which God or the gods communicated with humans. In the Old Testament, dreams are frequently used by God to reveal His plans or to provide guidance, as seen with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> and Pharaoh's dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. Nebuchadnezzar's dream is significant because it sets the stage for God's revelation through Daniel, contrasting the wisdom of God with the limitations of human understanding and pagan practices.<p><b>and my spirit is anxious</b><br>The king's anxiety reflects the belief that dreams could be omens of future events, often causing fear or concern if their meaning was not understood. This anxiety underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the inability of Nebuchadnezzar's advisors to provide true insight. It also sets the stage for Daniel's role as God's chosen interpreter, emphasizing the peace and understanding that come from divine revelation. The king's troubled spirit can be compared to Pharaoh's distress in <a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>, where only God's servant could provide the true interpretation.<p><b>to understand it</b><br>The desire to understand the dream highlights the human quest for knowledge and the limitations of earthly wisdom. In the biblical narrative, true understanding comes from God, as seen in Daniel's ability to interpret the dream through divine revelation. This theme is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, which states, "For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding." The king's quest for understanding ultimately points to the sovereignty of God and His control over the affairs of nations, as revealed in the subsequent interpretation of the dream.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who has a troubling dream that he seeks to understand.

However, it is more in accordance with what is stated about the anxious condition of the king's mind to assume that he remembered a portion of the dream, but that he had lost the general outline of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</span> The Revised Version improves the English of the verse by putting the verb in the present, "My Spirit is troubled to know the dream." The Septuagint Version has the appearance of a paraphrase, "And the king said to them, I have seen a dream, and my spirit is troubled, and I desire to understand the dream." It is an unusual combination "to see a dream;" from its unusualness the reading of the Septuagint is to be preferred. In old Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">z</span>) are not unlike each other, nor are <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> (<span class="accented">m</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">y</span>). Yet these two, letters are the only differences between <span class="accented">halamti</span>, "I have dreamed." and <span class="accented">hazithi.</span> "I have seen." The Peshitta has <span class="accented">haloma hazith</span>, which gives the same combination, and would indicate that here too the Aramaic original is shining through It is however, difficult to see how such a word as <span class="accented">ahpatz.</span> "I wish," could drop out of the Massoretic. The must natural solution is that the translator added <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> to complete the sense. Certainly a link is awanting as it stands in the ordinary interpretation of this verse. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, while the Vulgate paraphrases the last clause, "And the king said to them. I have seen a dream, and confused in mind I have forgot what I saw." The king has been perturbed by the dream, and his perturbation leads him to wish to knew the dream - not necessarily what the dream actually had been, but what it meant. Thus in <a href="/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a> Daniel had understanding "in all visions and dreams;" this meant that he knew the meaning of dreams and visit us. The other versions give us no assistance to explain this. Archdeacon Rose says, "The king here plainly intimates that, though the dream had troubled and perplexed him. he could not remember what it was." It does not appear to us quite so plain It is certainly not impossible to imagine that, while the king had been strongly affected by the dream, he might not remember distinctly what it was. If, however, he had no remembrance of the dream, and only the feeling of perturbation, any grandiose vision might have been brought before him, and he would not have been able to check it, or say that was not the dream he had had. If, again, he had some fragmentary remembrance, he naturally would have told what he remembered, in order that they might reconstruct his dream for him. Nebuchadnezzar's great purpose is not merely to see again his dream, but really to test these soothsayers that promised so much. If they could with such certainty as they professed tell what was about to happen, surely it was no great demand that they should know this dream of his. The king seems merely to have made the general statement, and left the soothsayers to tell at once the dream and interpretation. There sits the king with troubled brow, and there stand before him the principal adepts at interpretation of dreams. Some have found it a difficulty that God should reveal the future to a heathen monarch. But in the parallel case of Pharaoh this occurred; certainly the future revealed to him was the immediate future of the, land he ruled, whereas the dream of Nebuchadnezzar extended in its revelation to the very end of time. Archdeacon Rose refers to Pilate's wife and her mysterious dream at the trial of our Lord. The revelation as given to Nebuchadnezzar served a double purpose - it gave emphasis to it when, not an obscure Hebrew scholar got the vision, but the great conqueror; further, it gave an occasion for bringing Daniel into prominence, and gave thus to trim and to his companions an opportunity of showing their fidelity to God. This gave an occasion for miracles, the effect of which was to strengthen the Jews in their faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/daniel/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said to them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;I have had a dream,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2472.htm">Strong's 2472: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and my spirit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is anxious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1506;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tip&#183;p&#257;&#183;&#8216;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6470.htm">Strong's 6470: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tap, beat regularly, to impel, agitate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to understand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2472.htm">Strong's 2472: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dream</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/daniel/2-3.htm">OT Prophets: Daniel 2:3 The king said to them I have (Dan.
