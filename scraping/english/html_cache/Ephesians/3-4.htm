The act of reading was significant in the early church, as letters were often read aloud to congregations. This highlights the importance of literacy and the communal aspect of early Christian worship. The phrase also suggests a continuity of thought, urging the reader to consider the context of Paul's message.<p><b>you will be able to understand</b><br>Paul emphasizes the capability of the readers to grasp the message he is conveying. This reflects the belief that spiritual truths can be comprehended by believers through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. It underscores the accessibility of divine wisdom to all Christians, not just a select few. This democratization of understanding is a key theme in Paul's writings, aligning with the idea that the gospel is for everyone.<p><b>my insight into the mystery of Christ,</b><br>The "mystery of Christ" refers to the previously hidden truth now revealed through the gospel&#8212;that Gentiles are fellow heirs with Israel, part of the same body, and sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus. This mystery was not fully understood in the Old Testament but is now made clear through the apostles and prophets. Paul's "insight" suggests a special revelation given to him, aligning with his role as an apostle to the Gentiles. This concept of mystery is also seen in <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>, where Paul speaks of the mystery hidden for ages but now revealed to the saints. The term "mystery" in a biblical context often refers to God's plan of salvation, which is now disclosed through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to explain the mystery of Christ, which was revealed to him by divine revelation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of early Christianity and the recipient of this epistle.

Scripture is meant to be opened, not shelved (cf. &#8220;I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers,&#8221; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>). Like the Bereans who &#8220;received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>), believers gain benefit only when eyes and hearts are on the text. Practical take-away: set aside focused moments with the Word so that what follows in the verse can become reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then</b><p>The little connective signals sequence and certainty. If the church will read, then results will follow&#8212;no guesswork. Scripture consistently ties obedient action to promised outcome: &#8220;But be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Paul&#8217;s &#8220;then&#8221; echoes his earlier &#8220;For this reason&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>; 3:1), showing how one truth builds upon another.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will be able to understand</b><p>God&#8217;s Word is not an indecipherable code. Reading with faith opens understanding: &#8220;Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-45.htm">Luke 24:45</a>). The Spirit bridges the gap between ink on a page and light in the heart (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>). Notice Paul&#8217;s confidence&#8212;&#8220;you will be able&#8221;&#8212;mirroring his assurance in <a href="/2_corinthians/1-13.htm">2 Corinthians 1:13</a> that believers can grasp what he writes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my insight</b><p>Paul is sharing something personally revealed to him by Christ: &#8220;For I did not receive it from man&#8230; but by revelation of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). His apostleship lends authority yet remains humble; he offers his Spirit-given insight so the whole body can grow. Peter affirms the value of Paul&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15</a>), underscoring its reliability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the mystery</b><p>A &#8220;mystery&#8221; in Scripture is a truth once hidden but now unveiled. Earlier Paul wrote, &#8220;the mystery was made known to me by revelation&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>). The veil is lifted; the plan is out in the open (<a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-26</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>). Reading Scripture is therefore an act of discovery, stepping into light God is eager to share.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of Christ</b><p>The centerpiece of the mystery is Jesus Himself&#8212;His person, work, and the uniting of Jew and Gentile into one body through the gospel (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). Every secret God reveals points to His Son: &#8220;In Him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). Paul&#8217;s life purpose was to make Christ known: &#8220;I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>). Understanding the mystery means knowing Christ more deeply and living in the unity He secured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a> promises that intentional reading of Scripture brings Spirit-enabled understanding of the once-hidden, now-revealed mystery centered in Jesus.
