The word "now" suggests a specific moment in God's redemptive plan, highlighting the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant through Christ. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God's purposes unfold progressively, as seen in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, which speaks of the fullness of time when God sent His Son.<p><b>through the church</b><br>The church is central to God's plan, serving as the body of Christ on earth. This reflects the New Testament teaching that the church is the primary means through which God works in the world (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>). The church, composed of both Jews and Gentiles, represents the mystery revealed in Christ, as discussed earlier in <a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>. The church's role is to embody and proclaim the gospel, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>the manifold wisdom of God</b><br>The term "manifold" suggests a rich, multifaceted wisdom, indicating the complexity and depth of God's plan. This wisdom is not just intellectual but is demonstrated in the reconciliation of humanity through Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>, where Christ is described as the wisdom of God. The manifold wisdom also reflects God's ability to use diverse means and people to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout biblical history.<p><b>should be made known</b><br>This phrase emphasizes revelation and communication. God's wisdom is not meant to be hidden but revealed, particularly through the church's witness. This aligns with the biblical theme of revelation, where God makes known His will and character, as seen in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-26</a>, where the mystery of the gospel is revealed to all nations.<p><b>to the rulers and authorities</b><br>These terms often refer to spiritual beings, both good and evil, in the heavenly realms. This suggests that the church's role is not only earthly but cosmic, impacting the spiritual realm. <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a> speaks of Christ disarming these powers, indicating their subjugation through His work. The church's existence and mission demonstrate God's wisdom to these spiritual entities.<p><b>in the heavenly realms</b><br>This phrase points to the spiritual dimension of reality, which is a recurring theme in Ephesians (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 6</a>:12). It underscores the idea that the church's mission has implications beyond the physical world, affecting the spiritual order. This reflects the biblical worldview that acknowledges both visible and invisible realities, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>, which speaks of the eternal nature of the unseen.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to explain the mystery of the Gospel and the role of the church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The collective body of believers in Christ, through whom God's wisdom is revealed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_and_authorities_in_the_heavenly_realms.htm">Rulers and Authorities in the Heavenly Realms</a></b><br>Spiritual beings, both angelic and demonic, who observe the unfolding of God's plan through the church.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the church was established, known for its diverse culture and religious practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_manifold_wisdom_of_god.htm">The Manifold Wisdom of God</a></b><br>Refers to the multifaceted and complex wisdom of God, which is revealed through the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_as_god's_instrument.htm">The Church as God's Instrument</a></b><br>The church is not just a gathering of believers but a divine instrument through which God's wisdom is displayed to the spiritual realm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cosmic_scope_of_the_gospel.htm">The Cosmic Scope of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel's impact is not limited to earth;

That same sovereignty appears throughout Scripture:<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a> shows God foreknowing, predestining, calling, justifying, and glorifying His people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a> reminds us He &#8220;declares the end from the beginning.&#8221;<p><a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a> opens by anchoring everything that follows in this rock-solid intention of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that now</b><p>The word &#8220;now&#8221; signals a present, decisive moment. In <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a> &#8220;when the fullness of time had come,&#8221; Christ entered history; here, the &#8220;now&#8221; marks the era after the cross and resurrection when the mystery hidden for ages is unveiled (<a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>).

Paul echoes, &#8220;God&#8230;has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God&#8221; (Second Corinthians 4:6).

Earlier Paul said God seated us with Christ &#8220;in the heavenly realms&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>). That realm is real and populated; our earthly obedience reverberates there. <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a> pictures believers approaching &#8220;Mount Zion&#8230;the heavenly Jerusalem,&#8221; underscoring that the church&#8217;s true arena is larger than any earthly sanctuary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a> reveals a breathtaking vista: God&#8217;s eternal purpose has reached its &#8220;now&#8221; in Christ, and He has chosen the church&#8212;ordinary believers made one body&#8212;to exhibit His multifaceted wisdom. Our lives become a living sermon, preached not only to people but to the unseen rulers and authorities in the spiritual realm, all within the grand theater of the heavenly realms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) In this verse St. Paul passes on to consider the manifestation of God in Christ as brought home not only to the race of man but to the angels--"the principalities and powers in the heavenly places"--who are described (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>) as "desiring to look into" the consummation of the gospel mystery. In the same sense the Apostles, in their ministration of the gospel, are said to be a spectacle to angels and to men (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-9.htm" title="For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.">1Corinthians 4:9</a>); and in a magnificent passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>), Christians are encouraged in their warfare by knowing it to go on before "the city of the living God" and "an innumerable company of angels." The angels are, therefore, represented to us as not only ministering in the Church of Christ, but learning from its existence and fortunes to know more and more of the wisdom of God. Hence we gain a glimpse of a more than world-wide purpose in the supreme manifestation of God's mercy in Christ, fulfilled towards higher orders of God's rational creatures, aiding even them in progress towards the knowledge of God in Jesus Christ, which is life eternal. (There is a notable passage on a kindred idea in Butler's <span class= "ital">Analogy, </span>Part i., c. Iii. ? 5.) This world, itself a speck in the universe, may be--perhaps as a scene of exceptional rebellion against God, certainly as a scene of God's infinite goodness--a lesson to other spheres of being, far beyond our conception. Possibly this view of angels as our fellow-learners in the school of Christ may have been specially dwelt upon in view of the worship of angels of which we read in <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>; but it accords well with the wide sweep of thought characteristic of this Epistle, literally "gathering up all things in Christ."<p><span class= "bld">The manifold wisdom.</span>--The word "manifold" (properly, <span class= "ital">many-coloured, </span>or <span class= "ital">wrought in many details</span>) is used here (and nowhere else) for the wisdom of God, as "fulfilling itself in many ways" (the "sundry times and divers manners" of <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>). It is manifested, therefore, in the infinite variety both of the teaching and the life of the Church--manifold, yet one, as embodying but one life, the life of Jesus Christ. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the intent</span> - indicative of the purpose of the remarkable arrangement or dispensation according to which the eternal Divine purpose, which had been concealed from the beginning of the ages, was now made known - <span class="cmt_word">that there might b e made known to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places</span>; that a lesson might be given to the unfallen angels. Their interest in the scheme of man's redemption is often referred to (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>). Even the highest powers of heaven have yet much to learn respecting God. The dispensation of God's grace to man is one of their lesson-books. Dr. Chalmers shows ('Astronomical Discourses') how this meets the objection that so dread a sacrifice as the life of God's Son could not have been made for one poor planet; in its indirect bearings we do not know what other orders of beings have derived most vital lessons from this manifestation of the attributes of God. However men may scorn the salvation of Christ and all that belongs to it, the highest intelligences regard it with profound interest. <span class="cmt_word">By the Church the manifold wisdom of God.</span> Through the Church, now constituted, according' to the revealed mystery, of Jew and Gentile, all redeemed by Christ's blood and renewed by his Spirit, there is exhibited to the angels the manifold wisdom of God. The precise line of thought is this: God from eternity, had a purpose to put Jew and Gentile on precisely the same footing, but concealed it for many ages, until he revealed it in the apostolic age, when he appointed Paul his minister to announce it. The purpose of this whole arrangement was to enlighten the principalities and powers of heaven in the manifold wisdom of God. How in his manifold <span class="accented">wisdom?</span> In this way. During these preparatory ages, when God's gracious dealings were with the Jews only, all kinds of false religions were developing among <span class="accented">the</span> heathen, and their diversified influence and effects were becoming apparent in many ways - the divergent tendencies of men, especially in religious matters, were being developed; but in the new turn given to things by the breaking down of the middle wall in Christ, the manifold wisdom of God was shown in transforming many of these most diverse elements, unifying them, building them up into a great spiritual body, into a holy, most beautiful, most symmetrical temple. When all things seem to be flying asunder into the most diverse and antagonistic elements, God gives a new turn, as it were, to providence, and lo! a glorious symmetrical and harmonious structure begins to rise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ His purpose was ] that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
