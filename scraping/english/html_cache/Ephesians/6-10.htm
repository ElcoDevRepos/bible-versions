Paul is wrapping up his letter to the Ephesians, which has addressed various aspects of Christian living, including unity, spiritual gifts, and relationships. The use of "finally" suggests that what follows is of utmost importance, serving as a capstone to the teachings provided earlier in the letter.<p><b>be strong in the Lord</b><br>The strength mentioned here is not of human origin but is found in a relationship with the Lord. This phrase emphasizes reliance on God's power rather than one's own abilities. The concept of being "in the Lord" is central to Pauline theology, highlighting the believer's union with Christ. This strength is necessary for spiritual warfare, as outlined in the subsequent verses. The idea of divine strength is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where Paul states, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."<p><b>and in His mighty power</b><br>This phrase underscores the source of the believer's strength: God's mighty power. The Greek word for "power" here is "kratos," which often refers to God's sovereign and overwhelming strength. This power is the same that raised Christ from the dead (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>), indicating its immense capability. The reference to God's power also connects to Old Testament themes, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, where God's mighty hand was evident. Believers are called to tap into this divine power to stand firm against spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture, and the location of a significant early Christian community to whom Paul addressed this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, this early Christian community faced challenges from both pagan influences and internal doctrinal issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Jesus Christ)</a></b><br>Central to the verse, the Lord is the source of strength and power for believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6</a> discusses the spiritual battle believers face, emphasizing the need for divine strength.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_divine_strength.htm">Dependence on Divine Strength</a></b><br>Believers are called to rely not on their own abilities but on the strength that comes from the Lord.

Now, at the close, he signals, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the capstone.&#8221;<p>- Similar &#8220;finally&#8221; moments appear in <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, showing a pattern: when the Holy Spirit says &#8220;finally,&#8221; what follows deserves full attention.<p>- In everyday terms, this is the moment you lean forward, because everything just taught is meant to flow into the command that follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be strong</b><p>- The phrase is an imperative, not a suggestion. God calls His people to strength, the same way He told Joshua, &#8220;Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>- Our culture often views strength as self-generated. Scripture flips that notion. The command implies we can obey because God provides what He commands (<a href="/psalms/28-7.htm">Psalm 28:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>- Strength here involves:<p>&#8226; Steadfast faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>)<p>&#8226; Moral courage (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>)<p>&#8226; Resilience under spiritual attack (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11&#8211;12</a>)<p>- This strength is for every believer, not a select few. &#8220;Little children, you are strong, and the word of God abides in you&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-14.htm">1 John 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the Lord</b><p>- Location matters. The strength is found &#8220;in the Lord,&#8221; not in personality, intellect, or willpower. Union with Christ is the source (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- Paul has used this phrase repeatedly: believers are blessed &#8220;in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>), created for good works &#8220;in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>), and now empowered &#8220;in the Lord.&#8221;<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Stay anchored in Scripture where Christ&#8217;s voice is clear (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Cultivate conscious dependence through prayer, echoing &#8220;Apart from You I can do nothing&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Participate in the body of Christ; strength is multiplied in community (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in His mighty power</b><p>- The power is God&#8217;s, not ours. The same power &#8220;that He exerted when He raised Christ from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19&#8211;20</a>) now energizes believers.<p>- Old Testament echoes: God&#8217;s &#8220;mighty hand&#8221; delivered Israel (<a href="/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a>). New Testament fulfillment: that same might secures victory over sin, death, and the devil (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<p>- When life feels overwhelming:<p>&#8226; Remember <a href="/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1&#8211;2</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD is my strength.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Rely on <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>&#8212;His power is perfected in weakness.<p>&#8226; Rejoice that &#8220;greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a> is a rally cry. Because every word of God is true, we can obey it with confidence. Paul concludes the letter by urging believers to draw their courage, endurance, and victory not from self, but from the inexhaustible strength found in the risen Christ. Remaining &#8220;in the Lord&#8221; secures access to His &#8220;mighty power,&#8221; enabling us to stand firm in every spiritual battle and live out the full gospel life God intends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6. <span class= "bld">Conclusion</span> (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10-24</a>).<p>(1) FINAL EXHORTATION to put on the whole armour of God, in order to stand fast in the struggle, not against flesh and blood, but against unearthly powers of evil (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>).<p>(2) SPECIAL DESIRE OF THEIR PRAYERS, as for themselves and for all men, so especially for St. Paul himself (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18-20</a>).<p>(3) COMMENDATION OF TYCHICUS (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21-22</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-20.</span> - THE CHRISTIAN WARFARE. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Finally</span>. The apostle has now reached his last passage, and by this word quickens the attention of his readers and prepares them for a counsel eminently weighty in itself, and gathering up the pith and marrow, as it were, of what goes before. "My brethren," A.V., is rejected by R.V, and most modern commentators, for lack of external evidence. We note, however, that, whereas in the preceding verses he had distributed the Ephesians into groups, giving an appropriate counsel to each, he now brings them again together, and has a concluding counsel for them all. <span class="cmt_word">Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</span> Compare with <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>, where the heavenly provision for obtaining strength is specified, and with <a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>, where we are cautioned against a course that will fritter away that provision. The ever-recurring formula, "in the Lord," indicates the relation to Christ in which alone the strength can be experienced (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). The might is Christ's, but by faith it becomes our strength. As the steam-engine genders the dynamic force, which belts and wheels communicate to the inert machinery of the factory, so Christ is the source of that spiritual strength which through faith is communicated to all his people. To be strong is our duty; to be weak is our sin. Strong trust, strong courage, strong endurance, strong hope. strong love, may all be had from him, if only our fellowship with him be maintained in uninterrupted vigor. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(loipou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3064.htm">Strong's 3064: </a> </span><span class="str2">From now on, henceforth, finally.
