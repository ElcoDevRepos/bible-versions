In the biblical context, shame is often associated with the awareness of sin and the conviction of wrongdoing. The loss of shame suggests a seared conscience, as described in <a href="/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>, where individuals become desensitized to sin. This condition reflects the state of the Gentiles in Ephesus, who were immersed in pagan practices and idolatry, leading to a hardened heart (<a href="/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>). The cultural context of Ephesus, a city known for its temple to Artemis and associated immoral practices, provides a backdrop for understanding this moral decay.<p><b>they have given themselves over to sensuality</b><br>The act of giving oneself over implies a deliberate choice to pursue a lifestyle contrary to God's standards. Sensuality, in this context, refers to unrestrained indulgence in physical pleasures, often linked to sexual immorality. This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, where sensuality is listed among the works of the flesh. The historical context of Ephesus, with its rampant sexual immorality and temple prostitution, highlights the challenge early Christians faced in maintaining purity.<p><b>for the practice of every kind of impurity</b><br>This phrase underscores the extent of moral corruption, encompassing various forms of impurity. In biblical terms, impurity often relates to sexual sins but can also include other moral and ethical violations. <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-32</a> provides a parallel description of humanity's descent into impurity when they reject God. The use of "every kind" suggests a comprehensive abandonment to sin, reflecting the pervasive influence of pagan culture in Ephesus.<p><b>with a craving for more</b><br>The insatiable desire for more impurity indicates a deep spiritual void. This craving is reminiscent of the addictive nature of sin, where satisfaction is never truly attained, leading to a continual pursuit of greater depravity. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> describes how desire, when conceived, gives birth to sin, and sin, when fully grown, brings forth death. This cycle of sin and craving highlights the need for redemption and transformation through Christ, who offers true fulfillment and freedom from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to instruct and encourage them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis.

They are (he says) "past feeling"; or, literally, carrying on the metaphor of callousness, <span class= "ital">they have lost the capacity of pain</span>--the moral pain which is the natural and healthful consequence of sin against our true natures. Consequently, losing in this their true humanity, they give themselves over to "lasciviousness." The word used here (as also in <a href="/mark/7-22.htm" title="Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:">Mark 7:22</a>; <a href="/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2Corinthians 12:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>) signifies a lust devoid of all sense of decency, recklessly and grossly animal. Hence its result is not only to work out uncleanness of every kind, but to do so "with greediness," with a reckless delight in foulness for its own sake. The union of this brutality of sensual sin with intellectual acuteness and aesthetic culture was the most horrible feature of that corrupt Greek civilisation, tainted with Oriental grossness, of which he was especially writing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who being past feeling.</span> Without sense of shame, without conscience, without fear of God or regard for man, without any perception of the dignity of human nature, the glory of the Divine image, or the degradation of sin. <span class="cmt_word">Have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness</span> (fourth point of difference).
