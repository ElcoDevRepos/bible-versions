His coming fulfilled Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, which speak of the good news of peace. The term "preached" indicates the active proclamation of the Gospel, emphasizing that Jesus Himself was the messenger of reconciliation between God and humanity. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict but a profound spiritual peace that reconciles sinners to God (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><b>to you who were far away</b><br>This refers to the Gentiles, who were historically considered distant from the covenant promises given to Israel. <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a> describes them as "excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise." The phrase underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel, breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>). The "far away" also echoes <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, which speaks of peace to those far and near, indicating God's intention to extend His grace beyond the boundaries of Israel.<p><b>and peace to those who were near</b><br>This phrase pertains to the Jewish people, who were "near" because they had the covenants, the law, and the prophets (<a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4-5</a>). Despite their proximity to God's promises, they too needed the peace that comes through Christ, as the law could not bring about true reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>). The message of peace to those "near" fulfills the promise of a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to write His law on their hearts.<br><br>In summary, this verse encapsulates the universal scope of Christ's redemptive work, bridging the gap between Jew and Gentile, and offering peace to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who is the bringer of peace.

They represent those who were distant from God's chosen people and His promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews.htm">Jews ("those who were near")</a></b><br>The Jewish people who were historically closer to God due to the covenants, the Law, and the prophets.

By His coming, preaching, and cross, He erased the gap between Gentile and Jew, ushering all believers into one redeemed family with genuine, lasting peace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And came and preached peace.</span>--The word "came" certainly carries back our thoughts to our Lord's own preaching, when, after the Resurrection, He came "and stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be unto you" (<a href="/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36</a>; <a href="/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>; <a href="/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>). But we note that at that very time He repeated the salutation "Peace be unto you," with the expressive addition, "As my Father hath sent Me, even so send I you," and with the charge, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost," for the future mission "to remit or retain sins." In the same connection we have in <a href="/context/john/14-25.htm" title="These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.">John 14:25-28</a>, the promise of the Comforter, and the words "Peace I leave with you; My peace I give unto you. . . . I go away and come again to you." Hence we cannot limit His "coming" to the appearance after the Resurrection. At all times through the witness of the Holy Spirit, whether with or without the preaching of His servants (<a href="/john/15-27.htm" title="And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.">John 15:27</a>), He "stands at the door and knocks" (<a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>) with the message of peace. For since the "peacemakers" are "called the children of God," He, the Son of God, must be emphatically the Peacemaker. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having come, he preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to these that were nigh.</span> The coming denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> is subsequent to the transactions of the cross. It cannot denote what Christ did personally, but what he did by sending his Spirit to the apostles and other early preachers. It was only after the cross and after the resurrection that peace could be proclaimed on the footing of faith in a Savior who had died and was alive. And only in the sense of having sent his preachers and given them his Spirit could Jesus be said to have preached to the Ephesians. The repetition of the word "peace" in the R.V. is expressive; if the subject had been merely peace between the two classes of men, we should not have had the repetition; the repetition denotes peace between each of the two classes and a third party, viz. God. It is remarkable that the Gentiles, "those that were far off," are mentioned here before the Jews, "those that were nigh." In point of chronology, the Jews came first; but the order is here transposed, probably to emphasize the offer of the gospel to the Gentiles, and to show that spiritually they were as near as the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] preached</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#951;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(eu&#275;ngelisato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2097.htm">Strong's 2097: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eu and aggelos; to announce good news especially the gospel.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">peace</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#961;&#942;&#957;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eir&#275;n&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1515.htm">Strong's 1515: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from a primary verb eiro; peace; by implication, prosperity.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
