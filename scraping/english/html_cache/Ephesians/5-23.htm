The concept of "head" implies leadership and responsibility rather than domination. In the cultural context of the first century, the husband was typically the provider and protector, roles that align with the biblical understanding of headship. This mirrors the order seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where Paul states that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God, indicating a divine order and purpose.<p><b>as Christ is the head of the church</b><br>Here, the relationship between husband and wife is compared to that of Christ and the church. Christ's headship over the church is characterized by love, sacrifice, and service, as seen in His earthly ministry and ultimate sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). This sets a standard for husbands to emulate in their leadership. The church, as the body of Christ, submits to His authority, which is exercised with love and for the church's benefit (<a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>).<p><b>His body</b><br>The church is often referred to as the body of Christ, emphasizing unity and diversity within the community of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This metaphor highlights the intimate and organic connection between Christ and the church, where Christ is the source of life and growth. The imagery of the body also suggests interdependence and the importance of each member functioning according to their God-given role.<p><b>of which He is the Savior</b><br>Christ's role as Savior underscores His sacrificial love and redemptive work on behalf of the church. This is a central theme in the New Testament, where Jesus' death and resurrection provide salvation and reconciliation with God (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-10</a>). The husband's role, therefore, is to reflect this self-giving love, prioritizing the well-being and spiritual growth of his wife, as Christ does for the church. This connection is further explored in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, where husbands are called to love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance and teaching to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesians.htm">Ephesians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a Christian community in Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>Represents the male partner in a marital relationship, given a role of leadership within the family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife.htm">Wife</a></b><br>Represents the female partner in a marital relationship, called to submit to her husband's leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>The head of the church, serving as the ultimate example of leadership and sacrificial love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_headship.htm">Understanding Headship</a></b><br>The concept of headship in marriage is not about dominance but about responsibility and sacrificial love, mirroring Christ's relationship with the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_husband.htm">Role of the Husband</a></b><br>Husbands are called to lead with love, humility, and selflessness, prioritizing the well-being of their wives and families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_wife.htm">Role of the Wife</a></b><br>Wives are encouraged to respect and support their husbands' leadership, fostering a partnership that reflects mutual love and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_model.htm">Christ as the Model</a></b><br>Christ's example of leadership is characterized by service and sacrifice, setting the standard for how husbands should lead their families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_marriage.htm">Unity in Marriage</a></b><br>The marital relationship should reflect the unity and love between Christ and the church, striving for harmony and mutual edification.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_5_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 5:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_5_23_on_husband_s_role.htm">How does Ephesians 5:23 define the husband's role in a Christian marriage?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Implication_of_Christ_as_church_head.htm">What does "Christ is the head of the church" imply for believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_husbands_lead_like_Christ.htm">How can husbands emulate Christ's leadership as described in Ephesians 5:23?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_headship_concept.htm">What other scriptures support the concept of headship in Ephesians 5:23?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Supporting_husbands_leadership_biblically.htm">How can wives support their husbands' leadership in light of Ephesians 5:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_husband_in_Ephesians_5_23.htm">How does Ephesians 5:23 define the role of a husband in a Christian marriage?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Christ_the_church_s_head.htm">Why is Christ compared to the head of the church in Ephesians 5:23?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_Ephesians_5_23_about_male_dominance.htm">Does Ephesians 5:23 imply male superiority in marriage?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_ecclesiasticism.htm">What defines the Global Church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/husband_and_wife_roles.htm">What are the roles of husband and wife?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_spiritual_covering.htm">What does the Bible say about spiritual covering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_the_global_church.htm">What defines the Global Church?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ephesians 5:23 Mean</div><b>For the husband is the head of the wife</b><p>&#8226; Scripture presents headship as God-given order, not personal superiority. First Corinthians 11:3 affirms, &#8220;the head of a woman is man,&#8221; while still placing every man under Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18, 24</a> shows the pattern from creation: the woman was fashioned as a &#8220;suitable helper,&#8221; and the two become &#8220;one flesh.&#8221; Headship therefore serves the unity of marriage, not domination.<p>&#8226; Healthy headship is protective and self-sacrificial. First Peter 3:7 tells husbands to live with their wives &#8220;in an understanding way&#8230; showing them honor.&#8221; Any form of harshness violates the very concept Paul is teaching.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as Christ is the head of the church</b><p>&#8226; The model for a husband&#8217;s leadership is Christ Himself. <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> says Jesus &#8220;is the head of the body, the church,&#8221; underscoring supreme yet loving authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a> portrays Christ&#8217;s headship as purposeful: God &#8220;put everything under His feet&#8221; for the church&#8217;s benefit. Likewise, a husband&#8217;s role seeks the wife&#8217;s good, not personal gain.<p>&#8226; Leadership patterned after Jesus is servant-hearted (<a href="/luke/22-26.htm">Luke 22:26-27</a>) and marked by self-giving love (<a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>). When a husband imitates this, his authority blesses, never burdens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His body</b><p>&#8226; Paul reminds us that Christ and the church are organically united. First Corinthians 12:12-13 explains that &#8220;we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Marriage mirrors that same oneness. <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>&#8217;s &#8220;one flesh&#8221; union means a husband cannot treat his wife as separate from himself; her well-being is his own (<a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The body image highlights mutual care. <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a> notes that every member belongs to the others. Headship, therefore, never negates the wife&#8217;s value or voice; it functions within deep, God-given unity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of which He is the Savior</b><p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s headship culminates in saving action: &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Only Jesus provides eternal salvation (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). A husband cannot redeem his wife spiritually, yet he reflects the Savior by laying down preferences, time, and even life itself for her flourishing.<p>&#8226; This saving motif guards against selfish leadership. Any authority that harms or exploits contradicts the gospel picture and invites God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/colossians/3-19.htm">Colossians 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a> teaches a divinely ordered partnership in which the husband exercises Christ-like headship&#8212;protective, sacrificial, and oriented toward his wife&#8217;s good&#8212;just as Jesus lovingly leads and rescues His church, His own body. Far from granting license to dominate, the verse calls husbands to embody the Savior&#8217;s servant leadership while upholding the essential unity and worth of husband and wife before God (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church.</span>--It is instructive to compare this with the partly similar passage in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>. There "the head of the woman is the man," as here; but "the head of every man (individually) is Christ," considered in His human nature; and finally, "the Head of Christ," as the Son of Man, "is God." There, accordingly, "headship" is simple lordship; the woman is subject to the man, the man is subject to Christ alone; Christ as the Son is subject to the Father. Here, on the other hand, we note, first, that in accordance with the general idea of the Epistle, the headship of Christ over the Church at large takes the place of His headship over the individual; next, that from the idea of His headship so conceived is derived the further idea of a spiritual unity, involving self-sacrifice in the head, as well as obedience to the head; and, lastly, that since the very idea of unity in Christ is unity with God, there is nothing to correspond to the third clause in the former Epistle.<p>(23, 24) <span class= "bld">And he is the saviour of the body. Therefore . . .</span>--The words "and" and "is" are wrongly inserted, and the word "therefore" is absolutely an error, evading the difficulty of the passage. It should be, <span class= "ital">He Himself being the Saviour of the Body. But</span> . . . This clause, in which the words "He Himself" are emphatic, notes (as if in order to guard against too literal acceptation of the comparison) that "Christ" (and He alone) is not only Head, but "Saviour of the Body," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"of His body the Church," not only teaching and ruling it, but by His unity infusing into it the new life of justification and sanctification. Here no husband can be like Him, and therefore none can claim the absolute dependence of faith which is His of right. Accordingly St. Paul adds the word "But." Though "this is so," yet "still let the wives," &c.<p><span class= "bld">As the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</span>--The subjection of the Church of Christ is a free subjection, arising out of faith in His absolute wisdom and goodness, and of love for His unspeakable love. Hence we gather (1) that the subordination of the wife is not that of the slave, by. compulsion and fear, but one which arises from and preserves freedom; next (2), that it can exist, or at any rate can endure, only on condition of superior wisdom and goodness and love in the husband; thirdly (3), that while it is like the higher subordination in kind, it cannot be equally perfect in degree--while it is real "in everything," it can be absolute in nothing. The antitype is, as usual, greater than the type.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the Head of the Church.</span> The woman was made for the man (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-13.htm">1 Timothy 2:13</a>), showing the Divine purpose that the man should be the head and center of the household, and that the position of the wife, as wife, should be one of subordination. Parallel to this arrangement is the relation of Christ to the Church. In words, at least, all admit the headship of Christ, and the subordination of the Church to him. The Christian household, on a much lower level, should exemplify the same relation. <span class="cmt_word">Being himself savior of the body.</span> This is not said by way of contrast, but still by way of parallel. The very saviorship of Christ should find an analogy in the Christian husband. The husband should be the ever-vigilant and self-denying protector, guardian, deliverer, of his family, though his saving power can never come near the high level of Christ's A husband reckless of these obligations virtually ceases to have any claim on the subjection of the wife and the family. The very comparison of the husband to the Savior implies that, while there is a certain analogy, there is a still greater contrast. This is implied in the first word of the following verse. Between the lines we read this thought: "Not that the parallel between Christ's saving function and the husband's extends to the highest things." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] husband</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#942;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(an&#275;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_435.htm">Strong's 435: </a> </span><span class="str2">A male human being; a man, husband.
