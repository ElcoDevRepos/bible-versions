It implies that the love husbands are to show is modeled after Christ's sacrificial love. This sets a high standard, emphasizing selflessness and devotion.<p><b>husbands ought to love their wives</b><br>The directive is clear and imperative. In the Greco-Roman world, marriage was often more about social contracts than love. This command elevates the marital relationship to one of mutual care and affection, reflecting the divine relationship between Christ and the church. It challenges cultural norms by placing love at the center of the marital bond.<p><b>as their own bodies.</b><br>This analogy underscores the unity and oneness in marriage, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where husband and wife become "one flesh." It suggests a deep, intrinsic connection, where caring for one's spouse is as natural and necessary as caring for oneself. This reflects the biblical principle of unity and mutual respect within marriage.<p><b>He who loves his wife loves himself.</b><br>This statement reinforces the idea of unity in marriage. It implies that in loving one's wife, a husband is ultimately benefiting himself, as they are one flesh. This reflects the biblical teaching that marriage is a partnership where both individuals are interdependent. It also aligns with the broader scriptural theme of selfless love, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>, where believers are encouraged to consider others' interests as their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

"So" refers to the previous verse, describing the love of Christ, not to the "as" following; otherwise the want of connection would be strangely abrupt. Moreover, from this idea of the love of Christ as the pattern, the latter part of this verse and the following verses naturally arise. Christ loves the Church as His body, a part of Himself. Hence the idea that the husband is "the head of the wife" gives place to the absolute identification of himself with his wife, as "one flesh."<p><span class= "bld">He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</span>--All right "love of our neighbour" is directed to be given to him "as to ourselves." It is to be of the same kind as the love of self--that is, first, an instinct (as of self-preservation); and next a rational and settled principle (as of reasonable self-love, seeking our own perfection, which is our happiness). Here, however, this love to our neighbour is actually identified with self-love. The wife is the husband's very self; he can no more fail to love her than to love himself, though (again to follow the example of Christ) he may love her better than himself. We may note that this identification of husband and wife is the basis of all ecclesiastical, and, in great degree, of all civil, law of Christian nations as to marriage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies.</span> A new illustration is introduced here to throw light on the bearing of the husband to his wife, and the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> seems to refer, not to what goes before, but to what follows (comp. in ver. 33). <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth his own wife loveth himself.</span> His wife is part of himself, so that not to love her as himself is not only a sin against law, but a sin against nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the same way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hout&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3779.htm">Strong's 3779: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thus, so, in this manner.
