The early church, composed of Jews and Gentiles, faced challenges in achieving this unity due to cultural and religious differences. The call for unity is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>). Unity in faith implies a shared belief in the core tenets of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ and salvation through grace. This unity is not just organizational but spiritual, reflecting the oneness of the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>).<p><b>and in the knowledge of the Son of God</b><br>Knowledge here refers to an intimate, experiential understanding of Jesus Christ, not merely intellectual assent. This knowledge is transformative, leading to spiritual growth and maturity. The phrase underscores the importance of knowing Christ personally, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>, where Paul expresses his desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection. This knowledge is foundational for believers, as it shapes their identity and purpose in Christ.<p><b>as we mature</b><br>Maturity in the Christian context involves growing in spiritual wisdom and character, reflecting the fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). The process of maturing is ongoing, requiring believers to be rooted in Scripture and active in their faith. <a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a> contrasts spiritual infancy with maturity, urging believers to progress beyond elementary teachings. Maturity is marked by discernment, stability in faith, and the ability to teach and encourage others.<p><b>to the full measure of the stature of Christ</b><br>This phrase sets the standard for Christian maturity as the likeness of Christ Himself. Believers are called to grow into His image, reflecting His character and love. The "full measure" suggests completeness and perfection, a process that will be fully realized in eternity (1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). The stature of Christ represents His moral and spiritual excellence, which believers are to emulate. This transformation is a work of the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>, where believers are being transformed into the image of Christ from glory to glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage unity and maturity in faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse population and the Temple of Artemis.

The Spirit directs our focus away from individual achievement toward a shared, Christ-centered destiny (cf. <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Until we all reach&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;until&#8221; keeps us looking ahead; growth is ongoing.<p>&#8226; &#8220;We all&#8221; emphasizes that no believer is exempt&#8212;growth is corporate as well as personal (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase guards us from complacency; God is &#8220;faithful to complete the good work&#8221; He began (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>) and will keep shaping us &#8220;spirit, soul, and body&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Unity in the faith&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This unity is not uniformity but shared trust in Christ&#8217;s finished work (<a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus prayed &#8220;that they may be one&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21</a>); Paul urges &#8220;be perfectly united in mind and conviction&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>).<p>&#8226; When the church prizes the gospel above secondary issues, the world sees the reality of Christ&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And in the knowledge of the Son of God&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The goal is relational knowledge&#8212;knowing a Person, not merely facts (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; As we &#8220;grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>), idols lose their grip (<a href="/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; This knowledge deepens through Scripture (<a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>), obedience (<a href="/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21</a>), and fellowship with other believers (<a href="/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;As we mature&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Spiritual adulthood replaces spiritual infancy (<a href="/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul &#8220;proclaims Christ, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Marks of maturity include discernment (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>), steadfast love (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11&#8211;13</a>), and fruitfulness (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;To the full measure of the stature of Christ&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s ultimate design is Christ-likeness: &#8220;those He foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>).<p>&#8226; This &#8220;measure&#8221; is not partial but complete; we are being &#8220;transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, it shows in walking &#8220;as He walked&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>) and putting on the &#8220;new self&#8221; that is &#8220;renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a> charts the destination of every Spirit-led journey: a united, mature body marked by shared faith, intimate knowledge of Christ, and a growing resemblance to Him.

Such faith always goes on to knowledge, that is (as in <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>) "full knowledge" of Him in whom we have believed. So in <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2Peter 1:17</a>, "Add to your faith virtue" (that is, energy in well-doing), "and to virtue knowledge." This knowledge (see <a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>) is gained mainly through the love in which faith is made perfect.<p><span class= "bld">Of the Son of God.</span>--These words should be connected with the word "faith" (as in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>) as well as "knowledge." They are probably to be considered as a distinctive phrase, designating our Lord especially as glorified and exalted to the right hand of the Father in "the glory which he had with the Father before the world was." So in <a href="/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>, He is "declared to be the Son of God by the Resurrection;" and in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14</a>, "Jesus the Son of God" is "the High Priest ascended into the heavens." Compare also our Lord's declaration that "if any man speaks against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him" (<a href="/matthew/12-32.htm" title="And whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.">Matthew 12:32</a>) with the declaration of the certain vengeance on him who "treads under foot the Son of God" (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). Note again, in St. John's First Epistle, the constant reference to the belief in and confession of Jesus as "the Son of God" as the one thing needful (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/5-10.htm" title="Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:10-12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-20.htm" title="Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;">Ephesians 5:20</a>). For on the belief not only of what He was on earth, but of what He is in heaven, all distinctive Christianity depends. If He is only "Son of Man" He cannot be the universal Saviour. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until we all come.</span> This marks the duration of the office of the ministry. Some maintain that it implies that <span class="accented">all</span> these offices are to continue in the Church until the result specified is obtained (Catholic Apostolic or Irvingite Church): this is contradicted by Scripture and by experience, so far as apostles and prophets are concerned, for the gifts for these offices were not continued, and without the gifts the offices are impossible. The meaning is that, till the event specified, there is to be a provision in the Church of the offices that are needed, and the apostle, in using "until," probably had in view the last office in his list - pastors and teachers. <span class="cmt_word">To the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</span> Both genitives are governed by unity; already there is one faith (ver. 5), but we all, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. all who compose or are yet to compose the body of Christ, the totality of this body, have to be brought to this faith. As in ver. 5 "faith" is not equivalent to "creed," or truth believed, but the act of believing; so here the consummation which the ministers of the Church are given to bring about is a state in which faith in the Son of God shall characterize all, and that, not a blind faith, but a faith associated with knowledge. Usually faith and knowledge are opposed to each other; but here faith has more the meaning of trust than of mere belief - trust based on knowledge, trust in the Son of God based on knowledge of his Person, his work, and his relation to them that receive him. To bring all the elect to this faith is the object of the ministry; when they are all brought to it, the body of Christ will be complete, and the functions of the Christian ministry will cease. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</span> The idea of organic completeness is more fully expressed by these two clauses; the consummation is the completeness of the whole body of Christ as <span class="accented">such</span>; but that involves the maturity of each individual who is a constituent part of that body; and the measure or sign of maturity, both for the individual and for the whole, is the stature of the fullness of Christ (comp. <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "<span class="accented">Whom</span> he did foreknow, them he also foredained to be <span class="accented">conformed to the image of his Son"</span>). The question has been put - Will this consummation be in this life or the next? The one seems to melt into the other; the idea of a complete Church and that of a new economy seem inseparable; as the coming of Christ will terminate the observance of the Lord's Supper, so it will terminate the ministries ordained by Christ for the completion of his Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#941;&#967;&#961;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(mechri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3360.htm">Strong's 3360: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, until, even to. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">we all reach</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#969;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katant&#275;s&#333;men)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2658.htm">Strong's 2658: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and a derivative of anti; to meet against, i.e. Arrive at.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">unity</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(henot&#275;ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1775.htm">Strong's 1775: </a> </span><span class="str2">Oneness, unity, unanimity.
