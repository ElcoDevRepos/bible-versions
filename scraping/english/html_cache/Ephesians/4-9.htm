The ascension signifies Christ's exaltation and His return to the Father after completing His earthly ministry. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>, which speaks of God ascending on high. The ascension is a key event in Christian theology, marking the transition from Christ's earthly work to His heavenly intercession.<p><b>except that He also descended</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the necessity of Christ's descent before His ascension. The descent is often interpreted as His incarnation, where He came down from heaven to live as a man on earth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). Some interpretations also consider this descent as His going to the realm of the dead, as suggested in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>, where Christ is said to have preached to the spirits in prison. This descent emphasizes His humility and willingness to fully engage with the human condition.<p><b>to the lower parts of the earth?</b><br>This phrase can be understood in several ways. Traditionally, it has been seen as a reference to Christ's burial and His presence in the grave, aligning with the Apostles' Creed's mention of His descent into hell. It can also be interpreted as His coming to earth from heaven, emphasizing the depth of His condescension. The "lower parts of the earth" may also symbolize the realm of the dead, where Christ proclaimed victory over sin and death. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and Christ's ultimate triumph over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is the one who "ascended" and "descended."

He went low to save, rose high to reign, and now fills all things with His presence and power. His journey down and up becomes both the foundation of our salvation and the model for our humble, hope-filled service today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9, 10) These verses form a parenthesis, designed to bring out the pervading idea of this and the parallel Epistle--the Divine humanity of Christ as "filling all in all" and "gathering all things" into Himself.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">The lower parts of the earth.</span>--This may mean either <span class= "ital">the regions of the earth, </span>as "lower" than heaven, or the <span class= "ital">regions beneath the earth.</span> The reasoning of the text in itself would be satisfied by the former. For St. Paul is simply arguing that the use of the phrase "ascended" from earth to heaven implies a previous corresponding descent, which must be from heaven to earth; exactly as in <a href="/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>, "No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that came down from heaven." But form and usage of the phrase itself seem to point to the other meaning, which is held by almost all ancient interpreters and most moderns. It agrees with the strong expression of "filling all things," in <a href="/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>, and is possibly suggested by the leading captive of the powers of hell and death. Though, perhaps, injurious to the strictness of the antithesis, it is quite accordant with St. Paul's manner to introduce thus a fresh idea beyond the simple idea of descent, which is sufficient for his argument: "He descended--yea, even to the realms below." For this idea is most apposite to that frequent reference to spiritual powers of evil found in this Epistle, and it may be thought to correspond by antithesis to the "far above all heavens" of the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now (the fact) that he ascended, what does it imply but that he descended first?</span> The ascent implied a previous descent; that is, the ascent of the Son of God - of one <span class="accented">who was himself in heaven</span>, who was in the bosom of the Father (comp. <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), implied that he had come down from heaven, a striking proof of his interest in and love for the children of men. And the descent was net merely to the ordinary condition of humanity, but to a more than ordinarily degraded condition, not merely to the surface of the earth, but <span class="cmt_word">to the lower parts of the earth.</span> This has sometimes been interpreted of Hades, but surely without reason. If the expression denotes more than Christ's humble condition, it probably means the <span class="accented">grave</span>. This was the climax of Christ's humiliation; to be removed out of men's sight, as too offensive for them to look on - to be hidden away in the depths of the earth, in the grave, was indeed supremely humbling. The object is to show that, in bestowing gifts on men, Christ did not merely bring into play his inherent bountifulness as the Son of God, but acted as Mediator, by right of special purchase, through his work of humiliation on earth; and thus to lead us to think the more highly both of the Giver and of his gifts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
