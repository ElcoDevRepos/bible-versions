In the context of <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>, it speaks to Christ's work in the church, His bride. Sanctification is a key theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the transformation and purification of believers. In the Old Testament, sanctification involved rituals and sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/29-43.htm">Exodus 29:43-44</a>), but in the New Testament, it is primarily a spiritual process accomplished through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). This sanctification is both a positional reality, as believers are declared holy through faith in Christ, and a progressive process, as they grow in holiness through the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-4</a>).<p><b>cleansing her</b><br>The cleansing mentioned here is symbolic of spiritual purification. In the ancient world, cleansing rituals were common in both Jewish and pagan practices, often involving water as a symbol of purification. In the New Testament, cleansing is closely associated with forgiveness of sins and moral purity (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). This cleansing is made possible through the blood of Christ, which washes away sin (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>). The imagery of cleansing also connects to the idea of the church as the bride of Christ, who is made pure and spotless for her union with Him (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>).<p><b>by the washing with water</b><br>This phrase evokes the imagery of baptism, a rite of initiation and purification in the Christian faith. Baptism symbolizes the believer's identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-4</a>). It represents the washing away of sins and the beginning of a new life in Christ (<a href="/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>). The use of water in this context highlights the cleansing and renewing work of the Holy Spirit, who regenerates and renews believers (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). The washing with water is not merely a physical act but signifies an inward spiritual transformation.<p><b>through the word</b><br>The "word" here refers to the message of the Gospel and the Scriptures as a whole. The Word of God is living and active, capable of transforming hearts and minds (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). It is through the Word that believers are taught, rebuked, corrected, and trained in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>). The Word acts as a cleansing agent, purifying the believer's heart and mind (<a href="/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>). In the context of <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>, the Word is instrumental in the sanctification process, as it reveals God's will and empowers believers to live holy lives.

Hence we must conclude that the phrase "in the Word" is in some way connected with that sacrament. Of the two Greek words translated "word," the one here used is that which signifies not "the word" existing as a definite thought in the mind, but "the word" as audibly spoken. It has, indeed, in the original no article, but this is probably because it had assumed so technical a sense as to resemble a proper name; and it is best connected with the phrase "having cleansed it," thus being coordinated, not subordinated, to the "laver of the water." Accordingly it would seem to signify all that element of baptism which is "in word"--that is, the question of faith, "the answer of a good conscience" (<a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>), and, lastly, the solemn formula of baptism "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." If we are to single out any of these, we must surely (with Chrysostom) take the last. But it is better to embrace the whole, and so include the whole spiritual element of baptism, both the acceptance of faith on the part of man, and the grace-giving blessing of God.<p>To "sanctify" is here to consecrate to Himself (comp. <a href="/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>; <a href="/john/17-19.htm" title="And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.">John 17:19</a>) after purification. In the same connection we have in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1Corinthians 6:11</a>, "Ye were washed, ye were sanctified, ye were justified." In virtue of such consecration the Church visible is "holy" in idea and in capacity--the Church invisible here (which will be the Church triumphant hereafter), holy in the actual purity which becomes a consecrated nature. Of such consecration baptism is unquestionably the means; as we see in command in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, and in fact in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the Word.</span> The immediate object of Christ was to cleanse her, and for this end he used the Word as a purifying agent, washing her by means of it. The difference between selfish and unselfish love is seen here: a selfish lover cares for his wife in his own interest - like Samson, desires to have her simply because she pleases him, and, in his converse with her, thinks, not of her good, but of his own enjoyment; but the love of an unselfish lover constrains him to seek her good, to do nothing that will hurt her and damage her in any manner of way, but to do everything that he believes will advance her well-being, especially in the highest sense. He finds her polluted (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>.), and his great instrument of cleansing is "the Word" (comp. <a href="/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>; <a href="/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>) - the Word in all its searching, humbling, rebuking, correcting, informing, stimulating, refreshing, consoling power.
