In the context of Ephesians, Paul addresses the division between Jews and Gentiles. Christ's role as "our peace" signifies the reconciliation He provides, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, which refers to the Messiah as the "Prince of Peace." This peace is not just the absence of conflict but a holistic restoration of relationships with God and among people.<p><b>who has made the two one</b><br>Here, "the two" refers to Jews and Gentiles. Historically, Jews were God's chosen people, and Gentiles were often seen as outsiders. Through Christ's sacrifice, these two groups are united into one body, the Church. This unity is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). Theologically, this reflects the breaking down of ethnic and cultural barriers, creating a new humanity in Christ.<p><b>and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility</b><br>The "dividing wall" can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it may refer to the wall in the Jerusalem Temple that separated the Court of the Gentiles from the inner courts, symbolizing exclusion. Metaphorically, it represents the Law of Moses, which distinguished Jews from Gentiles. Christ's death abolished the ceremonial laws that separated these groups, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ canceling the "written code." This act of tearing down the wall signifies the end of enmity and the beginning of unity in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to this verse, Jesus is described as "our peace," emphasizing His role in reconciling both Jews and Gentiles to God and to each other.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jews_and_gentiles.htm">Jews and Gentiles</a></b><br>The two groups historically separated by cultural, religious, and social barriers.

Here, however, only is our Lord called not the giver of peace, but the peace itself--His own nature being the actual tie of unity between God and mankind, and between man and man. Through the whole passage thus introduced there runs a double meaning, a declaration of peace in Christ between Jew and Gentile, and between both and God; though it is not always easy to tell of any particular expression, whether it belongs to this or that branch of the meaning, or to both. It is well to compare it with the obvious parallel in <a href="/context/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13-14</a>, where (in accordance with the whole genius of that Epistle) there is found only the latter branch of the meaning, the union of all with the Head, not the unity of the various members of the Body.<p><span class= "bld">Who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us.</span>--In this verse the former subject is begun. The reunion of Jew and Gentile is described in close connection with the breaking down of "the middle wall of the partition" (or, <span class= "ital">hedge</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The words "between us" are not in the original, and Chrysostom interprets the partition as being, not between Jew and Gentile, but between both and God. But the former idea seems at any rate to predominate in this clause. Whether "the middle wall of the hedge" refers to the wall separating the court of the Gentiles from the Temple proper (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xv.</span> ? 5), and by an inscription denouncing death to any alien who passed it (see Lewin's <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>vol. ii., p. 133), or to the "hedge" set about the vineyard of the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm" title="And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the middle of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.">Isaiah 5:2</a>; comp. <a href="/matthew/22-33.htm" title="And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.">Matthew 22:33</a>)--to which probably the Jewish doctors alluded when they called their ceremonial and legal subtleties "the hedge" of the Law--has been disputed. It may, however, be noted that the charge of bringing Trophimus, an Ephesian, beyond that Temple wall had been the cause of St. Paul's apprehension at Jerusalem (<a href="/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>), and nearly of his death. Hence the Asiatic churches might well be familiar with its existence. It is also notable that this Temple-partition suits perfectly the double sense of this passage: for, while it was primarily a separation between Jew and Gentile, it was also the first of many partitions--of which the "veil of the Temple" was the last--cutting all men off from the immediate presence of God. At our Lord's death the last of these partitions was rent in twain; how much more may that death be described as breaking down the first! . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he is our peace.</span> Explanatory of the preceding verse - of the way by which we are brought nigh. Christ is not only our Peacemaker, but our Peace, and that in the fullest sense, the very substance and living spring of it, establishing it at the beginning, keeping it up to the end; and the complex notion of peace is here not only peace between Jew and Gentile, but between God and both. Consult Old Testament predictions of peace in connection with Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5, 6</a>; <a href="/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>; <a href="/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Who made both one</span>; literally, <span class="accented">both things</span>, <span class="accented">both elements</span>; so that there is now no ground for separating between a Jewish element and a Gentile; they are unified. <span class="cmt_word">And broke down the middle wall of the partition.</span> The general idea is obvious; the particular allusion is less easily seen. Some think it is to the veil that separated the holy of holies from the holy place (<a href="/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>); but that could hardly be called a <span class="accented">wall</span>. Others the wall that separated the court of the Jew from that of the Gentiles; but that wall was literally standing when the apostle wrote, and besides, the Ephesians could not be supposed to be so familiar with it as to make it a suitable illustration for them. In the absence of any specific allusion, it is best to understand the words generally, "broke down that which served as a middle wall of partition" - what is mentioned immediately in the following verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#940;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
