The concept of grace is central to Christian theology, highlighting God's unmerited favor towards humanity. In the biblical context, grace is often associated with salvation and the work of Christ. The glory of this grace is its divine origin and its transformative power in the lives of believers. This echoes themes found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a> and <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>, where grace is portrayed as a gift that leads to redemption and sanctification. The phrase underscores the idea that God's grace is not only a means of salvation but also a reason for worship and adoration.<p><b>which He has freely given us</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the generosity and liberality of God's grace. The term "freely given" suggests that this grace is not earned or deserved but is a gift from God. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that salvation is a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where it is stated that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works. The historical context of the early church, which was grappling with the transition from the Law to grace, underscores the radical nature of this gift. It was a departure from the works-based righteousness of the Old Covenant to the grace-based righteousness of the New Covenant.<p><b>in the Beloved One</b><br>The "Beloved One" refers to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His unique relationship with the Father and His role in the plan of salvation. This title reflects the deep love and approval of the Father for the Son, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God declares Jesus as His beloved Son. Theologically, this phrase points to the union of believers with Christ, as they are recipients of grace through their connection with Him. This union is a central theme in Pauline theology, where believers are described as being "in Christ," signifying their participation in His death, resurrection, and inheritance. The use of "Beloved" also connects to Old Testament prophecies and typologies, such as the beloved son Isaac, who prefigures Christ's sacrificial role.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Ephesians, addressing the church in Ephesus and emphasizing the spiritual blessings in Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesians.htm">Ephesians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a group of believers in the city of Ephesus, known for its significant role in early Christianity and its challenges with pagan practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The source of the glorious grace mentioned in the verse, who has bestowed this grace upon believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ (the Beloved One)</a></b><br>Referred to as "the Beloved One," through whom God's grace is given to believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/grace.htm">Grace</a></b><br>The unmerited favor and love of God, which is a central theme in Paul's writings and is highlighted as a reason for praise.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_grace.htm">Understanding Grace</a></b><br>Recognize that grace is a gift from God, not earned by works, and it is given freely through Jesus Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_praise.htm">Living in Praise</a></b><br>Our response to God's grace should be a life of praise and gratitude, acknowledging His generosity and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Embrace your identity as one who is beloved by God, understanding that this status is secured through Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_grace.htm">Reflecting Grace</a></b><br>As recipients of grace, we are called to extend grace to others, reflecting God's love in our interactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/security_in_salvation.htm">Security in Salvation</a></b><br>Find assurance in the fact that God's grace is given freely and abundantly, securing our place in His family.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_1_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_honor_His_glorious_grace.htm">How can we live to the "praise of His glorious grace" daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_freely_given_in_Beloved.htm">What does being "freely given in the Beloved" mean for our identity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ephesians_1_6_to_John_1_16_grace.htm">How does Ephesians 1:6 connect to God's grace in John 1:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_God_s_grace_in_relationships.htm">In what ways can we reflect God's grace in our relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_grace_on_worship_prayer.htm">How does understanding God's grace impact our worship and prayer life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_praise_of_His_glorious_grace.htm">What does "to the praise of His glorious grace" mean in Ephesians 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_is_God_s_grace_in_Ephesians_1_6.htm">How does Ephesians 1:6 define God's grace in Christian theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_accepted_in_the_Beloved_key.htm">Why is being "accepted in the Beloved" significant in Ephesians 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_we_explain_changes_in_god's_plans.htm">Psalm 33:11 speaks of the Lord&#8217;s plans standing forever; how do we explain apparent historical changes in God&#8217;s dealings with humanity?

So in <a href="/context/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18-19</a>, to the request, "Show me Thy glory," the answer is, "I will make my <span class= "ital">goodness</span> to pass before thee . . . and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious." (Comp. <a href="/context/exodus/34-5.htm" title="And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.">Exodus 34:5-7</a>.) He is pleased to consider His glory best realised in the spectacle of souls redeemed and regenerate by His grace, and to decree that it should be thus realised for our sakes. "Wherefore would He have us praise and glorify Him? It is that our love to Him may be kindled more fervently. He desires not our service, nor our praise, nor anything else except our salvation" (Chrysostom's <span class= "ital">First Homily</span> on the Ephesians).<p><span class= "bld">Wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</span>--The verb here rendered "made us accepted," is the same verb used in <a href="/luke/1-28.htm" title="And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, you that are highly favored, the Lord is with you: blessed are you among women.">Luke 1:28</a> (and nowhere else in the New Testament), where we translate "highly favoured." Etymologically it means to "bestow grace upon;" the tense here is the past tense, not the perfect Hence the meaning is (in connection with the previous clause), "His grace, which He bestowed upon us in the Beloved"--in virtue of our unity with "His beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased" (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>). This special title is given to our Lord to mark a connection with the "love" declared in the last verse to be the source of God's predestination. It is a love to all mankind, as in God's foreknowledge already made one with His beloved Son. (See <a href="/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>, "Thou hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me . . . for Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the praise of the glory of his grace</span>; with a view to praise being given to the glory of his grace. The purpose of grace <span class="accented">quoad</span> man, is to make him perfectly holy; <span class="accented">quoad</span> God, is to give to the universe a right conception of his grace, and draw forth corresponding tributes of praise. It is to show that Divine grace is not a limp, shallow attribute, but one of glorious riches, deserving infinite praise. The idea of the richness, fullness, abundance, of God's grace is prominent throughout the Epistle. God desires to draw attention, not only to this attribute, but to the boundlessness of it - thus to draw the love and confidence of his creatures to himself and inspire them with the desire to imitate him (comp. <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-35</a>). Wherein he abounded toward us in the Beloved. Two slight difficulties are found here - one in the text, the other in the interpretation. After <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, some copies read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span>, others <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. A.V. follows the former; R.V. the latter. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> usually means to bestow grace; sometimes, to make gracious or beautiful. The former is more in accordance with New Testament usage (Alford) and with the tenor of the passage. The glory of the grace of which God desires to create a true impression is not an abstraction, not a glory hidden away in stone inaccessible region, but a revealed glory, a communicated glory; it is revealed in the grace wherein he abounded to us, or which he freely bestowed on us, in the Beloved. The grace bestowed on believers exemplifies the glorious quality of the attribute - its glorious riches. The connection of God with Christ in the bestowal of this grace, and of believers in the reception of it, is again noted by the remarkable term, "in the Beloved." That the Father's relation to Christ was one of infinite love is a fact never to be lost sight cf. His having constituted the Beloved One the Kinsman and Mediator of sinners shows the riches of the glory of his grace. "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he hot, with him also freely give us all things?" Our union to the Beloved, our participating in all the blessings of his purchase, our becoming heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ, further illustrates the glorious riches of his grace. "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] praise</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epainon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1868.htm">Strong's 1868: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commendation, praise, approval.
