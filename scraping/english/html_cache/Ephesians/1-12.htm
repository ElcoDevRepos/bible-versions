The "we" refers to the Jewish believers, including Paul himself, who were among the first to receive the gospel. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where salvation was first offered to the Jews (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). The use of "we" also emphasizes the collective identity of believers as part of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>who were the first to hope in Christ</b><br>The early Jewish Christians were the first to place their hope in the Messiah, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the coming Savior (<a href="/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a>). This hope is not merely wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's promises. The phrase underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, as the hope in Christ is the fulfillment of the messianic expectations rooted in Jewish tradition.<p><b>would be for the praise of His glory</b><br>The ultimate purpose of the believers' hope and faith is to bring glory to God. This reflects a central theme in Scripture, where God's actions in history, including the redemption through Christ, are intended to reveal His glory (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). The phrase also connects to the doxological focus of Ephesians, where the church's existence and mission are to reflect God's glory to the world (<a href="/ephesians/3-21.htm">Ephesians 3:21</a>).

But the meaning of the phrase "who first hoped" (or, more properly, <span class= "ital">who have hoped beforehand</span>) is less obvious. Our version seems to interpret it simply of "believing before" the Gentiles, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of being the "first believers;" and this interpretation may be defended by the analogy of certain cases in which the same prefix signifying "beforehand" has this sense (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>; <a href="/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a>; <a href="/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

But the more general analogy strongly supports the other interpretation, "who have hoped in the Christ before He came"--that is, who, taught by prophecy, entering into that vision of a great future which pervades the older Covenant, looked forward "to the hope of Israel," and "waited for the consolation of Israel;" and who accordingly in due time became, on the Day of Pentecost, the firstfruits of His salvation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we should be to the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ.</span> The "we" which hitherto has been applied to the whole Church, Jewish and Gentile, begins to have a more limited reference, and to contrast with "you" in ver. 13.
