In biblical terms, "darkness" often symbolizes ignorance, sin, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The Ephesians, like all humanity, were once living in sin and under the influence of the world and its ruler, Satan (<a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>). This darkness is not just an external condition but an internal reality, indicating a life devoid of God's truth and righteousness.<p><b>but now you are light in the Lord</b><br>The transformation from darkness to light signifies a profound change brought about by faith in Jesus Christ. "Light" in Scripture represents truth, holiness, and the presence of God (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>). This change is not self-generated but is a result of being "in the Lord," indicating a union with Christ. This transformation is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, where the people walking in darkness have seen a great light, pointing to the coming of the Messiah.<p><b>Walk as children of light</b><br>This exhortation calls believers to live in a manner consistent with their new identity. "Walk" in biblical language refers to one's conduct or way of life (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>). As "children of light," believers are to reflect the character of God, who is light (1 <a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). This involves living in truth, righteousness, and goodness, contrasting with their former way of life. The imagery of light and darkness is also reminiscent of the creation narrative, where God separated light from darkness (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3-4</a>), symbolizing order and divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture, and it had a significant Christian community to whom Paul addressed this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Ephesian Christians were a diverse group of believers living in a city known for its pagan practices and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_from_darkness_to_light.htm">Transformation from Darkness to Light</a></b><br>Believers undergo a radical transformation when they come to faith in Christ.

(See <a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-2.htm" title=" To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Colossians 1:2</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm" title="But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.">1Thessalonians 5:4</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6-7</a>; <a href="/context/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1John 2:9-10</a>.) For here the outward element of light or darkness is said to pervade the inner nature of the soul. (1) Christ is the "true Light," the "Sun of Righteousness" (<a href="/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4-9</a>; <a href="/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>; <a href="/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>; <a href="/john/9-5.htm" title="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.">John 9:5</a>; <a href="/john/12-46.htm" title="I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.">John 12:46</a>). His servants are sometimes mere secondary lights (or "candles") (<a href="/context/luke/11-33.htm" title="No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.">Luke 11:33-34</a>; <a href="/luke/11-36.htm" title="If your whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you light.">Luke 11:36</a>; <a href="/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), kindled from His rays; sometimes, like the moon or planets, they are said, as reflecting His light, or as having His light in them (<a href="/john/12-35.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come on you: for he that walks in darkness knows not where he goes.">John 12:35</a>), to be actually "the light of the world" (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm" title="You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.">Matthew 5:14</a>), which, however, shines as a mere reflected light, so that "men glorify" not it, but "the Father which is in heaven" (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a>). They thus become light, but only "in the Lord:" that is, as being made one with Him. (2) So, on the other hand, they who walk in darkness are said to be themselves darkness--new sources, so to speak, of the darkness which hates and quenches light, both to themselves and to others. "The light" which is in them "becomes darkness;" "and how great is that darkness!" (<a href="/matthew/6-23.htm" title="But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!">Matthew 6:23</a>.) As there is a natural delight in giving light, so the reprobate state is distinguished by a horrible pleasure in spreading the cloud of delusion, sin, or unbelief, by which to hide God from man. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord.</span> Another expressive "but." To make the contrast more emphatic, it is not said, "ye were in darkness, but are now in light;" but, "ye were darkness itself, and are now light itself," and this last is explained by the usual formula, "in the Lord." There was a celebrated Ephesian philosopher, Alexander, who was called "The Light;" but not from that source had the light come. The idea of <span class="accented">light-giving</span> is also involved in their being light. "Arise, shine, for thy light is come." <span class="cmt_word">Walk as children of light.</span> Another expressive image, denoting close connection with light, as if they were actually born of it; hence their lives should be full of it.
