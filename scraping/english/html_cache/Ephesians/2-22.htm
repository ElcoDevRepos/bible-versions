The "Him" refers to Jesus Christ, who is the cornerstone of the Christian faith. In the broader context of Ephesians, Paul highlights the unity and reconciliation brought through Christ. This echoes <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him as essential for spiritual life and growth.<p><b>you too</b><br>Paul is addressing the Gentile believers in Ephesus, affirming their inclusion in God's redemptive plan. Historically, Gentiles were considered outsiders to the covenant promises given to Israel. This phrase underscores the breaking down of barriers, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>, where Christ is described as our peace, who has made both groups one.<p><b>are being built together</b><br>The imagery of construction suggests an ongoing process, indicating that the church is continually growing and being shaped. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>, where believers are described as living stones being built into a spiritual house. The communal aspect is emphasized, highlighting the importance of unity and cooperation among believers.<p><b>into a dwelling place for God</b><br>This phrase reflects the Old Testament concept of the temple as God's dwelling place among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27-30</a>). However, the New Testament reveals a shift from a physical temple to a spiritual one, where God resides within His people collectively. This transformation is a fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>, where God promises to dwell among His people.<p><b>in His Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the agent through whom God dwells within believers. This aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>, where Paul states that believers are God's temple and that His Spirit dwells in them. The presence of the Spirit signifies God's active involvement in the life of the church, guiding, empowering, and sanctifying believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

But it may also illustrate to us the character of the unity of the Church, as, primarily, a direct individual unity with Christ--each stone being itself a complete and living stone--and, secondarily and indirectly, an unity with others and with the whole. The Ephesians are said to be, not a part of the habitation of God, but themselves built into Christ for an habitation of God--"Christ dwelling in their hearts by faith," and they "therefore being filled with all the fulness of God" (<a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>). The addition of this clause, therefore, links the teaching of this Epistle with the earlier and more individual forms of teaching, noted on <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>.<p>This verse contains, again, the declaration (as in <a href="/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) of the union of Christians with each Person of THE HOLY TRINITY. The soul made one with THE SON becomes a temple for the indwelling of THE FATHER in the gift of THE HOLY SPIRIT. (See <a href="/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In whom ye also are builded together.</span> Once more the vitalizing element - "in whom;" for this is better than "in which," inasmuch as this verse is substantially a reduplication of the preceding one, making special application of the same subject to the Ephesians. The person changes from the third to the second, to make emphatic that the Ephesians shared this great privilege. Their relations towards believing Jews and other believers in the Church were not accidental; they were "builded together," compacted into each other, and ought to work together towards God's great ends. <span class="cmt_word">For a habitation of God in the Spirit.</span> Not many habitations, but one. The Church as a temple is the dwelling-place of God. Here he bestows his fullness, so that when the temple is completed it will exhibit, as fully as a created thing can, the manifold glory of God. "In the Spirit" in this verse corresponds to "in the Lord" in the previous one. The actual communication of Divine properties to finite beings is the work of the Third Person. In this verse, again, we find the three Persons of the Trinity: the temple is the habitation of the First Person; the source of its life and growth and symmetry is the Son; the actual up-building and glorifying of it is by the Spirit. This is the climax of privilege, and no contrast could be greater than that between the death in trespasses and sins with which the chapter begins, and this sublime temple, where God dwells and bestows his fullness, with which it ends. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And] in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
