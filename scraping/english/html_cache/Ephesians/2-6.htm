In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing the transformation from spiritual death to life. This concept is rooted in the idea of being born again, as seen in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>. Theologically, it signifies the believer's new identity and status in Christ. The resurrection of Christ is a pivotal event in Christian doctrine, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. The phrase also reflects the power of God, who alone can raise the dead, as demonstrated in the resurrection of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>).<p><b>and seated us with Him</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the believer's position of authority and rest in Christ. In ancient times, being seated with a ruler indicated a position of favor and shared authority. This imagery is consistent with the cultural context of the Roman Empire, where seating arrangements were significant in determining one's status. Theologically, it suggests that believers share in Christ's victory and reign, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>, where those who overcome are promised to sit with Christ on His throne. This seating is not a future promise but a present reality, indicating the believer's current spiritual authority.<p><b>in the heavenly realms</b><br>The "heavenly realms" refer to the spiritual dimension where Christ reigns. This term is unique to Ephesians, appearing five times throughout the letter, and it underscores the spiritual nature of the believer's blessings and battles (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 1</a>:20, 3:10, 6:12). The heavenly realms are contrasted with the earthly realm, highlighting the believer's citizenship in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>). This phrase also connects to the idea of spiritual warfare, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are called to stand against spiritual forces in these realms.<p><b>in Christ Jesus</b><br>The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is central to Pauline theology, emphasizing the believer's union with Christ. This union is the basis for all spiritual blessings, as outlined in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>. Being "in Christ" signifies a profound spiritual relationship, where believers are identified with Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension. This concept is echoed in <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul states that he has been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer he who lives, but Christ lives in him. The phrase underscores the transformative power of the gospel, which brings believers into a new covenant relationship with God through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who initiates salvation and raises believers with Christ.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ (Jesus)</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection and ascension make possible the spiritual elevation of believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Christ and are spiritually united with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_realms.htm">Heavenly Realms</a></b><br>The spiritual dimension where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, representing authority and victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_resurrection.htm">Spiritual Resurrection</a></b><br>Believers are spiritually resurrected with Christ, signifying a new life and identity in Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/position_of_authority.htm">Position of Authority</a></b><br>Being seated with Christ in the heavenly realms indicates a position of authority and victory over sin and spiritual forces.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_perspective.htm">Heavenly Perspective</a></b><br>Christians are called to live with a heavenly perspective, focusing on eternal realities rather than earthly concerns.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_with_christ.htm">Unity with Christ</a></b><br>Our spiritual union with Christ is foundational to our identity and empowers us to live out our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/assurance_of_salvation.htm">Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>This verse provides assurance of our salvation and eternal security, as our position in Christ is secure.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_2_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_2_6_Our_position_with_Christ.htm">How does Ephesians 2:6 describe our spiritual position with Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_seated_with_Him_mean.htm">What does being "seated with Him" imply about our authority in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_2_6_Boost_daily_faith.htm">How can Ephesians 2:6 inspire confidence in your daily spiritual walk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Eph_2_6_Col_3_1-3_on_heavenly_focus.htm">Connect Ephesians 2:6 with Colossians 3:1-3 on our heavenly focus.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_embody_being_raised_with_Him.htm">How can you live out the truth of being "raised up with Him"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_seated_us_with_Him_in_Eph_2_6.htm">What does "seated us with Him in the heavenly realms" mean in Ephesians 2:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_2_6_vs_earthly_identity_status.htm">How does Ephesians 2:6 challenge the concept of earthly identity and status?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Eph_2_6_shape_salvation_grace.htm">In what way does Ephesians 2:6 influence the understanding of salvation and grace?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'already_but_not_yet'_mean.htm">What does "Already but Not Yet" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'seated_in_heaven'_mean.htm">What does "Seated in Heavenly Places" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_reward_for_secret_fasting.htm">What does 'Seated in Heavenly Places' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_can_i_emulate_christ_more_closely.htm">How can I emulate Christ more closely?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ephesians 2:6 Mean</div><b>And God raised us up</b><p>- Paul has just reminded us that we &#8220;were dead in our trespasses and sins&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>). A dead person cannot revive himself; the initiative belongs solely to God.<p>- The same power that &#8220;He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>) was personally applied to us. God&#8217;s act is historical, not hypothetical.<p>- <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a> echoes this: &#8220;We too might walk in newness of life&#8230; united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection.&#8221;<p>- Because the resurrection of Jesus is factual, our spiritual resurrection is equally factual right now, not merely symbolic or future-tense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with Christ</b><p>- Union with Christ is the heart of salvation. Everything God gives, He gives &#8220;with&#8221; or &#8220;in&#8221; His Son.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12-13</a>&#8212;&#8220;You were raised with Him through your faith&#8230; He made you alive with Christ.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Since you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above.&#8221;<p>- This &#8220;withness&#8221; means His story has become our story: His death counts as our death to sin; His life counts as our new life.<p>- Practically, our identity is no longer centered on past failures but on present fellowship with a living Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and seated us with Him</b><p>- Resurrection life quickly moves to resurrection authority. To be seated is to be settled, welcomed, and given a place of honor.<p>- <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-23</a> shows where Christ is seated&#8212;&#8220;far above every rule and authority.&#8221; By seating us with Him, God places us under His victory, not under the world&#8217;s tyranny.<p>- <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a> promises, &#8220;I will grant the one who overcomes the right to sit with Me on My throne.&#8221; In God&#8217;s eyes that is already true; we simply await the visible manifestation.<p>- This seated position also implies rest. Just as Christ&#8217;s redemptive work is finished (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>), our acceptance before God is settled. We serve from rest, not for rest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the heavenly realms</b><p>- &#8220;Heavenly realms&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 1</a>:20) describes the spiritual sphere where ultimate reality is determined.<p>- <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a> reminds us, &#8220;Our citizenship is in heaven,&#8221; meaning our loyalties, resources, and rights flow from there.<p>- <a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2-3</a> adds, &#8220;Your life is now hidden with Christ in God.&#8221; Though our feet remain on earth, our lives are anchored where Christ reigns.<p>- This present heavenly positioning empowers daily warfare. Later in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> we stand against spiritual forces &#8220;in the heavenly realms&#8221; from a place of shared authority, not intimidation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Christ Jesus</b><p>- Paul circles back to emphasize the location of every blessing: inside the person of Christ.<p>- <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.&#8221; All that is true of Him is counted true of us because God sees us enclosed in His Son.<p>- <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a> celebrates that God &#8220;is the source of your life in Christ Jesus,&#8221; giving righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.<p>- Being &#8220;in Christ Jesus&#8221; guards us from pride; none of these privileges originate in us but flow through permanent union with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God intervened while we were spiritually lifeless, literally raising us up, uniting us with His resurrected Son, granting us a settled seat of honor and authority in the heavenly realms&#8212;all securely contained &#8220;in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Our present identity, security, and victory derive from this accomplished fact, empowering us to live on earth from a heavenly position.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And hath raised us up with him</span> (comp. <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>); so that we no longer walk "according to the course of this world," but according to the life of Christ; we walk "in newness of life." <span class="cmt_word">And seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</span> As God placed Jesus at his right hand in heaven, so he has placed his people with him in heavenly places; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> places where the privileges of heaven are dispensed, where the air of heaven is breathed, where the fellowship and the enjoyment of heaven are known, where an elevation of spirit is experienced as if heaven were begun. Such was the case of the three disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration; of the two on the way to Emmaus, when their heart burned within them; of the beloved disciple when he was "in the Spirit on the Lord's day;" of many at the Holy Supper, or in fervent communion with brother and sister believers, when they seem at the very gate of heaven. This is sometimes the experience at conversion, but the vividness of the feeling does not always abide. The repetition of "in Christ Jesus" in this connection emphasizes the fact that this gracious proceeding of God towards us is in immediate connection with the work and person of Christ. It is as being one with Christ Jesus that all this raising up comes to us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[God] raised [us] up with [Christ]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#942;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(syn&#275;geiren)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4891.htm">Strong's 4891: </a> </span><span class="str2">To raise along with.
