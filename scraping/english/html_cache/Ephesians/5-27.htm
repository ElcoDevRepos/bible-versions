The imagery of a bride being presented to the bridegroom is rooted in Jewish wedding customs, where the bride is prepared and adorned for her husband. This reflects the intimate and covenantal relationship between Christ and the Church. The concept of glory here signifies a state of honor and splendor, free from any imperfection. This presentation is not just a future event but an ongoing process of sanctification, aligning with passages like <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-8</a>, where the Church is depicted as the Bride of Christ, clothed in fine linen, representing the righteous acts of the saints.<p><b>without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish</b><br>The language of "stain," "wrinkle," and "blemish" draws from the Old Testament sacrificial system, where offerings to God had to be without defect (<a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>). This imagery underscores the purity and perfection required of the Church, reflecting Christ's own holiness. The absence of stain or wrinkle suggests a spiritual purity and maturity, free from sin and moral corruption. This aligns with <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, where Paul expresses his desire to present the Church as a pure virgin to Christ. The process of becoming without blemish is ongoing, involving the work of the Holy Spirit in sanctification (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>but holy and blameless</b><br>The terms "holy" and "blameless" are often used in Scripture to describe the character of God's people. Holiness implies being set apart for God's purposes, reflecting His nature and character. Blamelessness suggests a state of moral integrity and uprightness. This echoes <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, where believers are chosen to be holy and blameless before God. The call to holiness is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice and the believer's response in living a life that honors God. This transformation is both a positional reality in Christ and a practical pursuit in the believer's daily life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>Referred to metaphorically as the "bride" of Christ, the church is the collective body of believers in Jesus Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central to this passage, Christ is depicted as the bridegroom who desires to present the church as pure and holy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>An ancient city where the church to whom this letter was addressed was located.

They are most commonly sacrificial, corresponding (see <a href="/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>) to the sacrificial use of the word "present." Here, however, they are seen clearly to have reference to the nuptial metaphor by what goes before.<p>In all this we have a picture which properly belongs to the Church in glory, and which is fully drawn out under the same metaphor as <a href="/context/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7-9</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/21-9.htm" title="And there came to me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.">Revelation 21:9-10</a>; for only in it can the description be fully realised. In capacity and promise it belongs to the whole Church militant; in reality, but in imperfection, to the Church invisible on earth; in absolute perfection to the Church triumphant in heaven. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he might present to himself the Church glorious.</span> The ultimate end, to which ver. 26 is introductory. Christ both gives and takes the bride; he presents her to himself - the day of his espousals being in the state of glory (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and all the training of this life being designed to fit her for that condition. She becomes glorious at last through assimilation to himself (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</span> The idea is that of a body perfectly free from blemish, typical of a soul perfectly delivered from sin - of a character perfected in all grace and goodness. <span class="cmt_word">But that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> The same truth expressed in positive form, which in the preceding clause is expressed in the negative. Nothing could more clearly denote perfection of character - the full development of the character with whatever of variety may arise from differences in natural gifts and constitution, or convey a more glorious idea of the destiny of redeemed humanity. To be, as it were, the bride of Christ is a high destiny in point of <span class="accented">condition</span>; but it would be miserable if character did not tally with condition; this agreement, however, is secured, for the Church is to be holy and without blemish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[and] to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
