The concept of Christ dwelling in the heart signifies a deep, personal relationship with Jesus, beyond mere intellectual assent. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. This indwelling is made possible "through faith," highlighting the necessity of trust and belief in Jesus for salvation and spiritual growth. The idea of God dwelling among His people has roots in the Old Testament, such as in the tabernacle and temple (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), and finds its fulfillment in the New Covenant through Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). This indwelling is a transformative process, aligning the believer's life with the character and purposes of Christ.<p><b>Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,</b><br>The imagery of being "rooted and grounded" suggests stability and strength, akin to a tree with deep roots or a building with a solid foundation. This metaphor indicates that love is the essential foundation for the Christian life. Love, as described in the New Testament, is selfless and sacrificial, modeled after Christ's love for humanity (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13, 1</a> <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>). The dual metaphor of agriculture and architecture underscores the importance of both growth and stability in the believer's life. This love is not merely an emotion but an active, living principle that influences every aspect of a believer's conduct. The call to be rooted and grounded in love connects to the greatest commandments to love God and love others (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>), and it is through this love that believers reflect the nature of Christ to the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to encourage and instruct the church in Ephesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose indwelling presence in believers' hearts is emphasized in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the early Christian church to which Paul writes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, a community of believers in Ephesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_love.htm">Faith and Love</a></b><br>Key themes in this passage, highlighting the means by which Christ dwells in believers and the foundation of their spiritual life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_indwelling_presence.htm">Christ's Indwelling Presence</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of Christ dwelling in our hearts as a personal and transformative relationship.<br><br>Encourage believers to cultivate a heart where Christ feels at home through faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_the_foundation.htm">Faith as the Foundation</a></b><br>Highlight faith as the means by which Christ dwells in us, urging believers to strengthen their faith through prayer, study, and community.<br><br>Discuss the Greek word "pistis" (faith) as trust and reliance on Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rooted_and_grounded_in_love.htm">Rooted and Grounded in Love</a></b><br>Explain the agricultural and architectural metaphors of being "rooted" and "grounded," signifying stability and nourishment in love.<br><br>Encourage believers to let love be the foundation of all their actions and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_love_in_the_christian_life.htm">The Role of Love in the Christian Life</a></b><br>Discuss how love is both the root and the fruit of a life in Christ, impacting how we interact with others.<br><br>Challenge believers to express love in practical ways, reflecting Christ's love to the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_3_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 3:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Christ_dwell_in_your_heart.htm">How can Christ dwell in your heart through faith, as Ephesians 3:17 suggests?

All of this happens in the rich environment of divine love, enabling us to grow, stand firm, and live out the life of Christ within.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</span>--What that indwelling power is he now indicates, so passing to another Person of the Holy Trinity. It is (see <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>) "Christ in you, the hope of glory." The indwelling of Christ (as here the construction of the original plainly shows) is not a consequence of the gift of the Spirit; it is identical with it, for the office of the Holy Spirit is to implant and work out in us the likeness of Christ. So in <a href="/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16-20</a>, in immediate connection with the promise of the Comforter, we read: "I will not leave you orphaned; I will come to you." "Ye shall know that . . . ye are in me and I in you." Hence the life in the Spirit is described as "To me to live is Christ" (<a href="/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>); "I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (<a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>). Faith is simply the condition of that indwelling of Christ (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8</a>), the opening of the door to Him that He may enter in.<p>The prayer is here complete, all that follows being but consequent from it. In accordance with the universal law of revelation, all is <span class= "ital">from</span> the Father, all is <span class= "ital">through</span> the Son vouchsafing to tabernacle in our humanity, all is <span class= "ital">by</span> the Spirit effecting that indwelling of Christ in each individual soul. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</span> Reversing the usual order, the prayer begins (ver. 16) by asking the blessing of the Third Person of the Godhead; now we have a cluster of petitions connected with the Second Person. The first of these is for the indwelling of Christ in their hearts, as opposed to mere occasional visits or influences from Christ; the instrument by which this blessing is attained being their faith. Christ exercising a constant power within them, both in the active and passive movements of the heart, giving the sense of pardon and acceptance, molding the will, sweetening the emotions, enlightening and confirming the conscience, purifying the whole springs and principles of action. This to be secured by their faith, opening the door, receiving Christ in all his fullness, resting and living on him, believing his promises, and longing for his appearing the second time. <span class="cmt_word">In order that ye, having been rooted and grounded in love.</span> Two images are combined to make the idea emphatic - that of a tree and that of a building; denoting what is both the starting-point and the support of the Christian's life, viz. love. In what sense? The love of Christ is specified afterwards (ver. 19), but this may be as a pre-eminent branch of that manifold love which bears on the Christian life - the love of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the love of the brethren to one another; and the reciprocal love evoked from the believer by the reception of this love. Evidently it is implied that the Christian life can begin and flourish only in such an atmosphere of love; as warm sunshine is needed to start and advance the life of a plant, so love is needed to start and carry on the life of the soul. Experience of Divine love is a great quickening and propelling power. "One glance of God, a touch of his love, will free and enlarge the heart, so that it can deny all and part with all and make an entire renunciation of all to follow him" (Archbishop Leighton). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">so that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
