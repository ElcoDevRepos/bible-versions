It echoes <a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, where humanity is given dominion over creation, but here it is fulfilled in Christ, the ultimate Man. The imagery of placing something under one's feet is a common biblical metaphor for complete subjugation and victory, as seen in <a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>, where defeated kings are placed under the feet of the Israelites. This reflects Christ's victory over sin, death, and all spiritual powers, as further elaborated in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>.<p><b>and made Him head over everything</b><br>Christ's headship over everything indicates His preeminence and authority over all creation, both visible and invisible. This is consistent with <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, where Christ is described as the head of the body, the church, and the firstborn from the dead, so that He might have supremacy in everything. The headship of Christ is not only a position of authority but also one of source and sustenance, as the head is to the body. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of kingship, where the king was seen as the source of life and order for his people.<p><b>for the church</b><br>The church is the body of Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. This relationship between Christ and the church is central to understanding the purpose of His headship. The church is not merely an institution but a living organism, united with Christ as its head. This connection is further explored in <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23-32</a>, where the relationship between Christ and the church is likened to that of a husband and wife. The church, as the bride of Christ, is the recipient of His love, care, and leadership.

In this passage these words fill up the picture of our Lord's transcendent dignity, by the declaration of the actual subjugation of all the powers of sin and death, rising up against Him, in the spiritual war which is to go on till the appointed end. They therefore form a natural link between the description of His lordship over all created being, and of His headship over the Church, militant on earth, as well as triumphant in heaven.<p><span class= "bld">And gave</span> <span class= "bld">him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body.</span>--This is the first time that this celebrated phrase is used, describing Christ as the Head, and viewing the Church as a whole as His body. It is characteristic that in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1Corinthians 11:3</a>, Christ is called "the Head of each man," as "the man of the woman;" whereas in this Epistle Christ is the Head of the whole Church, on occasion of the same comparison (see <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>). The consideration of all Christians as the "body of Christ" is indeed found in <a href="/romans/12-4.htm" title="For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:">Romans 12:4</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1Corinthians 12:12-27</a> : but it is notable that in these passages the leading idea is, first, of the individuality of each member, and then, secondarily, of their union in one body; and in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.">1Corinthians 12:21</a>, "the head and the foot," just as much as "the eye and the hand," are simply looked upon as members. (Comp. also <a href="/1_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.">1Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1Corinthians 10:17</a>.) Here, in accordance with the great doctrine of this Epistle--the unity of the whole of humanity and of the whole Church, ideally co-extensive with that humanity, with Christ--the metaphor is changed. The body is looked upon as a whole, Christ as its Head. The idea is wrought out again and again (see <a href="/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>) in these Epistles of the Captivity. It is from these that it has become a household word in all Christian theology. With some variation it is expressed also in other metaphors--the building and the corner-stone, the bride and the bridegroom. But under the title of the "Head" Christ is looked upon especially in His ruling, guiding, originating power over the Church. Probably the idea of His being the seat of its life, though not excluded, is secondary; whereas in His own figure of the vine and the branches (<a href="/john/16-6.htm" title="But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.">John 16:6</a>) it is primary. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And put all things under his feet</span>; a strong, figurative expression, denoting high sovereignty. It does not refer merely to defeated and arrested enemies, but to the whole of creation and the fullness thereof. They are as thoroughly under Christ and at his disposal as if they were literally under his feet. As a military commander, proceeding even through his own country, has power to requisition everything needful for his army, and deal with all property as may be required for military purposes, so Christ has the whole creation at his disposal, animate and inanimate, hostile and friendly. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him to be Head over all things to the Church.</span> The exaltation of Christ is not merely an honor conferred on himself, but has also a definite practical purpose; it is for the benefit of the Church. God gave him to the Church as Head over all things. The gift of Christ to the Church is the gift of One who has sovereign authority over all things. The official subordination of Christ to the Father is recognized throughout this remarkable passage. So in Philippians, though he was "in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, he made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men." It is this Jesus, in the form of a servant and in the likeness of men, that is now Head over all things, and as such given by the Father to the Church.
