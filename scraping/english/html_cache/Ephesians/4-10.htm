Theologically, it highlights the humility of Christ, who left His divine glory to become human (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>). This descent is also seen in His death and burial, where He descended to the grave. Some interpretations suggest a descent into Hades, as referenced in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>, where Christ proclaimed victory over the spirits in prison.<p><b>is the very One who ascended</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to Christ's resurrection and ascension into heaven. After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples and others over a period of 40 days (<a href="/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>) before ascending to the right hand of the Father (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). His ascension signifies His victory over sin and death and His exaltation as Lord. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>, which Paul also quotes in <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8</a>.<p><b>above all the heavens</b><br>This phrase indicates the supreme authority and position of Christ. In Jewish cosmology, there were multiple heavens, and Christ's ascension above all signifies His ultimate sovereignty and divine authority. It echoes the language of <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>, where Jesus is described as having passed through the heavens, and <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>, where God exalts Him to the highest place.<p><b>in order to fill all things</b><br>This phrase underscores the purpose of Christ's ascension: to fill the universe with His presence and power. It reflects the idea that Christ is the head of the Church and the cosmos, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>.

In both cases the reference is more particularly to the gift of the fulness of His grace, flowing from His glorified humanity to all His members. But the words are too wide for any limitation. In heaven and earth, and the realms under the earth, His presence and sovereignty extends, by whatever means and over whatever beings He wills. In <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm" title="And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be to him that sits on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever.">Revelation 5:13</a>, accordingly, we read the ascription by "every creature in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth . . ., of blessing, honour, glory, and power to . . . the Lamb for ever and ever."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens.</span> There was a proportion between the descent and the ascent. His descent was deep - into the lower parts of earth; but his ascent was more glorious than his descent had been humbling. The Hebrew idea of various heavens is brought in; the ascent was not merely to the third heaven, but far above all heavens. <span class="cmt_word">That he might fill all things.</span> A very sublime view of the purpose for which Christ reigns on high. The specific idea with which the apostle started - to give gifts to men - is swallowed up for the moment by a view far grander and more comprehensive, "<span class="accented">to</span> fill all things." Jesus has gone on high to pour his glory and excellence over every creature in the universe who is the subject of grace, to be the Light of the world, the one Source of all good. As in the solar system it is from one sun that all the supplies of light and heat come, all the colors that beautify earth, <span class="accented">sea</span>, and sky, all the influences that ripen the grain and mature the fruit, all the chemical power that transforms and new-creates; so the ascended Jesus is the Sun of the universe; all healing, all life, all blessing are from him. It is quite in the manner of the apostle, when he introduces the mention of Christ, to be carried, in the contemplation of his person, far above the immediate occasion, and extol the infinite perfection and glory that distinguish him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
