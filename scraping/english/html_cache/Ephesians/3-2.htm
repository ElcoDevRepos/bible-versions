Ephesus was a major city in Asia Minor, a hub of early Christian activity, and Paul had spent significant time there (Acts 19). The phrase implies a shared knowledge and understanding among the believers, indicating that Paul's teachings and the events surrounding his ministry were well-known.<p><b>about the stewardship of God&#8217;s grace</b><br>The term "stewardship" refers to the responsibility and management of something entrusted to someone. In this context, it highlights Paul's role as a manager or administrator of the divine grace given to him. This grace is not just for personal salvation but is a special commission to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. The concept of stewardship is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>, where Paul describes himself as a steward of the mysteries of God. This stewardship is a divine appointment, emphasizing the responsibility and accountability Paul has in spreading the Gospel.<p><b>that was given to me</b><br>This indicates that Paul's role and mission were not self-appointed but divinely ordained. The passive construction "was given" underscores that it is God who initiates and empowers Paul's ministry. This aligns with Paul's conversion and calling on the road to Damascus (Acts 9), where Jesus directly commissions him to be a messenger to the Gentiles. It reflects the biblical theme of God choosing and equipping individuals for specific purposes, as seen with prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p><b>for you</b><br>The "you" refers to the Gentile believers, highlighting the inclusive nature of the Gospel. Paul's mission was to break down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles, as elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>, where he speaks of the unity and peace brought through Christ. This phrase emphasizes the personal and direct impact of Paul's ministry on the Ephesian believers, showing that the grace given to Paul was intended for their benefit and spiritual growth. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's plan to bless all nations through the seed of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), fulfilled in Christ and extended through Paul's apostolic mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to the Ephesians.

By saying, &#8220;Surely you have heard,&#8221; Paul underscores two things:<p>&#8226; They possess reliable, firsthand testimony of God&#8217;s work in his life, echoing <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>: &#8220;For we did not follow cleverly devised myths.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their knowledge carries responsibility; awareness of God&#8217;s action invites deeper trust and obedience, just as <a href="/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> urges believers to &#8220;pay closer attention to what we have heard.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the stewardship of God&#8217;s grace</b><p>&#8220;Stewardship&#8221; pictures a household manager entrusted with valuable resources (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1&#8211;2</a>). God&#8217;s grace is that priceless resource. In Paul&#8217;s life this stewardship involved:<p>&#8226; Receiving grace&#8212;salvation entirely &#8220;by grace&#8230;through faith&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Administering grace&#8212;proclaiming the gospel so others could share in it (<a href="/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Protecting grace&#8212;defending its purity against distortion (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6&#8211;9</a>).<p>Like Joseph managing Potiphar&#8217;s estate (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4&#8211;6</a>), Paul manages a spiritual estate: &#8220;the glorious gospel of the blessed God&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that was given to me</b><p>Grace is never earned; it is &#8220;given.&#8221; <a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> records Jesus telling Ananias, &#8220;He is My chosen instrument.&#8221; Paul emphasizes:<p>&#8226; Personal calling&#8212;God singled him out despite his past (<a href="/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Divine enablement&#8212;&#8220;By the grace of God I am what I am&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Apostolic authority&#8212;the message carries weight because the Sender is God (<a href="/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>His life showcases <a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>: &#8220;God&#8217;s gifts and His call are irrevocable.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for you</b><p>The stewardship is not self-serving.

The verse invites believers to recognize God-given stewardship, embrace grace personally, and pass it on for the good of others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">If ye have heard.</span>--The original word rendered "if" (the same used below, <a href="/ephesians/4-21.htm" title="If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:">Ephesians 4:21</a>, and in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.">2Corinthians 5:3</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-4.htm" title="Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>) conveys, in such collocation as this, a supposition which is only a supposition in form--a half-ironical reference to a thing not doubtful. The sense is "if (that is)," or "if, as I suppose," "ye heard the dispensation," &c. The passage bears on the question whether the Epistle was an encyclical letter, or one addressed to the Ephesian Church. The argument which has been drawn from it in the former direction is not so strong as appears in the English; for the original implies no doubt that the readers of the Epistle had heard, and the hearing might have been not about St. Paul, but from St. Paul himself. Still, there is a vague generality about the expression, which suits well an address to the Asiatic churches generally, but could hardly have been used to a church so well known and beloved as Ephesus, where "the signs of an Apostle" had been wrought abundantly.<p><span class= "bld">The dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward.</span>--The descriptive clause, "which is given me to you-ward," is seen in the original to belong to the word <span class= "ital">"</span>grace," not (as our version might suggest) to "dispensation." The grace of God is spoken of as given to St. Paul, not so much for his own sake, as for ministration to them of the dispensation described in the next verse. We find there that the revelation of salvation to the Gentiles was the "dispensation," that is (much as in <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), the peculiar office in the ministration of the grace of God to the world, assigned to St. Paul by His wisdom. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1Corinthians 1:17-24</a>, "God sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel . . . We preach Christ crucified . . . unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God.</span> Here begins the digression. The words, "if ye have heard," etc., do not denote an uncertainty, but are a delicate reminder. Doubtless they had heard of the matter when he was at Ephesus, and, as he remarks in ver. 3, he had already written briefly on it. Grace is here used in a more restricted sense than in <a href="/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a> - in the sense of Divine favor, honor, privilege - the same as in ver. 8, "To me... is this favor given." Which is given me to you-ward. The grace or favor meant is that whereby Paul was constituted the apostle of the Gentiles. Deeply though he felt his being sent away from preaching to his countrymen (<a href="/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>), he took kindly to the new sphere allotted to him, and magnified his office (<a href="/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(ge)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1065.htm">Strong's 1065: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle of emphasis or qualification.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have heard about</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7968;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
