In the Old Testament, the mystery of the Gentiles being fellow heirs with Israel was not fully disclosed. Prophets like Isaiah hinted at the inclusion of Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>), but the full understanding was not given until the New Testament era. This underscores the unfolding nature of God's redemptive plan throughout history.<p><b>as it has now been revealed by the Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in revealing divine truths. In the New Testament, the Spirit is the agent of revelation, guiding the apostles into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).

The phrase "the sons of men" (except that it is once used in <a href="/mark/3-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and blasphemies with which soever they shall blaspheme:">Mark 3:28</a>) is peculiar to the Old Testament, where it is of frequent use in the poetical books, and it is notable that in Ezekiel it is the name by which the prophet himself is constantly addressed. Hence, although it is probably wrong to restrict to the children of Israel, or to the prophets, words which by their very nature apply to all mankind, yet the phrase seems to be used with a suggestion of the contrast between the old dispensation and the new. (Comp. our Lord's words in <a href="/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>, "Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.")<p><span class= "bld">As it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.</span>--The application of the epithet "holy" to the Apostles has been thought strange as coming from one of their number; and it is worth notice that this exceptional application is certainly more appropriate to the comparatively impersonal style of an encyclical epistle. But the epithet (applied to the Old Testament prophets in <a href="/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>; <a href="/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-2.htm" title="That you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Savior:">2Peter 3:2</a>), like the frequent use of it as the substantive "saints," in application to all Christians, refers not to personal character, but to official call and privilege. In this passage it is clear that it is used thus, in emphatic contrast with "the sons of men" above, and in connection with the following words, "in the Spirit." The contrast here briefly conveyed is the same which is drawn out in 1 Corinthians 2 between the "wisdom of men," and the "wisdom of God," sanctifying, and so enlightening, the Christian soul. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations.</span> Though not a new purpose, the knowledge of it is new. Abraham, David, and the prophets, however much they knew of Christ and the fullness of blessing in him for all the families of the earth, did not know the full extent of God's grace to the Gentiles - did not know that the middle wall was to be wholly broken down, and all inequality removed. This might seem to throw some doubt on the reality of this doctrine; but it was on purpose that God kept it secret, and those by whom he has now revealed it are worthy of all regard. <span class="cmt_word">As it has now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit.</span> It is not revealed to Paul only, although he has got the privilege of announcing it to the Gentiles, but to the whole body of "holy apostles and prophets." The designation, "holy apostles," is rare; it is used here to magnify the office, to show that those whom the Head of the Church had set apart for himself were fit instruments to receive so important a revelation. "Prophets" here are undoubtedly New Testament prophets (see <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>), the contrast being with "sons of men in other generations." Reference may be made to the experience and decree of the Council of Jerusalem, guided by the Holy Spirit (see <a href="/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was not made known</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(egn&#333;risth&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1107.htm">Strong's 1107: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make known, declare, know, discover.
