"But now" indicates a change brought about by divine intervention. The phrase "in Christ Jesus" is central to Pauline theology, emphasizing the believer's union with Christ. This union is not merely positional but transformative, affecting one's identity and relationship with God. The concept of being "in Christ" is foundational, appearing frequently in Paul's letters, signifying the believer's incorporation into the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.<p><b>you who once were far away</b><br>This refers to the Gentiles who were previously excluded from the covenantal promises given to Israel. In the historical context, Gentiles were considered outsiders, both spiritually and socially, lacking the privileges of the Jewish people. The phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>, where God promises peace to those "far and near." The distance is not just geographical but spiritual, highlighting the separation from God due to sin and the lack of access to the covenant community.<p><b>have been brought near</b><br>This indicates a reversal of the previous alienation. The language of being "brought near" is reminiscent of temple worship, where proximity to God was a privilege of the Jewish people. In the Old Testament, nearness to God was associated with the temple and the sacrificial system. Now, through Christ, Gentiles are granted access to God, symbolizing reconciliation and the breaking down of barriers. This nearness is not just a physical or social change but a profound spiritual reality.<p><b>through the blood of Christ</b><br>The means by which this nearness is achieved is through the sacrificial death of Jesus. The "blood of Christ" is a reference to His atoning sacrifice, fulfilling the Old Testament sacrificial system. This phrase underscores the cost of reconciliation and the seriousness of sin. The blood signifies the new covenant, as Jesus Himself stated during the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>). It fulfills the prophetic imagery of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> and the Passover lamb in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, typifying Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the church to whom this letter was addressed was located.

They had power now "to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus" (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now</span>; antithesis to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 11, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span> in ver. 12. Another of the very powerful "<span class="accented">buts"</span> of this Epistle, completely reversing the picture going before (see ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus.</span> This expression is the pivot of the Epistle, denoting, not only that Christ Jesus is the Source of blessing, but also that we get the blessing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by vital union and fellowship with, him. The "without Christ" of ver. 12 contrasts powerfully with "in Christ Jesus" of this verse; and the addition of "Jesus" to the name is significant, denoting his saving power, denoting One who is not merely an official Savior, but to whom we get linked by all manner of endearing qualities and personal attractions, whose human name is Jesus, because he saves his people from their sins. <span class="cmt_word">Ye that once were far off are become near.</span> The apostle has slidden into a new figure; formerly the contrast was between death and life, now it is between distance and nearness. Not merely geographical distance, or remoteness in respect of outward position, but moral distance too: ye were far off from God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his favor, his fellowship, his gracious pardoning and renewing grace.

Your orbit is changed to a near and blessed position, where the light of God's countenance falls upon you. <span class="cmt_word">In the blood of Christ.</span> This is the particular instrument of the change; not merely Christ manifesting the Father's readiness to receive you, but shedding his blood to make atonement for you (see <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (not merely <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) is again significant, denoting more than the instrumentality, viz. personal connection with the blood, as if sprinkled on us, so that we are symbolically in it.
