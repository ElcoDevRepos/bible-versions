The "armor of God" is a metaphor for the spiritual resources provided by God to believers. In the Roman context, soldiers wore armor for protection in battle, symbolizing the need for Christians to be prepared for spiritual warfare. The full armor includes truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation, and the word of God, as detailed in the surrounding verses. This imagery connects to <a href="/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a>, where God Himself is depicted as a warrior wearing armor, highlighting the divine origin and power of this protection.<p><b>so that when the day of evil comes</b><br>The "day of evil" refers to times of intense spiritual challenge or temptation. Historically, this could relate to periods of persecution faced by early Christians, such as under Roman rule. It also signifies any moment when believers face trials or moral testing. This phrase underscores the inevitability of such times, echoing Jesus' warnings about trials in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>. The anticipation of these challenges calls for readiness and vigilance.<p><b>you will be able to stand your ground</b><br>"Stand your ground" conveys the idea of maintaining one's position and not yielding to the enemy. In a military sense, it implies holding a defensive position against an attack. Spiritually, it means remaining firm in faith and conviction despite opposition. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>, which urges believers to be watchful and stand firm in the faith. The ability to stand is not through human strength but through reliance on God's power and provision.<p><b>and having done everything, to stand</b><br>This phrase suggests a comprehensive effort in preparation and action. "Having done everything" implies that believers must actively engage in spiritual disciplines, such as prayer, study of Scripture, and living out their faith. The ultimate goal is to remain steadfast, as seen in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, which speaks of the blessedness of those who persevere under trial. The repetition of "to stand" emphasizes the importance of endurance and resilience in the Christian life, reflecting the victory and stability found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to encourage and instruct the early Christian church in Ephesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis.
