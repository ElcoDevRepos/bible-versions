In the Roman world, ambassadors were highly respected, and their messages were taken seriously. Despite his physical chains, Paul emphasizes his spiritual authority and mission. His imprisonment in Rome (<a href="/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16-31</a>) serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to the Gospel. The imagery of chains also reflects the cost of discipleship and the reality of persecution faced by early Christians. This phrase connects to <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, where Paul describes believers as ambassadors for Christ, tasked with spreading the message of reconciliation.<p><b>Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly,</b><br>Paul requests prayer for boldness in proclaiming the Gospel, underscoring the importance of divine empowerment in ministry. Despite his extensive experience and previous boldness (<a href="/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27-28</a>), Paul acknowledges his need for continued courage. This plea for prayer highlights the spiritual warfare context of <a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God. The request for fearlessness resonates with <a href="/acts/4-29.htm">Acts 4:29-31</a>, where the early church prayed for boldness amidst persecution, and God responded by filling them with the Holy Spirit.<p><b>as I should.</b><br>Paul's statement "as I should" reflects his sense of duty and responsibility to fulfill his calling. It implies an understanding of the divine mandate to preach the Gospel, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>, where Paul declares, "Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!" This phrase also suggests a standard of faithfulness and obedience expected of all believers, aligning with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. Paul's commitment serves as a model for Christians to proclaim the truth with integrity and courage, regardless of circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing from prison, referring to himself as an "ambassador in chains."

It occurs also in <a href="/mark/5-4.htm" title="Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.">Mark 5:4</a>, <a href="/luke/8-29.htm" title="(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>, where it is distinguished from a "fetter" properly so called, as binding the feet, and therefore obviously signifies a "manacle" binding the hand. Both are included (see <a href="/luke/8-29.htm" title="(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)">Luke 8:29</a>) in the general word "bonds." The allusion is undoubtedly to the custom of chaining the prisoner by the hand to the soldier who kept him. Thus in <a href="/acts/12-6.htm" title="And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.">Acts 12:6</a> we read that Peter "was sleeping between two soldiers," and therefore "bound with two manacles;" and in <a href="/acts/21-33.htm" title="Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.">Acts 21:33</a> that a similar precaution was used on the first apprehension of St. Paul. Here the singular number is probably to be understood literally. St. Paul was free except for the one chain, which the soldier was responsible for holding, and perhaps did not always think it needful to hold. That chain he seems to speak of as the badge of his ambassadorial dignity. To ambassadors, indeed, it belongs to be safe from imprisonment; but it was his greater glory to wear the chain for Christ. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For which I am an ambassador in chains.</span> Thereby not only physically helpless, but in danger of being subdued into tameness, the ordinary effect of captivity, and thus reduced to a spirit not befitting the bearer of a great message from the King of kings. <span class="cmt_word">That in it</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the matter of it, of the gospel - I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#8050;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(hyper)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5228.htm">Strong's 5228: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gen: in behalf of; acc: above. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">which</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am an ambassador</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#949;&#973;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(presbeu&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4243.htm">Strong's 4243: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be aged, act as an ambassador.
