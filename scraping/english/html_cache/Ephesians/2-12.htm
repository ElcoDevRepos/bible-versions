In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing Gentile believers who were once outside the covenant community. Being "separate from Christ" indicates a lack of relationship with the Messiah, who is central to salvation. This separation highlights the universal need for reconciliation through Jesus, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<p><b>alienated from the commonwealth of Israel</b><br>The term "alienated" suggests a state of exclusion or being an outsider. The "commonwealth of Israel" refers to the national and spiritual identity of Israel as God's chosen people. Historically, Israel was set apart by God through the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Gentiles, not being part of this covenant community, were considered outsiders to the blessings and promises given to Israel. This alienation underscores the division between Jews and Gentiles, which Christ came to abolish (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>and strangers to the covenants of the promise</b><br>"Covenants of the promise" refers to the various covenants God made with Israel, including the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and Davidic covenants. These covenants contained promises of land, nationhood, and blessing, ultimately pointing to the coming Messiah. Gentiles, being "strangers," were not originally part of these covenantal promises. However, through Christ, Gentiles are grafted into these promises, as explained in <a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>.<p><b>without hope</b><br>The absence of hope reflects the spiritual despair of those outside of Christ. In the ancient world, hope was often tied to religious and cultural identity. For Gentiles, lacking the promises and covenants of Israel meant living without the hope of redemption and eternal life. This hopelessness is contrasted with the hope found in Christ, who is described as our hope in <a href="/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>.<p><b>and without God in the world</b><br>Being "without God" (Greek: atheos) signifies a life devoid of the true knowledge and relationship with the one true God. In the Greco-Roman world, many gods were worshipped, but they did not provide the personal relationship and salvation offered by the God of Israel. This phrase emphasizes the spiritual void and idolatry prevalent among Gentiles before coming to faith in Christ. The transformation from being "without God" to being reconciled with Him is a central theme in the gospel message, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the

That condition is first summed up in one expression. They were "separate from Christ." Then from this are drawn two gloomy consequences: first (1), that they had no part in God's special covenant, "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel," and so "strangers to the (often repeated) covenants of the promise" of the Messiah; next (2), that, thus left in "the world," they had "no hope" of spiritual life and immortality, and were "godless" in thought and act. For Christ is at once the end and substance of the covenant of Israel, and the Revealer of God, and therefore of spiritual life in man, to all mankind. To be without Him is to lose both covenant and light. On (1) it is to be noted that the word used is not "aliens," but "alienated." implying--what is again and again declared to us--that the covenant with Israel, as it was held in trust for the blessing of "all families of the earth," so also was simply the true birthright of humanity, from which mankind had fallen. The first "covenant" in scripture (<a href="/context/genesis/9-8.htm" title="And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,">Genesis 9:8-17</a>) is with the whole of the post-diluvian race, and is expressly connected with the reality of "the image of God" in man (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>). The succeeding covenants (as with Abraham, Moses, and David) all contain a promise concerning the whole race of man. Hence the Gentiles (as the utterances of prophecy showed more and more clearly while the ages rolled on) were exiles from what should have been their home; and their call into the Church of Christ was a restoration of God's wandering children. In relation to (2) it is impossible not to observe, even in the highest forms of heathen philosophy, how their comparative "godlessness"--the absence of any clear notion of a real spiritual tie of nature between God and man--made their "hope" of life and immortality, though still cherished, shadowy and uncertain, always stronger in itself than in its grounds. But St. Paul's description ought to be applied strictly, not to heathen life in its nobler and purer forms, but to the heathen life of Asia Minor in his days. What that was in moral degradation and in loss of all spiritual religion, ill compensated by the inevitable proneness to various superstitions, all contemporary literature testifies. From it came, as the Romans declared, the corruption which overspread the whole empire, and which St. Paul describes so terribly in <a href="/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18-32</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That at that time ye were without Christ.</span> Very comprehensive description, having no knowledge of Christ, no interest in him, no life or blessing from him. <span class="cmt_word">Being aliens</span> (or, <span class="accented">alienated</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from the commonwealth of Israel</span>; the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or citizenship condition, including a country, a constitution, a divinely appointed and divinely administered economy, rich in blessing. <span class="cmt_word">And strangers to the covenants of the promise.</span> The promise of Christ, of which circumcision was the seal. The "covenants" (plural) substantially the same, but renewed to various persons and at various times in which God promised, "I will bless him that blesseth thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." In respect of these they were strangers, not embraced in their provisions, not, therefore, in a state of encouragement to expect a great blessing. <span class="cmt_word">Having no hope</span>; no ground for looking forward to better times, no reasonable expectation of improvement in your religious condition. <span class="cmt_word">And without God in the world</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, atheists; but not in the active sense of denying God, rather in the passive sense of unconnected with God; without any friendly and beneficial relation to him, without any vital nexus that would bring into their soul the fullness of God. The words "in the world" intensify "<span class="accented">without</span> God." It were bad enough to be without God (without his holy fellowship and blessed influence) anywhere, but it is worse to be without him <span class="accented">in the world</span>, in "this present evil world" (<a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>), in a world dominated by so subtle and evil a god (ver. 2 and <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). The fivefold negative description of this verse has a cumulative effect; the situation becomes graver and more terrible, and the last clause is the climax. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[remember] that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
