In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing the moral and spiritual darkness that characterized the lives of the Gentiles before they came to faith in Christ. The "light" here represents the truth of the Gospel and the holiness of God. When the light of Christ shines on sinful deeds, it reveals their true nature. This concept is echoed in <a href="/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20-21</a>, where those who do evil hate the light for fear their deeds will be exposed. The idea of light exposing darkness is also seen in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp to the feet and a light to the path, guiding believers away from sin.<p><b>for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a transformation that occurs when something is exposed to the light. Once illuminated, it not only becomes visible but also begins to reflect the light itself. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel in a believer's life. As Christians are exposed to the truth of Christ, they are called to reflect His light to the world, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are described as the light of the world. This transformation is a key aspect of sanctification, where believers grow in holiness and become more like Christ. The imagery of light transforming and spreading is also prophetic, pointing to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom, where darkness will be completely dispelled, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>, where the glory of God gives light to the New Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture, and the location of the church to which Paul addressed this letter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, this early Christian community faced challenges from both pagan influences and internal issues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/light.htm">Light</a></b><br>Symbolically represents truth, purity, and the presence of God, often contrasted with darkness, which symbolizes sin and ignorance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/darkness.htm">Darkness</a></b><br>Represents sin, ignorance, and separation from God, often used in contrast to light in biblical literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transformative_power_of_light.htm">The Transformative Power of Light</a></b><br>The light of Christ exposes and transforms darkness, revealing truth and righteousness.

Those who step into His light not only see clearly; they become beacons through whom that same light reaches others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.</span>--This should properly be rendered, <span class= "ital">But all things, when reproved, are illuminated by the light.</span> The translation "are made manifest" is indeed fully in accordance with the common usage of the word. But the whole context shows that St. Paul is here using it in what is indeed its more proper etymological sense, for "are illumined." For the mere "being made manifest" is implied in the "being reproved;" whereas he is certainly passing on here to a fresh idea, and, moreover, to one which will bear the inference of the last clause of the verse. To "reprove" after the Christian manner is to bring into the full light of Christ's truth; and the effect of this is not merely to reprove, but to illumine by the inherent power of the light. Exactly with the same distinction of sense St. John uses both words (<a href="/context/john/3-20.htm" title="For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.">John 3:20-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</span>--That this translation (suggested, perhaps, by the difficulty of the passage when rightly rendered) is nevertheless certainly wrong, is shown both by the usage of the original word and by the genius of the whole context. It should be, <span class= "ital">for everything which is illuminated is light.</span> St. Paul here explains still more clearly what he means by illumination. It implies the catching the light and reflecting it, so as to become a new source of light. It must be noted that the subject of the sentence is not "the works of darkness," but "all things" in general. Hence the whole process is described, with almost scientific accuracy, as three-fold. First, the things, or persons, are dragged out of darkness into light; then they are illuminated; lastly, they become light in themselves and to others. There are, no doubt, exceptions to this, the right and normal process, in the case of the utterly reprobate, who have lost all power of reflecting light, and are therefore dark still in the blaze of noon; but the next verse shows that St. Paul is not contemplating these; and even these may be beacons of warning to others. The whole metaphor is more and more striking to us as modern science enlarges our knowledge of the manifold effects of light, not only to illuminate, but to change and to vivify.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light.</span> As, for instance, when our Lord reproved the hypocrisy of the Pharisees - their practices had not seemed to the disciples very evil before, but when Christ threw on them the pure light of truth, they were made manifest in their true character - they appeared and they still appear, odious. A just reproof places evil in a light that shows its true character. <span class="cmt_word">For everything which is made manifest is light.</span> Literally, this is a truism; anything shone on is no longer dark, but light. The nearest approach to <span class="accented">this</span>, morally, is that light has a transforming power; when the light of the gospel shines on anything dark or evil, it transforms it into what is light or good. This is not uniformly true; all the light of heaven turned on hell would not make it morally light; but it is the general property and tendency of moral light to transform. The exhortation would thus mean - Use your light to reprove what is evil or dark, for not only will the true character of the evil thereby be made apparent, but your light will have a transforming power. But if this were the meaning, we should expect in the end of the verse, not <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, to denote this transformation. The rendering of A.V., giving to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> an active meaning ("whatsoever doth make manifest is light"), is rejected by most grammarians, as not being consistent with the usage of the word. The meaning which that rendering gives is this: "Light is the element which makes all clear." We should thus have in the latter clause a proposition, affirming as universal what in the former clause is affirmed of one particular case; "things reproved are made manifest by the light, for it is only light that makes things clear." The exhortation to reprove would thus be confirmed by the consideration that the only way of making immoral things appear in their proper character is to let in on them the light of the gospel. The great practical point is that <span class="accented">Christians ought to let in and diffuse the light</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">everything</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(panta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
