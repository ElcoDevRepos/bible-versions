In biblical context, "walk" often refers to one's conduct or way of life (e.g., <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, Enoch walked with God). Love, in this sense, is agape love, which is selfless, sacrificial, and unconditional. This command echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>, where He instructs His disciples to love one another as He has loved them. The call to walk in love is a reflection of the greatest commandments: to love God and love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-39</a>).<p><b>just as Christ loved us</b><br>This phrase sets the standard for Christian love, which is modeled after Christ's love for humanity. Christ's love is demonstrated through His incarnation, ministry, and ultimately His sacrificial death. The love of Christ is described as self-giving and redemptive, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, where God demonstrates His love for us through Christ's death while we were still sinners. This love is not based on merit but is a divine initiative.<p><b>and gave Himself up for us</b><br>Here, the focus is on the voluntary nature of Christ's sacrifice. The phrase "gave Himself up" indicates a willing and intentional act, aligning with <a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>, where Jesus states that He lays down His life of His own accord. This act of giving is central to the concept of atonement, where Christ's death serves as a substitutionary sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-7</a>.<p><b>as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God</b><br>This imagery draws from Old Testament sacrificial practices, where offerings were made to God as a pleasing aroma (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17</a>). The term "fragrant" signifies acceptance and satisfaction by God, indicating that Christ's sacrifice was perfect and complete. This connects to the typology of Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the sacrificial system, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>, where His offering is described as once for all. The sacrificial language underscores the costliness and holiness of Christ's act, which reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance and instruction to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located, known for its diverse culture and religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ.htm">Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in Christianity, whose sacrificial love is the model for Christian behavior.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The recipient of Christ's sacrificial offering, emphasizing the divine relationship and purpose of Christ's actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The original audience of the letter, a community of believers navigating their faith in a complex cultural environment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_sacrificial_love.htm">Understanding Sacrificial Love</a></b><br>Christ's love is characterized by selflessness and sacrifice.

There is a similar connection of idea in <a href="/context/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12-13</a>, "This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." The imitation of God is in free and natural beneficence; the imitation of Christ is in that power of showing mercy, which is bought by suffering and sacrifice. He not only "loved us," but "gave Himself for us."<p><span class= "bld">An offering and a sacrifice to God,--</span>The same words, "sacrifice and offering," are found in close connection in <a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm" title="Why when he comes into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering you would not, but a body have you prepared me:">Hebrews 10:5</a>, which is a quotation from <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a>. Comparing these with the Hebrew words which they represent, and looking also to the etymology of the Greek words themselves, we see that the word "offering" signifies simply a gift offered to God, and is applied especially, though not exclusively, to unbloody sacrifices; while the word "sacrifice" distinctly implies the shedding of blood. Each word, when used alone, has constantly a more general sense. Thus "offering" is used in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm" title="For by one offering he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-18.htm" title="Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.">Hebrews 10:18</a>, for the sacrifice on the cross; while "sacrifice," in <a href="/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>, is made to translate the word commonly rendered as "offering." But when placed in juxtaposition they must be held distinctive; and hence we may conclude that our Lord made Himself "an offering" in the perfect obedience of His great humility, "coming to do God's will" (according to the prophetic anticipation of <a href="/context/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7-8</a>), and gave Himself a "sacrifice," when He completed that offering by shedding His blood on the cross. Both are said to be offered "for us," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on our behalf. We have, therefore, here a complete summary--all the more striking and characteristic because incidental--of the doctrine of the Atonement. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And walk in love.</span> Taking up anew the exhortation of <a href="/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>. Let your ordinary life be spent in an atmosphere of love. Drink it in from heaven, as plants drink in the sunshine; radiate it forth from eyes and face; let hands and feet be active in the service; let looks, words, and acts all be steeped in it. <span class="cmt_word">Even as Christ also loved us.</span> The passing from the Father to the Son as our Example is not a new departure; for the Son reveals the Father, the Son's love is the counterpart of the Father's, made visible to us in the way most fitted to impress us. Though Christ's love, like his Father's, is eternal, the aorist is used, to denote that specific act of love which is immediately in view. <span class="cmt_word">And gave himself for us.</span> The Pauline phrase (<a href="/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), simple, but very comprehensive: "himself" - all that he was as God, all that he became as Man, a complete self-surrender, a whole burnt offering. "For us," not merely on our behalf, but in our room (after verbs of giving, dying, etc.); this, indeed, being implied in the idea immediately following of a <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, which, alike to the Jewish and pagan mind, conveyed the idea of a life given in room of another. <span class="cmt_word">An offering and a sacrifice to God.</span> Offering and sacrifice are nearly synonymous, but the first probably includes the whole earthly career of Christ incarnate - his holy life, blessed example, gracious teaching, loving companionship, as well as his atoning death, which last is more precisely the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, sacrifice. The offering and sacrifice were presented to God, to satisfy his justice, fulfill the demands of his law, and glorify his holy and righteous government. <span class="cmt_word">For a sweet-smelling savor.</span> Allusion to Noah's sacrifice of every clean beast and of every fowl - " the Lord smelled a sweet savor;" that is, the whole transaction, not the offering merely, but the spirit in which it was offered likewise, was grateful to God. The whole work of Christ, and the beautiful spirit in which he offered himself, were grateful to the Father, and procure saving blessings for all who by faith make the offering their own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">walk</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(peripateite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4043.htm">Strong's 4043: </a> </span><span class="str2">From peri and pateo; to tread all around, i.e. Walk at large; figuratively, to live, deport oneself, follow.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
