It reflects the shared human condition of sinfulness before coming to faith in Christ. This aligns with <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The phrase "lived among them" suggests a past lifestyle that was indistinguishable from those who are not in Christ, highlighting the transformation that occurs through salvation.<p><b>fulfilling the cravings of our flesh</b><br>The "cravings of our flesh" refers to the sinful nature and desires that are inherent in humanity. This concept is rooted in the idea of original sin, which suggests that all humans are born with a propensity to sin due to the fall of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3). The "flesh" in biblical terms often denotes the sinful nature as opposed to the spiritual nature. <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a> lists the acts of the flesh, contrasting them with the fruit of the Spirit, illustrating the conflict between the two.<p><b>and indulging its desires and thoughts</b><br>This phrase indicates not only the actions but also the internal motivations and thoughts that are contrary to God's will. It underscores the comprehensive nature of sin, affecting both external behaviors and internal attitudes. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> explains how desire leads to sin, and sin, when fully grown, leads to death. This highlights the need for a transformation of the mind, as urged in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, to align with God's will.<p><b>Like the rest, we were by nature children of wrath</b><br>"Like the rest" reiterates the commonality of this condition among all people, emphasizing that no one is exempt from the consequences of sin. "By nature children of wrath" suggests that humanity, in its natural state, is subject to God's righteous judgment. This is consistent with <a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>, which states that those who do not believe in the Son remain under God's wrath.

It is indeed the great object of this chapter to bring out the equality and unity of both Jews and Gentiles in the Church of Christ; and this truth is naturally introduced by a statement of their former equality in alienation and sin.<p><span class= "bld">In the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</span>--The parallelism of these two clauses illustrates very clearly the extended sense in which the word "flesh" is used by St. Paul, as may indeed be seen by the catalogue of the works of the flesh in <a href="/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19-20</a>. For here "the flesh," in the first clause, includes both "the flesh and the mind" (or, more properly, the <span class= "ital">thoughts</span>) of the second; that is, it includes both the appetites and the passions of our fleshly nature, and also the "thoughts" of the mind itself, so far as it is devoted to this visible world of sense, alienated from God, and therefore under the influence of the powers of evil. In fact, in scriptural use the sins of "the flesh," "the world," and "the devil" are not different classes of sins, but different aspects of sin, and any one of the three great enemies is made at times to represent all.<p><span class= "bld">And were by nature the children of wrath, even as others</span> (or rather, <span class= "ital">the others--</span>that is, the heathen).--From this passage the phrase "children of wrath" has passed into Christian theology as an almost technical description of the unregenerate state. Hence it needs careful examination. (1) Now the phrase "children of wrath" (corresponding almost exactly to "children of a curse," in <a href="/2_peter/2-14.htm" title="Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:">2Peter 2:14</a>) seems borrowed from the Hebrew use in the Old Testament, by which (as in <a href="/1_samuel/20-30.htm" title="Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother's nakedness?">1Samuel 20:30</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm" title="And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD lives, the man that has done this thing shall surely die:">2Samuel 12:5</a>) a "son of death" is one under sentence of death, and in <a href="/isaiah/57-4.htm" title="Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood.">Isaiah 57:4</a> (the Greek translation) "children of destruction" are those doomed to perish. In this sense we have, in <a href="/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>, "the son of perdition;" and in <a href="/matthew/23-15.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.">Matthew 23:15</a>, "the son of hell." It differs, therefore, considerably from the phrase "children of disobedience" (begotten, as it were, of disobedience) above. But it is notable that the word for "children" here used is a term expressing endearment and love, and is accordingly properly, and almost invariably, applied to our relation to God. When, therefore, it is used as in this passage, or, still more strikingly, in <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1John 3:10</a>, "children of the devil" (comp. <a href="/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>), there is clearly an intention to arrest the attention by a startling and paradoxical expression. "We were children," not of God, not of His love, but "of wrath"--that is, His wrath against sin; "born (see <a href="/context/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10-22</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>) under the law," and therefore "shut up under sin," and "under the curse." (2) Next, we have the phrase "by nature," which, in the true reading of the original, is interposed, as a kind of limitation or definition, between "children" and "of wrath." In the first instance it was probably suggested by the reference to Israel, who were by covenant, not by nature, the chosen people of God. Now the word "nature," applied to humanity, indicates what is common to all, as opposed to what is individual, or what is inborn, as opposed to what is acquired. But whether it refers to humanity as it was created by God, or to humanity as it has become by "fault and corruption of nature," must always be determined by the context. Here the reference is clearly to the latter. "Nature" is opposed to "grace"--that is, the nature of man as alienated from God, to the nature of man as restored to his original birthright, the "image of God," in Jesus Christ. (See <a href="/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12-21</a>.) The existence of an inborn sinfulness needs no revelation to make it evident to those who have eyes to see. It needs a revelation--and such a revelation the gospel gives--to declare to us that it is not man's true nature, and that what is really original is not sin, but righteousness. (3) The whole passage, therefore, describes the state of men before their call to union with Christ, as naturally "under wrath," and is well illustrated by the full description, in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>; <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, of those on whom "the wrath of God is revealed." There man's state is depicted as having still some knowledge of God (<a href="/context/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19-21</a>), as having "the work of the law written on the heart" (<a href="/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>), and accordingly as being still under a probation before God (<a href="/context/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6-11</a>). Elsewhere we learn that Christ, "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," died for all, even "the ungodly" (<a href="/context/romans/5-6.htm" title="For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm" title="And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.">Revelation 13:1</a>); and that none are wholly excluded from His atonement but those who "tread under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing" (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>). Hence that state is not absolutely lost or hopeless. But yet, when the comparison, as here, is with the salvation of the gospel, they are declared "children of wrath" who are "strangers to the new covenant of promise," with its two supernatural gifts of justification by faith and sanctification in the Spirit, and their condition is described, comparatively but not absolutely, as "having no hope, and without God in the world." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Among whom we also all once spent our life in the lusts of our flesh.</span> The apostle here brings Jews and Gentiles together. "We also," as well as you - we were all in the same condemnation, all in a miserable plight, not merely occasionally dipping into sin, but spending our very lives in the lusts or desires of our flesh, living fro' no noble ends, but in an element of carnal desire, as if there were nothing higher than to please the carnal nature. <span class="cmt_word">Fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</span> Desires of the flesh, the grosser and more animal propensities (the flesh, in Scripture, has often a wider sense; see <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>); and of the mind or thoughts, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the objects that we thought about, whatever they might be, - the <span class="accented">waywardness</span> of our thoughts seems to be denoted, the random roaming of the mind hither and thither, towards this pleasure and that, sometimes serious, sometimes frivolous, but all marked by the absence of any controlling regard to the will of God. The life indicated is a life of indulgence in whatever natural feelings may arise in us-be they right or be they wrong. <span class="cmt_word">And we were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.</span> This is a substantive clause, standing on its own basis, a separate fact, not merely an inference from the previous statements. The <span class="accented">life</span> described would have exposed us to wrath; but beyond and before this we were <span class="accented">by nature</span> children of wrath. "By nature" denotes something in our constitution, in our very being; and "even as the rest" denotes that this was universal, not a peculiarity affecting some, but a general feature applicable to all. "Children of wrath" denotes that we belonged to a race which had incurred the wrath of God; our individuality was so far absorbed by the social body that we shared the lot under which it had come. If there be something in this that seems contrary to justice, that seems to condemn men for the sins of others, we remark <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that in actual life we constantly find individuals suffering for the sin of the corporation, domestic, social, or national, with which they are identified; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that apart from this altogether, our individual offenses would expose us to God's wrath; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the moral and legal relations of the individual to the corporation is a subject of difficulty, and in this case makes a strong demand on our faith. We should accept the teaching of the Word of God upon it, and leave our righteous Judge to vindicate himself. "Wrath," as applied to God, must be regarded as essentially different from the same word when used of man. In the latter case it usually indicates a disorderly, excited, passionate feeling, as of one who has lost self-control; when used of God, it denotes the holy, calm, deep opposition of his nature to sin, compelling him to inflict the appropriate punishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">We</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;meis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
