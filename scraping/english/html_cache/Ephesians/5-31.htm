It echoes <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, establishing the divine origin of marriage. The "reason" is rooted in God's design for unity and partnership, reflecting the spiritual union between Christ and believers.<p><b>a man will leave his father and mother</b><br>In ancient Jewish culture, family ties were strong, and leaving one's parents signified a significant shift in loyalty and responsibility. This departure underscores the establishment of a new, primary family unit. It also highlights the importance of prioritizing the marital relationship over previous familial bonds, a principle that transcends cultural boundaries.<p><b>and be united to his wife</b><br>The term "united" implies a deep, covenantal bond, not merely a physical or emotional connection. This unity is a lifelong commitment, reflecting the covenant relationship God has with His people. The Hebrew word for "united" in Genesis is "dabaq," which conveys the idea of clinging or adhering firmly, emphasizing the permanence and exclusivity of marriage.<p><b>and the two will become one flesh</b><br>This phrase signifies the complete union of husband and wife, encompassing physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. It points to the mystery of marriage as a reflection of the unity between Christ and the Church. The concept of "one flesh" also has implications for sexual ethics, underscoring the sanctity and exclusivity of the marital relationship. This unity is a type of the mystical union believers have with Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance and teaching to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located, known for its diverse culture and religious practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam_and_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a></b><br>The first man and woman, whose union is referenced in this verse, originally found in Genesis.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The institution being discussed, symbolizing the union between a man and a woman.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_and_the_church.htm">Christ and the Church</a></b><br>The ultimate example of unity and love, which marriage is meant to reflect.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_design_of_marriage.htm">The Divine Design of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is instituted by God as a sacred union, reflecting His design and purpose for human relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leaving_and_cleaving.htm">Leaving and Cleaving</a></b><br>The call to leave one's parents signifies the establishment of a new, primary family unit, emphasizing commitment and independence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_marriage.htm">Unity in Marriage</a></b><br>Becoming "one flesh" signifies a deep, holistic union that encompasses physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ_and_the_church.htm">Reflecting Christ and the Church</a></b><br>Christian marriages are called to mirror the love, sacrifice, and unity between Christ and His Church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_and_covenant.htm">Commitment and Covenant</a></b><br>Marriage is a covenantal relationship that requires ongoing commitment, love, and mutual respect.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_5_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 5:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_5_31_on_marriage_definition.htm">How does Ephesians 5:31 define the marriage relationship between husband and wife?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_leave_parents_mean_today.htm">What does "leave his father and mother" imply for marital priorities today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_24_Ephesians_5_31_link.htm">How does Genesis 2:24 connect with Ephesians 5:31 on marital unity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_couples_unite_spiritually_emotionally.htm">In what ways can couples become "one flesh" spiritually and emotionally?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_5_31_s_role_in_marital_peace.htm">How can Ephesians 5:31 guide Christian couples in resolving marital conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_5_31_on_biblical_marriage.htm">How does Ephesians 5:31 define the concept of marriage in a biblical context?

His bones" as parenthetical, and refer back to <a href="/context/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.">Ephesians 5:28-29</a>. In exactly the same way our Lord quotes the same verse of Genesis (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm" title="Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall join to his wife: and they shall be one flesh.">Genesis 2:24</a>) to show the indissoluble character of the marriage tie. Here the similarity of connection with that of the original passage is even stronger. Because a man's wife is as his own body, "for this cause shall a man," &c. To connect these words with those going before is indeed possible, but somewhat too mystical even for this passage.<p><span class= "bld">Shall a man leave his father . . .</span>--The relation of parentage is one of common flesh and blood, and stands at the head of those natural relations which we do not make, but into which we are born. The relation of marriage is the most sacred of all the ties into which we are not born, and which we do make for ourselves, in accordance with a true or supposed harmony of nature. It becomes, says Holy Scripture, a relation, not of common flesh and blood, but of "one flesh." Itself originally voluntary, it supersedes all natural ties. Our Lord therefore adds, "They are no more twain, but one flesh. What God hath joined together let not man put asunder" (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm" title="Why they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.">Matthew 19:6</a>). Hence it strikingly represents that unity with Christ--voluntarily initiated by Him, voluntarily accepted by us--which yet so supersedes all natural ties that it is said to oblige a man to "hate his father and mother . . . and his own life also" (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall come to be one flesh.</span> Quoted in substance from <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>. It seems to be introduced simply to show the closeness of the relation between man and wife; it is such as in a sense to supersede that between parent and child.
