Stealing was a common issue in the ancient world, often driven by poverty or greed. The command to cease stealing reflects the moral and ethical standards of the new Christian life. This aligns with the Eighth Commandment, "You shall not steal" (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>), emphasizing a return to God's law. The call to stop stealing is a call to repentance and a change of heart, which is a central theme in the New Testament (<a href="/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>).<p><b>but must work</b><br>Work is presented as a divine ordinance, established in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a> when God placed Adam in the Garden of Eden to work it. The emphasis on work here underscores the dignity and responsibility of labor. In the Greco-Roman world, manual labor was often looked down upon, but Christianity elevated the value of honest work. This reflects the teaching of <a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>, "All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty."<p><b>doing good with his own hands</b><br>This phrase highlights the virtue of self-sufficiency and the importance of contributing positively to society. The use of "his own hands" suggests personal responsibility and integrity in one's labor. This is reminiscent of Paul's own example, as he often worked as a tentmaker to support himself (<a href="/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>). The emphasis on "doing good" aligns with the broader biblical teaching that work should not only provide for oneself but also serve others (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<p><b>that he may have something to share with the one in need</b><br>The ultimate purpose of work, according to this passage, is not merely self-sustenance but generosity. This reflects the Christian principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/mark/12-31.htm">Mark 12:31</a>) and the early church's practice of sharing resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). The call to share with those in need echoes the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the poor and needy (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>). This principle of generosity is a reflection of God's own nature, who provides abundantly for His creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance to the early Christian church on how to live a life worthy of their calling.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

Christ calls the former thief to stop stealing, embrace honest work, and use the fruit of that work to bless others. In doing so, the believer mirrors God&#8217;s own giving nature, turning hands once used to take into hands eager to serve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Let him that stole</span> (properly, <span class= "ital">the stealer</span>) <span class= "bld">steal</span> <span class= "bld">no more. . . .</span>--In this verse St. Paul treats dishonesty, virtually, although less distinctly, from the same point of view as before. For he is not content with forbidding it, or even with forbidding it as fatal to society; but he directs that it be superseded by the opposite spirit of self-sacrifice, working in order to give to others what is honestly our own, as the fruit of the labour of "our own hands." In that direction there is a profound wisdom, in striking at the root of that exclusive selfishness which so often and so naturally exhibits itself in dishonesty. But we note in it also a peculiar harmony with the great doctrine of unity; for the sense of unity will always exhibit itself in working what is "good," that is, <span class= "ital">gracious, </span>for the sake of "him that needs."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the stealer stem no more</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may be translated either as a noun or as the present participle. In either case it implies that even Christians might continue to steal, and that they had to be warned against the habit. This may seem strange to us, but not to those who consider how little theft was thought of among the pagans, and how liable such habits are to remain among converts from heathenism. Where there is a low moral tone and an uneducated conscience, very great irregularities may be found. Dishonesty in trade, deceit in business, are just the same. Among the Ephesians, thieving was probably the result of idle habits and of dislike to hard work. Hence the apostle says, But rather let him labor, working with his hands the things that are good, that he may have to impart to him that hath need. Idleness is mean, labor is honorable; Christ calls us to work, not for this reason only, but in order that we may have something to give away. Paganism would rob others of what is rightfully their own; Christianity leads me to give to others what is rightfully my own. This different genius of the two systems appears here very clearly. Observe the true use of superfluities - look out for the needy, and give for their relief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
