Tychicus is mentioned in other parts of the New Testament (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>, <a href="/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>) as a faithful servant and messenger. The act of sending a representative was common in the early church, as it was a practical way to maintain communication and provide support to distant congregations. This reflects the importance of personal relationships and accountability within the body of Christ.<p><b>that you may know about us</b><br>Paul emphasizes transparency and openness in his ministry. By sending Tychicus, he ensures that the Ephesians are informed about his circumstances and the progress of the gospel. This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of the early Christian communities and their shared concern for one another. It also underscores the importance of mutual support and prayer, as knowing about Paul's situation would enable the Ephesians to pray more effectively for him.<p><b>and that he may encourage your hearts</b><br>Encouragement is a central theme in Paul's letters, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a>. The early church faced persecution and challenges, making encouragement vital for sustaining faith and perseverance. Tychicus's role was not only to deliver news but also to uplift and strengthen the believers in Ephesus. This reflects the pastoral care and concern that Paul had for the churches, as well as the role of fellow believers in edifying one another. Encouragement is a spiritual gift and a necessary component of Christian fellowship, as it helps believers remain steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing from prison to encourage and instruct the church in Ephesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tychicus.htm">Tychicus</a></b><br>A beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, Tychicus is the one sent by Paul to deliver the letter and provide encouragement to the Ephesians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of early Christianity and the recipient of this epistle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The community of believers in Ephesus who are the primary audience of this letter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul's_imprisonment.htm">Paul's Imprisonment</a></b><br>The context from which Paul writes, highlighting his dedication to the Gospel despite his circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_encouragement_in_the_church.htm">The Importance of Encouragement in the Church</a></b><br>Encouragement is a vital ministry within the church, as demonstrated by Tychicus's role.

The words "that he might comfort (or, <span class= "ital">encourage</span>) your hearts," although they might apply generally to all messengers from an Apostle, may probably be best explained by reference to the tone of the Epistle to the Philippians--in which St. Paul shows so much affectionate anxiety lest his converts should be disheartened by his continued imprisonment--and to the exhortation in this Epistle not "to faint at his tribulations for them" (<a href="/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.</span> This serves to explain the absence of personal remembrances, allusions, and messages in the Epistle. Tychicus, who had his full confidence, would tell them all by word of mouth. The concluding words show that it was not to gratify any mere personal feeling that Paul directed Tychicus to make this communication; but knowing how much they felt for him, he believed it would be a comfort to hear how he fared. To pagans the idea of captivity was always dolorous and dreadful; it was well for them to learn how Christians could glory in tribulations (<a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>). Tychicus, the beloved brother, was evidently well fitted to apply to the Ephesians this comforting view of his state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/6-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I have sent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#956;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(epempsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3992.htm">Strong's 3992: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send, transmit, permit to go, put forth. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[him]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4314.htm">Strong's 4314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To, towards, with.
