This love is agape, a selfless, unconditional love that seeks the best for others. In the biblical context, God's love is a recurring theme, seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, where God's love leads to the giving of His Son for the salvation of the world. The Old Testament also reflects this love, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>, where God chooses Israel not because of their merits but because of His love and faithfulness to His promises. This love is foundational to the Christian faith, underscoring the relationship between God and His people.<p><b>God, who is rich in mercy</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to God's character, particularly His mercy. Mercy, in this context, refers to God's compassion and forgiveness towards humanity, despite their sinfulness. The richness of His mercy indicates an abundance, suggesting that God's mercy is inexhaustible and freely given. This is consistent with the portrayal of God throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>, which describes God as "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love." The concept of God's mercy is also evident in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, where salvation is attributed to God's mercy rather than human deeds. This mercy is a key aspect of the gospel message, highlighting God's willingness to forgive and restore those who turn to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as rich in mercy and motivated by great love for humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to the Ephesians, addressing the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, where the early Christian church was established and to whom this letter was addressed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The body of believers in Ephesus and, by extension, all Christians who are recipients of God's love and mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>While not mentioned directly in this verse, He is the embodiment of God's love and mercy, central to the context of <a href="/bsb/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_nature.htm">Understanding God's Nature</a></b><br>Recognize that God's actions are motivated by His intrinsic nature of love and mercy.

The idea of richness in grace, glory, mercy, is especially frequent in this Epistle. (See <a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm" title="In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For his great</span> <span class= "bld">love.</span>--Again, as in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>, stress is laid on the love of God, before all else, as the one moving cause of salvation. (Comp. <a href="/romans/5-8.htm" title="But God commends his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.">Romans 5:8</a>, "God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But God, being rich in mercy.</span> The preceding verses convey the idea of a rushing towards inevitable ruin - towards some frightful cataract, when all help from man is hopeless. Man's extremity becomes God's opportunity. The "but" is very emphatic, and wonderfully reverses the picture. The sovereignty of God is very apparent, on its gracious side. It interposes to rescue those who would otherwise plunge into irretrievable ruin. We have here the filling up of that Divine saying, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thine help." The genesis of salvation is declared to be in two of God's attributes, of which the first is mercy, or compassion. God has a tender, yearning feeling towards men brought to misery by their own sins. And this feeling is not shallow or spare - he is rich in mercy. It is an exuberant, full-flowing feeling in God ("Thy mercy ... is in the heavens," <a href="/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>), and may therefore be appealed to trustfully. <span class="cmt_word">For his great love wherewith he loved us.</span> The other attribute from which the plan of salvation sprang is God's love. Love is more than compassion. Compassion may be confined to the breast, but love goes forth in active beneficence. It makes common cause with its object. It cannot rest till its object is lint right. Two expressions are used intensifying this Divine love: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> his great love; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> love with which he loved us; <p>the verb of love governing the noun of love makes the idea rich and strong. This view of the exuberance of the Divine attributes from which salvation has its rise is in harmony with the whole character of the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
