In the early church, oral tradition was a primary means of spreading the Gospel. <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> states, "Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ." The Ephesians, like many early Christians, would have heard about Jesus through apostles and evangelists. This hearing is not just physical but involves understanding and accepting the message of salvation.<p><b>and were taught in Him</b><br>Being "taught in Him" suggests a deeper, ongoing process of discipleship and learning. This teaching is not merely academic but transformative, as it involves being instructed in the ways of Christ. In the context of Ephesians, Paul often emphasizes the role of the church in teaching and edifying believers (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>). The phrase also implies a personal relationship with Christ, as believers are taught "in Him," indicating that Jesus Himself is the source and subject of this teaching.<p><b>in keeping with the truth that is in Jesus</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the centrality of truth in the Christian life. Jesus is described as "the way, the truth, and the life" in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, underscoring that truth is not just a concept but personified in Christ. The truth in Jesus contrasts with the deceit and falsehood prevalent in the world. In <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, Paul warns against being "tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching." The truth in Jesus provides a firm foundation for believers, guiding them in righteousness and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to instruct and encourage them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its diverse culture and the Temple of Artemis.

By a loving study and knowledge of His person, as set forth to us in the gospel, and brought home to us by His grace, rather than by abstract musing on the office and attributes of "the Christ," we come to learn the Christ also. The use of the simple name Jesus, so common in the Gospels, is rare indeed in the Epistles, where we constantly find the fuller description "Jesus Christ," "the Lord Jesus," "Jesus the Son of God." Wherever it occurs, it will be found to be distinctive or emphatic. This distinctiveness is most strikingly evident in <a href="/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a> : "If the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up [the] Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies." The "raising up of Jesus," is the historical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth; the "raising up the Christ" points to the mysterious effect of that resurrection on those for whom He is the Mediator. Of the few other passages in which the simple name occurs, some (as <a href="/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm" title="By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.">Hebrews 10:10</a>) are mere reiterations of the name occurring above with the due title of honour; others are quasi-recitals of a creed declaring the historic Jesus (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>; comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-4.htm" title="For if he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if you receive another spirit, which you have not received, or another gospel, which you have not accepted, you might well bear with him.">2Corinthians 11:4</a>). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, where, in accordance with one main purpose of the Epistle, this usage is least rare (see <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm" title="Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 6:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-22.htm" title="By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.">Hebrews 7:22</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>), it will be found that in all cases, either special stress is laid on the lowly and suffering humanity of the Lord, or the historic facts of His ministry on earth are referred to. The modern familiarity of use of the simple name "Jesus" has little authority in apostolic usage. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If so be that ye heard him.</span> A word of caution.

Truth apart from the person of Christ has little power; abstract doctrines have little influence; the very atonement may be a barren dogma. But the atonement taught "in Jesus," in connection with the living, loving, dying, risen Savior tells; the blood of redemption in connection with the Son of God incarnate thus loving us, and meekly, patiently suffering the agonies of the cross in our room, is not only a power, but the greatest moral power that can move the heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7988;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
