In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing both Jews and Gentiles, highlighting that it is through Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection that all people can approach God. This aligns with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus states, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." The concept of Jesus as the mediator is also seen in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, which underscores His unique role in bridging the gap caused by sin.<p><b>we both have access</b><br>The "we both" refers to Jews and Gentiles, emphasizing the unity and equality of all believers in Christ. This was a radical concept in the first-century context, where Jews and Gentiles were often divided by cultural and religious barriers. The term "access" suggests a direct approach to God, which was previously restricted under the Old Covenant, where only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year. <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a> elaborates on this newfound access, encouraging believers to draw near to God with confidence.<p><b>to the Father</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate relationship believers can have with God, who is portrayed as a loving Father. In the Greco-Roman world, the concept of God as a father was not common, making this a distinctive feature of Christian theology. The fatherhood of God is a recurring theme in the New Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, where believers are described as receiving the Spirit of adoption, allowing them to cry out, "Abba, Father."<p><b>by one Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit is the agent through whom believers experience this access to the Father. The unity of the Spirit is a key theme in Ephesians, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, which speaks of one body and one Spirit. The Spirit's role in uniting believers is also evident in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>, where Paul writes about all being baptized by one Spirit into one body. The Spirit's work in the life of believers is transformative, enabling them to live in accordance with God's will and to experience the fullness of their relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesians.htm">Ephesians</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the Ephesians were members of the early Christian church in Ephesus, a major city in Asia Minor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "Him" in the verse, Jesus is the central figure through whom believers have access to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, to whom believers have access.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_spirit.htm">The Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, who facilitates believers' access to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_christ.htm">Unity in Christ</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes that both Jews and Gentiles have equal access to God through Jesus, promoting unity among believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_trinity.htm">Role of the Trinity</a></b><br>This passage highlights the cooperative work of the Trinity in the believer's life, with Jesus providing access and the Spirit facilitating it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/access_to_god.htm">Access to God</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to approach God with confidence, knowing that access is granted through Jesus and empowered by the Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_intimacy.htm">Spiritual Intimacy</a></b><br>The verse invites believers to cultivate a deeper relationship with God, made possible through the Spirit's work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_worship.htm">Prayer and Worship</a></b><br>Understanding our access to the Father should transform our prayer life and worship, encouraging us to draw near with reverence and boldness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_2_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 2:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ephesians_2_18_Unity_via_Holy_Spirit.htm">How does Ephesians 2:18 emphasize unity among believers through the Holy Spirit?

This truth invites confident fellowship with God and unbreakable unity with one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.</span>--In this verse the two meanings again unite. In the original the order is emphatic: "Through Him we have the access, both of us in one Spirit, to the Father." The greater idea of access to God is still prominent; but the lesser idea of union with each other in that access is still traceable as an undertone. "Access" is properly "the introduction" (used also in <a href="/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>), a technical word of presentation to a royal presence. So says Chrysostom, "We came not of ourselves, but He brought us in." The corresponding verb is found in <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>, "Christ also suffered for sins--the just for the unjust--that He might <span class= "ital">bring us to God."</span> It will be noted that we have here one of the implicit declarations of the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, so frequent in this Epistle. The unity of the whole Church, as united "to the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Spirit," is here summed up in one sentence, but with as much perfection and clearness as even when it is unfolded in the great passage below (<a href="/context/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>). The ultimate source of all doctrine on the subject is necessarily in the words of the Lord Himself. (See John 14-17, especially <a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/context/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16-18</a>; <a href="/context/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23-25</a>; <a href="/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="/context/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13-15</a>; <a href="/context/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20-21</a>.) For these are the "heavenly things"; and "no man hath ascended into heaven but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man who is in heaven" (<a href="/context/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12-13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For through him both of us have our access by one Spirit unto the Father.</span> Further illustration of identity of position of Jews and Gentiles, and of the work of Christ in bringing it about. Subject of this verse, access to the Father; predicate, this access effected through Christ by the one Spirit. Our having access to the Father is assumed as a matter of spiritual experience; the converted Ephesians knew that in their prayers and other exercises they did really stand before God, and felt as children to a Father. How came this to pass? "Through him." Sinful men have not this privilege by nature; "Your iniquities have <span class="accented">separated</span> between you and your God" (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). They need a Mediator; Jesus is that Mediator; and through him, both Jews and Gentiles enjoy the privilege. But right of access is not enough; in approaching God and holding fellowship with him there must be some congeniality of soul, a fellow-feeling between God and the worshipper; this is effected through the same Spirit. Some render "in the same spirit, or disposition of mind." This is true, but not all the truth; for the question arises - How do we get this suitable disposition? And the answer is - It is wrought by the Holy Spirit. As the state of the soul in true intercourse with God is substantially the same in all, so it is brought by the same Holy Spirit. In fact, this verse is one of the characteristic texts of Ephesians, in which Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are brought together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
