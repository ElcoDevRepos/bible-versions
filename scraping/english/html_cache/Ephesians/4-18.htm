In biblical context, darkness often symbolizes ignorance and separation from God (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). The understanding here refers to the mind's ability to perceive spiritual realities. This darkening is a result of sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, where people, although knowing God, did not honor Him, leading to futile thinking and darkened hearts.<p><b>and alienated from the life of God</b><br>Alienation from God indicates a separation from His presence and the spiritual life He offers. This echoes the condition of humanity after the Fall, as described in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where sin caused a rift between God and man. The life of God refers to the eternal life and fellowship with Him, which is restored through Christ (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a> also speaks of being "separate from Christ" and "without hope."<p><b>because of the ignorance that is in them</b><br>Ignorance here is not merely a lack of knowledge but a willful rejection of God's truth. This ignorance is a spiritual condition, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. It is a deliberate turning away from God, leading to moral and spiritual decay.<p><b>due to the hardness of their hearts</b><br>The hardness of heart is a biblical metaphor for stubbornness and resistance to God's will. This condition is often self-imposed, as seen in Pharaoh's hardened heart in <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-11</a>. It signifies an unwillingness to repent and accept God's truth. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of the hardness of heart as a barrier to understanding His teachings (<a href="/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>).

They are "darkened in the understanding," and so, "by the ignorance in them alienated from the life of God." The phrase "the life of God" is unique. It may, however, be interpreted by a similar phrase, the "righteousness of God" (<a href="/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the righteousness given by God. What the life given by God is, we know by our Lord's own words (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>), "This is the life eternal, to know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou has sent." So far as the understanding is concerned, this alienation signifies the loss of the central light of Truth in God, and with it the loss, partial or complete, of the vision of other truths in their right proportion and harmony.<p>But the second result is moral. St. Paul attributes the alienation from God, or (possibly, though less probably) "the ignorance which is in them," to <span class= "ital">the hardness of their heart--</span>for the marginal reading is correct; the word used signifies, almost technically, "callousness" and insensibility. To make his meaning clearer still he adds, "who (or, <span class= "ital">inasmuch as they</span>) being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness." There is precisely a similar current of thought (noting, however, the characteristic difference referred to above) in <a href="/context/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24-32</a>, where St. Paul draws out, as consequences of the same vanity, first lusts of uncleanness, next unnatural sin, and at last breaks out into a fearful enumeration of the signs of the reprobate mind. On this side, therefore, "the alienation from the life of God" is the loss of the grace by which He dwells in the soul, and by indwelling gives it the moral and spiritual life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being darkened in their understanding</span> (second point of difference), and thus blind to all that is most vital - ignorant of God, of the way of salvation, of the love of Christ. Even at best the natural understanding cannot discover these things, and when it is not only imperfect but darkened - made more obscure than ever by sin (see after) - its guidance is altogether defective. It has been said truly that the youngest scholar in a Sunday school that has been taught the elements of the gospel has more light than the wisest of the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart</span> (third point of difference).
