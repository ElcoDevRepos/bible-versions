This metaphor emphasizes the intimate and organic connection between Christ and believers. In the cultural context of the first century, the body was often used as a metaphor for unity and diversity within a community. Paul uses this imagery to illustrate how each member of the Church has a unique role, yet all are united under Christ as the head (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This concept is foundational for understanding the Church's identity and mission, as it highlights the interdependence of believers and their collective purpose in representing Christ on earth.<p><b>the fullness of Him</b><br>"The fullness of Him" suggests that the Church is the means through which Christ's presence and power are manifested in the world. This phrase can be connected to the idea of the Church being the vessel through which God's purposes are fulfilled. In <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>, Paul writes that "God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Him," referring to Christ. The Church, as His body, is thus the extension of Christ's fullness, tasked with continuing His work and embodying His character. This fullness implies completeness and the idea that the Church is equipped with all it needs to fulfill its divine mission.<p><b>who fills all in all</b><br>"Who fills all in all" speaks to Christ's sovereign authority and His ability to permeate every aspect of creation. This phrase underscores the omnipresence and omnipotence of Christ, who is not limited by time or space. It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the earth is described as being full of God's glory. In the New Testament, this concept is further developed in passages like <a href="/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>, where Christ is described as being "all, and in all." This phrase assures believers of Christ's active involvement in the world and His ultimate plan to reconcile all things to Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_ephesus.htm">The Church in Ephesus</a></b><br>The recipients of the letter, the church in Ephesus was a significant early Christian community located in a major city of the Roman province of Asia.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Referred to as "Him" in the verse, Jesus is central to the passage as the one who fills all in all and whose body is the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_as_christ's_body.htm">The Church as Christ's Body</a></b><br>The church is not just an organization but a living organism, the body of Christ, called to represent Him on earth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fullness_of_christ.htm">The Fullness of Christ</a></b><br>Christ fills the church with His presence and power, enabling believers to live out their faith effectively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_diversity_in_the_body.htm">Unity and Diversity in the Body</a></b><br>Just as a body has many parts, each with a unique role, so does the church.

The word itself is derived from a verb signifying, first, to "fill;" next (more frequently in the New Testament), to "fulfil" or <span class= "ital">complete.</span> It is found (1) in a physical sense of the "full contents" of the baskets, in <a href="/mark/6-43.htm" title="And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.">Mark 6:43</a>; <a href="/mark/8-20.htm" title="And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? And they said, Seven.">Mark 8:20</a>; and of the earth, in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/10-26.htm" title="For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.">1Corinthians 10:26-28</a>; and in <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>, <a href="/mark/2-21.htm" title="No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.">Mark 2:21</a>, it is applied to the patch of new cloth on an old garment. It is used next (2) of fulness, in sense of the "complete tale or number," "of time" and "seasons," in <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>, <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>; of the Jews and Gentiles in <a href="/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>; <a href="/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>. In the third place (3) it is applied to the full essence, including all the attributes, of a thing or person; as of the Law (<a href="/romans/13-10.htm" title="Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.">Romans 13:10</a>), and of the blessing of Christ (<a href="/romans/15-29.htm" title="And I am sure that, when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:29</a>). Lastly (4), in these Epistles it is applied, almost technically, to the fulness of the Divine Nature. Thus, in <a href="/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a> we have, "It pleased the Father that in Christ all the fulness"--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, all the fulness of the Divine Nature--"should dwell;" or (to take an admissible but less probable construction) "In Him all the fulness is pleased to dwell;" and this is explained in <a href="/ephesians/2-9.htm" title="Not of works, lest any man should boast.">Ephesians 2:9</a>, "In Him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." Similarly, though less strikingly, we read in this Epistle, that those who are in Christ are said (in <a href="/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>) "to be filled up to all the fulness of God," and "to come to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. In which of these last senses is the Church here said to be the "fulness of Christ?" If in any, probably in the last of all. As the individual, so the Church, by the presence "of Him who filleth up all things for Himself in all," comes to be "His fulness," the complete image of Him in all His glorified humanity. But it may be questioned whether it is not better to take here a different sense, corresponding to the "patch" in <a href="/matthew/9-16.htm" title="No man puts a piece of new cloth to an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.">Matthew 9:16</a>, and signifying the "complement." In the original Greek of Euclid (in Book 1., Prop. 4), the cognate word, <span class= "ital">parapleroma, </span>is used of "the complements." In this compound word the idea is, no doubt, more unequivocally expressed. But of the simple word here employed it may be reasonably contended that, if one thing or person alone is contemplated, the <span class= "ital">pleroma</span> must be the fulness of the one nature; if, as here, two are brought in, each will be the "complement" to the other--as the patch to the garment, and the garment to the patch. So here (says Chrysostom) "the complement of the Head is the Body, and the complement of the Body is the Head." Thus by a daring expression, St. Paul describes our Lord as conceiving His glorified humanity incomplete without His Church; and then, lest this should seem to derogate even for a moment from His dignity, he adds the strongest declaration of His transcendent power, "to fill up for Himself all things in all," in order to show that we are infinitely more incomplete without Him than He without us. This sense, bold as it is, certainly suits exactly the great idea of this Epistle, which differs from the parallel Colossian Epistle in this--that while both dwell emphatically on Christ the Head, and the Church as His Body, there the chief stress is laid on the true Deity of the Head, here on the glory and privileges of the Body. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which is his body.</span> The Church is Christ's body in a real though spiritual sense. He is the Head, his people the members; he the Vine, they the branches. He dwells in the Church as life dwells in a living body. He fills it with his life, replenishes it with his strength, feeds it with his body and blood, beautifies it with his comeliness, calms it with his peace, brightens it with his holiness, and finally glorifies it with his glory. All things are delivered unto him of the Father; and all that he has he has for the Church: "My beloved is mine, and I am his." <span class="cmt_word">The fullness of him that filleth all in all</span>. The grammatical structure of the words would lead us to construe "fullness" with "the Church," and to regard the Church as Christ's <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Some object to this, inasmuch as, in point of fact, the Church is often very empty, and therefore not worthy of the term "fullness." But it is not meant that the Church has actually received all the fullness of him who filleth all in all, but only that she is in the course of receiving it. The Church on earth is an ever-changing body, perpetually receiving new members, who are at first empty; so that it must always in this state be in the course of filling, never filled. It is in the course of being filled with all Divine things - with all the treasures of heaven. As the empty cells of the honeycomb are being filled with the sweet essences of flowers, so the empty vessels of the Church are being filled with the glorious treasures of God; or, as the courts and compartments of a great international exhibition get filled up with the choicest products of the lands, so the Church gets filled with the handiwork of the grace of God. When the Church is completed, it will be a representation of the fullness of God; all of God that can be communicated to men will be made manifest in the Church. For he whose fullness the Church is, is he that filleth all in all, or filleth all with all. He possesses all things, and he fills all space with the all things. He fills the ocean with water, the organic world with life, the firmament with stars, the entire creation with forms innumerable, alike beautiful and useful. So also he fills the Church. Thus appropriately concludes this chapter, beginning (ver. 3) with thanksgiving to him who had blessed the Ephesians with every blessing of the Spirit in Christ Jesus, and now ending with a sublime picture of the Infinite One filling the Church with these Divine blessings out of the infinite stores of the kingdom of heaven.
