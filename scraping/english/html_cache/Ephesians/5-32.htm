In Ephesians, Paul frequently uses "mystery" to describe the unfolding plan of God, particularly the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community (<a href="/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). The profound nature of this mystery highlights its significance and depth, suggesting that it is beyond human understanding without divine revelation. The concept of mystery also connects to the Old Testament, where God's plans were often concealed until the appointed time (<a href="/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28-30</a>).<p><b>but I am speaking about Christ and the church</b><br>Here, Paul clarifies that the profound mystery he refers to is the relationship between Christ and the church. This relationship is often depicted as a marriage, with Christ as the bridegroom and the church as His bride (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). This imagery is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is frequently portrayed as the bride of Yahweh (<a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5-6</a>). The union of Christ and the church is a type of the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant promises, reflecting the intimate and sacrificial love Christ has for His people. This relationship is central to understanding the purpose and function of the church in the world, as it embodies the love, unity, and mission of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

(1) The indissoluble and paramount sacredness of marriage, as all history shows, is "a mystery"--that is (see <a href="/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>), a secret of God's law, fully revealed in Christ alone. For in heathen, and, to some extent, even in Jewish thought, marriage was a contract far less sacred than the indissoluble tie of blood; and wherever Christian principle is renounced or obscured, that ancient idea recurs in modern times. It may be noted that from the translation here of the word "mystery," by <span class= "ital">sacramentum</span> in the Latin versions, the application of the word "sacrament" to marriage arose. (2) But the following words, "But I" (the word "I" being emphatic) "speak concerning Christ and the Church," show--what indeed the whole passage has already shown--that St. Paul's chief thought has passed from the type to the Antitype. He has constantly dwelt on points which suit only Christ's relation to the Church, and to that relation he has, by an irresistible gravitation of thought, been brought back again and again. (3) Yet the two cannot be separate. The type brings out some features of the Antitype which no other comparison makes clear; and history shows that the sacredness of the type in the Church has depended on this great passage--bearing, as it does, emphatic witness against the ascetic tendency to look on marriage as simply a concession to weakness, and as leading to a life necessarily lower than the celibate life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This mystery is a great one; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the Church.</span> The matter referred to is the typical relation between the marriage of man and wife, and the union of Christ and the Church. It is called a mystery, and it is not said, as is said of another mystery, referred to before (<a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>), that it has been completely explained. Some light has been thrown upon it, but that is all. It is implied that there is something of mystery in many of the relations between things natural and things spiritual, but that in the depth and grandeur of the subject, the mystery connected with the marriage relation is pre-eminent - it is "a great mystery" The analogy of the wind to the Holy Spirit; the springing up of plants to the resurrection; the melancholy sounds of nature to the prevalence of sin; and many other analogies, present vague shadows of truth, the clear, full forms of which we cannot see. When the day breaks and "the shadows flee away," such things will appear in a clearer light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">mystery</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#942;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(myst&#275;rion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3466.htm">Strong's 3466: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a derivative of muo; a secret or 'mystery'.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
