The concept of being "chosen" reflects the Old Testament idea of Israel as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, this extends to all who are in Christ, signifying a spiritual inheritance. The phrase "in Him" underscores the centrality of Jesus in the believer's life, echoing <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where Jesus describes Himself as the vine and believers as the branches. This union with Christ is foundational to understanding the believer's position and privileges.<p><b>having been predestined</b><br>Predestination is a theme that appears throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>. It refers to God's sovereign choice and foreknowledge, indicating that believers are part of God's eternal plan. This concept is rooted in the understanding of God's omniscience and omnipotence, suggesting that He has a purpose and plan for each believer's life. The idea of predestination assures believers of their secure position in God's family, providing comfort and assurance of salvation.<p><b>according to the plan of Him</b><br>This phrase highlights God's intentional and purposeful design. The "plan" refers to God's redemptive purpose throughout history, which is evident from Genesis to Revelation. It reflects the idea that God is not random or reactive but has a deliberate strategy for His creation. This aligns with <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>, where God speaks of having plans for welfare and not for evil, to give a future and hope.<p><b>who works out everything</b><br>God's sovereignty is emphasized here, indicating that He is actively involved in the unfolding of history and the lives of individuals. This aligns with <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures believers that God works all things together for good. The phrase suggests that nothing is outside of God's control or beyond His ability to use for His purposes. It reassures believers that even in difficult circumstances, God is at work.<p><b>by the counsel of His will</b><br>This phrase underscores the wisdom and deliberation of God's actions. "Counsel" implies thoughtful consideration and planning, suggesting that God's will is not arbitrary but is based on His perfect wisdom and understanding. This is consistent with <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning and His purpose will stand. It assures believers that God's will is ultimately for their good and His glory, providing a foundation for trust and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

Everything that follows&#8212;our identity, purpose, and future&#8212;flows from a real union with the risen Lord. Paul repeats this Christ-centered emphasis throughout the chapter (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4&#8211;7</a>; 1:13). Just as <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a> reminds us that &#8220;apart from Me you can do nothing,&#8221; so here Paul makes clear that every spiritual blessing comes only &#8220;in Him.&#8221; <a href="/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus&#8221;.<p>Why it matters:<p>&#8226; Your standing before God is not grounded in your performance but in your relationship with Christ.<p>&#8226; All blessings named in <a href="/bsb/ephesians/1.htm">Ephesians 1</a>&#8212;election, adoption, redemption, inheritance&#8212;are secure because they are tied to Jesus&#8217; finished work (<a href="/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we were also chosen as God&#8217;s own</b><p>Being &#8220;chosen&#8221; speaks of personal, deliberate selection. Believers are not anonymous faces in a crowd; God hand-picked us for Himself, just as He chose Israel to be His treasured possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). Jesus underscored this truth when He told the disciples, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p>Implications:<p>&#8226; Your value is defined by God&#8217;s choice, not by culture or circumstances (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God chose us &#8220;as His own,&#8221; we belong to a family; isolation and abandonment have no final say (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>having been predestined according to the plan of Him</b><p>&#8220;Predestined&#8221; means God set our destiny in advance, fitting perfectly with His comprehensive plan.

God taking us for his own heritage involves more than our getting an inheritance from God (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-20.htm">Deuteronomy 4:20</a>, "The Lord hath taken you... to be unto him a people of inheritance"). It is implied that God will protect, care for, improve, and enjoy his own inheritance; he will be much with them and do all that is necessary for them. Formerly God's inheritance was Israel only; but now it is much wider. All that God was to Israel of old he will be to his Church now. <span class="cmt_word">Having been predestinated according to the purpose.</span> The reason why the reference to predestination is repeated is to show that this new privilege of the whole Church as God's inheritance is not a fortuitous benefit, but the result of God's deliberate and eternal foreordination; it rests therefore on an immovable foundation. <span class="cmt_word">Of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will.</span> Predestination is not an exception to God's usual way of working; he works, or works out (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">all</span> things on the same principle, according to the decision to which his will comes. When we think of the sovereign will of God as determining all things, and in particular determining who are to be his heritage, we must remember how differently constituted the will of an infinitely holy Being is from that of frail and fallen creatures. The fallen creature's will is often whimsical, the result of some freak or fancy; often, too, it is the outcome of pride, avarice, sensual affection, or some other evil feeling; but God's will is the expression of his infinite perfections, and must always be infinitely holy, wise, and good. Willfulness in man is utterly different from willfulness in God; but the recoil we often have from the doctrine of God's doing all things from his mere <span class="accented">bene placitum</span>, or according to the counsel of his own will, arises from a tendency to ascribe to his will the caprice which is true only of our own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
