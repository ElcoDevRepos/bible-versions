Grace, in the biblical context, refers to God's kindness and love extended to humanity, despite their sinfulness. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's grace is evident in His covenant with Israel (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The New Testament further reveals this grace through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's grace (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). Salvation by grace underscores that human efforts or works cannot achieve redemption; it is solely a divine act.<p><b>through faith</b><br>Faith is the means by which individuals receive God's grace. It involves trust and reliance on Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen. This faith is not merely intellectual assent but a deep-seated trust in God's promises. The Apostle Paul, who authored Ephesians, often contrasts faith with works, emphasizing that faith is the channel through which grace is received (<a href="/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>).<p><b>and this not from yourselves;</b><br>This phrase highlights that salvation is not a result of human effort or merit. It counters any notion of self-reliance or self-righteousness. In the cultural context of Ephesus, where various religious practices and philosophies promoted self-improvement and works-based righteousness, this statement would have been countercultural. It aligns with Paul's broader theological argument that human boasting is excluded in the economy of salvation (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-29.htm">1 Corinthians 1:29</a>).<p><b>it is the gift of God,</b><br>Salvation is described as a gift, emphasizing its gratuitous nature. A gift, by definition, is something given freely, not earned or deserved. This concept is central to the Christian understanding of God's love and generosity. The idea of a divine gift is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>, which contrasts the wages of sin with the gift of eternal life. This gift is ultimately realized in the person and work of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate expression of God's love and grace to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

(Comp. <a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>.) In both there is the same doctrine of "Justification by Faith," the same denial of the merit of good works, the same connection of good works with the grace of God in us. But what is there anxiously and passionately contended for, is here briefly summarised, and calmly assumed as a thing known and allowed. Even the technical phrases--the word "justification," and the declaration of the nullity of "the Law"--are no longer used.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">By grace are ye saved through faith.</span>--Properly, <span class= "ital">ye have been saved;</span> ye were saved at first, and continue in a state of salvation. In <a href="/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a> this thought is introduced parenthetically, naturally and irresistibly suggested by the declaration of the various steps of regeneration in Christ. St. Paul now returns to it and works it out, before passing on, in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11</a>, to draw out by "wherefore" the conclusion from <a href="/context/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1-7</a>. Remembering how the Epistles were written from dictation, we may be inclined to see in this passage among others, an insertion made by the Apostle, on a revision of that already written. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For by grace have ye been saved, through faith.</span> He repeats what he had said parenthetically (ver. 5), in order to open the subject up more fully. On the part of God, salvation is by grace; on the part of man, it is through faith. It does not come to us by an involuntary act, as light falls on our eyes, sounds on our ears, or air enters our lungs. When we are so far enlightened as to understand about it, there must be a personal reception of salvation by us, and that is by faith. Faith at once believes the good news of a free salvation through Christ, and accepts Christ as the Savior. We commit ourselves to him, trust ourselves to him for that salvation of which he is the Author. In the act of thus entrusting ourselves to him for his salvation, we receive the benefit, and are saved. It is not that faith is accepted by God in place of works, but because faith indicates that attitude of men towards Christ in which it pleases God to save them, transferring to him all their guilt, imputing to them all his merit. <span class="cmt_word">And that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.</span> Which of the two things is meant - salvation or faith? The grammatical structure and the analogy of the passage favor the former view, "Your salvation is not of yourselves," though many able men have taken the latter. The apostle is so anxious to bring out the great distinguishing doctrine of grace that he puts it in all lights, affirms it positively, contrasts it with its opposite, and emphasizes it by repetition. It is a gift, not a purchase; a free gift, without money and without price; what would never have been yours, but for the generosity of God. It is very usual in the New Testament thus to represent salvation; cf. our Lord's words to Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>); to the woman of Samaria (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>); St. Paul's "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift" (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-15.htm">2 Corinthians 9:15</a>); "The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>); and <a href="/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11</a>, "God <span class="accented">gave</span> unto us eternal life, and the life is in his Son." This usage confirms the view that it is not merely faith, but the whole work and person of Christ which faith receives, that is meant here as the "gift of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For [it is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
