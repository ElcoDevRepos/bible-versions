In biblical context, "infants" refers to those who are immature in their faith, lacking discernment and understanding. <a href="/hebrews/5-13.htm">Hebrews 5:13-14</a> contrasts spiritual milk with solid food, urging believers to grow in their faith. The call to maturity is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1-2</a>, where he addresses the Corinthians as infants in Christ.<p><b>tossed about by the waves</b><br>The imagery of being tossed by waves suggests instability and vulnerability. In the ancient world, the sea was often seen as chaotic and dangerous, symbolizing uncertainty and peril. <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a> uses similar imagery to describe a doubting person as being like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind. This metaphor highlights the need for a firm foundation in Christ to withstand life's challenges.<p><b>and carried around by every wind of teaching</b><br>This phrase warns against being swayed by false doctrines. The early church faced numerous heresies and false teachings, such as Gnosticism and Judaizers, which threatened to lead believers astray. <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a> warns against turning to a different gospel, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the true teachings of Christ. The metaphor of wind suggests the ever-changing and unpredictable nature of false teachings.<p><b>and by the clever cunning of men</b><br>Here, Paul addresses the intentional deceit by false teachers. The term "clever cunning" implies a calculated and strategic effort to mislead. In <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13-15</a>, Paul describes false apostles as deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. This highlights the need for discernment and vigilance in recognizing and resisting such deception.<p><b>in their deceitful scheming</b><br>This phrase underscores the deliberate and malicious intent behind false teachings. The Greek word for "scheming" suggests a methodical and organized plan to deceive. <a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a> advises believers to put on the full armor of God to stand against the devil's schemes, indicating that spiritual warfare involves recognizing and countering deceit.

Thus, in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-11.htm" title="When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.">1Corinthians 13:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/5-13.htm" title="For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.">Hebrews 5:13</a>, it describes crudeness and shallowness of conception; in <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>, incapability of free self-direction; here, liability to disturbance and change by every external impression from without, so as to be "everything by turns and nothing long." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we he no more children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of teaching.</span> The apostle goes back to illustrate in another way the purpose of the ministry; it is designed to remedy childish fickleness and the causes that lead to it. The ignorant and inexperienced lie at the mercy of abler persons, and, when there is no regular ministry provided by Christ, are liable to be swept along by any plausible person that professes to be a Christian teacher, and such persons are often very dangerous, working <span class="cmt_word">by the sleight of men,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the cunning legerdemain by which the teachings of men - teachings devised by the hearts of men - are made to appear to the uninitiated the same as Christ's teaching. <span class="cmt_word">In craftiness, tending to the scheme of error.</span> Such teachers employ crafty methods, apparently harmless, but tending to further the method or scheme of error.
