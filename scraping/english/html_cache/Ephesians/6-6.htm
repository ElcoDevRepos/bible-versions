In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, where slavery was prevalent, slaves often worked under the watchful eyes of their masters. The call here is to transcend mere eye-service, which is superficial and insincere. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>, which also advises against working only when being observed. The deeper principle is integrity, a consistent theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>, which speaks of the upright being guided by their integrity.<p><b>but as servants of Christ</b><br>This phrase redefines the believer's identity and motivation. Regardless of earthly status, Christians are ultimately serving Christ. This echoes the teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, where service to others is equated with service to Christ Himself. The concept of being a servant of Christ elevates the believer's work to a divine calling, transcending earthly hierarchies and reflecting the servanthood of Jesus, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>.<p><b>doing the will of God from your heart</b><br>This phrase calls for wholehearted obedience, aligning one's actions with God's will. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands loving God with all one's heart. The will of God is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which encourages believers to discern and follow God's will. This phrase underscores the transformation of the believer's inner life, aligning it with divine purposes, and reflects the new covenant promise of a heart transformed by the Spirit, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the church to whom this letter was addressed was located.

The word "eyeservice" (used here, and in <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>) is peculiar to St. Paul, and to these passages; the word "menpleasers" is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but is used in the LXX.; and the antithesis of "pleasing men" and "pleasing God "is not unfrequent with St. Paul. (See <a href="/context/galatians/1-10.htm" title="For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.">Galatians 1:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which tries our hearts.">1Thessalonians 2:4</a>.) To a slave, looking on his master's authority as mere power imposed by the cruel laws of man, this "eyeservice" is found to be an all but irresistible temptation. It is only when he looks on himself as "the slave of Christ"--who Himself "took on Him the form of a slave" (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7</a>) in order to work out the will of God in a sinful world, and to redeem all men from bondage--that he can possibly serve from the heart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not in the spirit of eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the bond-servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</span> Exegetical of the last exhortation, with a negative and a positive clause, according to the apostle's frequent practice (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8, 19</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15, 25, 28, 29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18, 27, 29</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>).
