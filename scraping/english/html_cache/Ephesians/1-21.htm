In the Greco-Roman world, "rule and authority" often referred to various levels of spiritual beings or deities believed to influence human affairs. The assertion here is that Christ is exalted above all these powers, affirming His divine sovereignty. This echoes <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, which states that all things were created through and for Him, highlighting His preeminence over all creation.<p><b>power and dominion</b><br>These terms further underscore the comprehensive nature of Christ's authority. "Power" and "dominion" can refer to both spiritual forces and earthly rulers. In the context of Ephesus, a city known for its magical practices and worship of Artemis, this declaration would reassure believers of Christ's ultimate control over any spiritual or magical forces. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Jesus, indicating His ultimate dominion.<p><b>and every name that is named</b><br>In ancient cultures, names held significant power and were often invoked in magical or religious rites. By stating that Christ is above "every name that is named," the text asserts His superiority over all spiritual and earthly entities, including those invoked in pagan practices. This reflects the belief in the power of Jesus' name, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>, where salvation is found in no other name.<p><b>not only in the present age</b><br>This phrase indicates the timeless nature of Christ's authority. The "present age" refers to the current era of human history, characterized by spiritual conflict and the presence of evil. Christ's reign is not limited to this time but extends beyond it, offering hope and assurance to believers facing persecution or spiritual warfare.<p><b>but also in the one to come</b><br>This points to the eschatological future, the age to come when Christ's kingdom will be fully realized. It assures believers of the eternal nature of Christ's rule, which will be fully manifested in the new heaven and new earth as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. This future hope is a central theme in Christian eschatology, promising a time when Christ's authority will be universally acknowledged and His peace will reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

The words rendered "principality and power" (more properly signifying "government and the authority committed to it") are used in <a href="/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="/luke/20-20.htm" title="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.">Luke 20:20</a>; <a href="/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,">Titus 3:1</a>, distinctively for earthly-powers; in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>, generally for all created powers whatever. But St. Paul mostly employs this whole group of words, especially in the Epistles of the Captivity, with a manifest reference to angelic powers of good or evil. Thus in <a href="/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a> we read, of "angels, and principalities, and powers" (as in <a href="/1_peter/3-22.htm" title="Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.">1Peter 3:22</a>, "angels, and authorities, and powers"); in <a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> of this Epistle, of "principalities and powers in the heavenly places;" and in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>, of "wrestling <span class= "ital">not against flesh and blood, </span>but against principalities and powers," &c.; and in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, of "things in heaven and earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers." It is likely that he was induced so to do by the half-Gnostic speculation on the nature and worship of angels, prevalent in the later Judaism, of which we have a specimen at Colossae (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>)--in the same spirit which leads the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews to dwell so emphatically (in Ephesians 1, 2) on the infinite superiority of the Son of God to all angels. We observe that his references to these orders or aspects of the angelic hierarchy vary both in fulness and in order. (Comp., for instance, this passage with <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>.) Hence we gain no encouragement for the elaborate speculation in which men have indulged as to the right succession and relation of the hosts of heaven. In this passage the names rather point to different aspects, than to different orders, of superhuman power. The first two words signify appointed government and the authority which is committed to it; the last two the actual force and the moral force of dignity or lordship in which it is clothed. In the Colossian passage the words here placed first come last, though in the same mutual connection, and the words "dignities or lordships" is connected with the word "thrones," not here found. His purpose is, indeed, better served by this comparative vagueness: for that purpose is to exalt the majesty of our Lord over all other, whatever it may be, and whatever name it may wear. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Far above all rule, and power, and might, and dominion.</span> Separate shades of meaning may doubtless be found for these expressions, but the main effect of the accumulation is to expand and deepen the idea of Christ's universal lordship. Hardly anything is revealed to us on the various orders of the spiritual powers, unfallen and fallen; and the speculations on them in which the Fathers used to indulge are of no value; but whatever may be true of them, Christ is exalted far above them all - far above every creature in earth, heaven, or hell (comp. <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>; <a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>; <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</span> The pro-eminence of his Name is to be eternal. It shall never be eclipsed by any other name, nor shall there ever be a name worthy to be coupled with his Name. In human history we find no name that can be fitly coupled with Christ's. In the world to come, it shall ever shine forth with an unapproached effulgence. All this is said to exalt our sense of the Divine power that so raised up and exalted the God-Man, Christ Jesus - the same power that still works in believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">far above</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#940;&#957;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(hyperan&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5231.htm">Strong's 5231: </a> </span><span class="str2">Far above.
