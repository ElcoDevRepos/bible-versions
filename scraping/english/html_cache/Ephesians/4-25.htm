The term "put off" suggests a deliberate action, akin to removing a garment, indicating a conscious decision to abandon falsehood. In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing a community of believers who are called to live in unity and holiness. The rejection of falsehood is foundational to maintaining trust and integrity within the body of Christ. This directive echoes the ninth commandment, "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor" (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>), underscoring the continuity of moral law from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>and speak truthfully to his neighbor</b><br>The call to speak truthfully is rooted in the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). In the Greco-Roman world, where Paul was writing, honesty was not always a cultural norm, making this exhortation countercultural. Truthfulness is essential for building and maintaining relationships within the Christian community. This phrase also reflects the teachings of Jesus, who declared Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and who emphasized the importance of truth in His ministry. Speaking truthfully is a reflection of the character of God, who is described as a God of truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>).<p><b>for we are all members of one another</b><br>This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of believers within the body of Christ. Paul uses the metaphor of the body to describe the church, where each member is essential and interdependent (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). The unity of believers is a recurring theme in Ephesians, emphasizing that Christians are not isolated individuals but part of a larger community. This interconnectedness means that falsehood not only harms the individual but also the entire community. The call to truthfulness is thus not merely a personal ethic but a communal responsibility. This concept is further reinforced by the idea that believers are "one body and one Spirit" (<a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>), united in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

Truth is the first condition of the mutual confidence which is the basis of all unity. Hence it is the first duty of that "membership one of another," which follows from our being "one body in Christ" (<a href="/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-27.htm" title="Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.">1Corinthians 12:27</a>). No doubt it is also the first duty to our own humanity, and to the God "who hateth a lie." But these views, though true in themselves, would not be relevant to St. Paul's great subject here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>. - RAGS OF THE OLD MAN AND ROBES OF THE NEW. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak every man truth with his neighbor.</span> Lying or falsehood is pre-eminently a heathen vice, as missionaries in India and other countries abundantly testify. It is an attribute of fallen humanity: "They go astray from the womb, speaking lies;" and one of the earliest vices that appear in children is deceit. Not only is it God's will and command that we speak the truth, but it is peculiarly incumbent on Christians as children of the light, as followers of him who is the Truth, as having renounced the devil, who is the father of lies. Another reason is added. <span class="cmt_word">For ye are members one of another.</span> Falsehood is always designed to mislead; but to deceive our own members is emphatically wicked. Says Chrysostom (quoted by Eddie), "Let not the eye lie to the foot, nor the foot to the eye. If there be a deep pit, and its mouth, covered with reeds, shall present to the eye the appearance of solid ground, will not the eye use the foot to ascertain whether it is hollow underneath or whether it is firm and resists? Will the foot tell a lie, and not the truth as it is? And what, again, if the eye were to spy a serpent or a wild beast, will it lie to the foot?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(Dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
