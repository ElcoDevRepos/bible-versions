The Apostle Paul often uses Old Testament references to connect the teachings of Christ with the Hebrew Scriptures, showing continuity in God's plan. This method of teaching was common in Jewish tradition, where rabbis would cite scripture to support their teachings.<p><b>&#8220;When He ascended on high:</b><br>The imagery of ascending on high is often associated with victory and triumph. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king or military leader would ascend to a high place after a victory, symbolizing authority and dominion. This phrase is understood to refer to Christ's ascension into heaven after His resurrection, signifying His victory over sin and death. It echoes the ascension of a victorious king returning from battle.<p><b>He led captives away:</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a triumphal procession, where a victorious leader would lead captives as a demonstration of their conquest. In the context of Ephesians, it is interpreted as Christ leading spiritual captives&#8212;those who were once bound by sin and death&#8212;into freedom. This imagery is consistent with the Roman practice of triumphal processions, where captives were paraded as a sign of victory.<p><b>and gave gifts to men.&#8221;</b><br>The giving of gifts is a reference to the distribution of spiritual gifts to the church. In ancient times, a victorious king would distribute spoils or gifts to his people. Here, it signifies the spiritual gifts given by Christ to believers, empowering them for service and building up the body of Christ. This concept is further elaborated in the subsequent verses of <a href="/ephesians/4.htm">Ephesians 4</a>, where Paul discusses the various gifts and roles within the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul is writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage unity and maturity in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one who ascended on high, leading captives and giving gifts to men, fulfilling the prophecy and demonstrating His victory over sin and death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the early church was established.

By pointing back to <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>, he signals that the psalm&#8217;s triumph theme has reached its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus. The apostle never treats God&#8217;s Word as a loose collection of inspirational sayings; rather, what is written stands as the final authority (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>Key ideas:<p>&#8226; Scripture interprets Scripture&#8212;Paul cites an Old Testament victory psalm to illuminate Christ&#8217;s work.<p>&#8226; The unfolding storyline of redemption is cohesive: God&#8217;s past acts anticipate His climactic act in Jesus (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When He ascended on high</b><p>The picture shifts to Christ&#8217;s bodily ascension after His resurrection (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9&#8211;11</a>).

The very change from the second person to the third person shows it to be a free quotation; and this is made far more evident by the remarkable variation from the text of the original, which runs, <span class= "ital">Thou receivedst gifts in man</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>probably, "among men;" and adds, "even the rebellious, that the Lord God might dwell among them"--a clause which (from <a href="/context/ephesians/4-29.htm" title="Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.">Ephesians 4:29-31</a>) we may suppose to refer to the homage of the heathen to the Lord Jehovah. Now, it has been noted that the word "received" is used constantly for "receiving," or "fetching," for another (<a href="/genesis/15-9.htm" title="And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.">Genesis 15:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/18-5.htm" title="And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort you your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are you come to your servant. And they said, So do, as you have said.">Genesis 18:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/27-13.htm" title="And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.">Genesis 27:13</a>, <span class= "ital">et al</span>.); and it appears that the Chaldee Targum actually has here, as a gloss: "Thou hast given gifts to the sons of men," interpreting the words, curiously enough, of Moses as a mediator between God and man. The psalm also was recognised as a Messianic psalm, foreshadowing the dwelling of "God with us" in the universal kingdom of the true Mediator. St. Paul accordingly uses it with a bold variation suiting his context. The key to this use is found in the truth enunciated of our Lord in <a href="/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>, that "being by the right hand of God exalted, and <span class= "ital">having received</span> of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, <span class= "ital">He hath shed forth this."</span> Our Lord, as the Head of humanity, receives only in order to give. From the means, therefore, the Apostle passes to the end. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high he led captivity captive, and received gifts for men.</span> The speaker is God, the author of Scripture, and the place is the sixty-eighth psalm. That psalm is a psalm of triumph, where the placing of the ark on Zion is celebrated as if it had been a great victory. As this quotation shows, the psalm in its deepest sense is Messianic, celebrating the victory of Christ. The substance rather than the words of the passage are given, for the second person ("thou hast ascended," etc.) is changed into the third; and whereas in the psalm it is said, "gave gifts <span class="accented">to</span> men," as modified by the apostle it is said, "received gifts for men." As in a literal triumph, the chiefs of the enemy's army are led captive, so the powers of darkness were led captive by Christ (captivity, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, denotes <span class="accented">prisoners</span>); and as on occasion of a triumph the spoils of the enemy are made over to the conqueror, who again gives them away among the soldiers and people, so gifts were given to Christ after his triumph to be given by him to his Church. We must not force the analogy too far: the point is simply this - as a conqueror at a triumph gets gifts to distribute, so Christ, on his resurrection and ascension, got the Holy Spirit to bestow on his Church (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This is why</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(dio)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1352.htm">Strong's 1352: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wherefore, on which account, therefore.
