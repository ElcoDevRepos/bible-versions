The ability of God is emphasized in various biblical narratives, such as the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks the universe into existence. This power is not limited by human understanding or capability, as seen in the miraculous events throughout the Bible, including the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28:1-10</a>).<p><b>to do immeasurably more</b><br>The concept of God doing "immeasurably more" highlights His infinite nature and the boundless scope of His power and grace. This is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than ours. The term "immeasurably" suggests that God's actions and plans surpass human limitations and expectations, aligning with the theme of divine abundance found in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving life "more abundantly."<p><b>than all we ask or imagine</b><br>This phrase underscores the limitations of human understanding and the vastness of God's provision. It reflects the idea that God's plans and blessings exceed our prayers and thoughts, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>, which speaks of things God has prepared for those who love Him that are beyond human comprehension. This encourages believers to trust in God's wisdom and timing, even when circumstances seem challenging.<p><b>according to His power</b><br>The power referenced here is the same power that raised Christ from the dead, as mentioned earlier in <a href="/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>. This power is not only a demonstration of God's might but also a transformative force in the lives of believers. It is the Holy Spirit's work within us, enabling us to live out our faith and fulfill God's purposes, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers receive power to be witnesses.<p><b>that is at work within us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in believers, a key theme in the New Testament. The Spirit's work within us is transformative, producing spiritual fruit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and empowering us for service (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>).

Paul had asked much in this prayer, and thoughts can always travel beyond words, yet the excess of God's power beyond both was infinite. This excess is denoted by a double term of abundance (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), as if the apostle wished to fill our minds with the idea of absolute infinity of gracious power in God. <span class="cmt_word">According to the power that worketh in us</span>, which is none other than the power "which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead" (<a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>).

Amen.</span> To God the whole credit of the scheme of grace and the work of grace as carried out in his people is due ("Not of works, lest any man should boast"); therefore let the Church acknowledge this, and cordially and openly ascribe to God his due. Let this feeling be universally encouraged and cherished in the Church, and let it find in the Church services suitable occasions of breaking forth in song and prayer. Again the apostle's favorite formula comes in" in Christ Jesus," to denote that this act of adoration is to be done in immediate connection with the work and person of Christ; for it is he who has brought about the whole condition of things from which the act of adoration springs. And this ascription of praise is not transitory; this view of the Divine character and actings will never become obsolete or be superseded by other views; it will claim their cordial ascriptions forever - literally, <span class="accented">to all the generations of the age of the ages</span>. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to [Him] who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(T&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
