In biblical times, the "heart" was considered the center of intellect and emotion, not just feelings. Enlightenment here refers to divine illumination, a theme echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>, where the psalmist asks God to open his eyes to see the wonders of His law. This enlightenment is necessary for believers to grasp spiritual truths, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where the natural man cannot understand the things of the Spirit. The metaphor of "eyes" suggests clarity and insight, which are gifts of the Holy Spirit, enabling believers to discern God's will and purpose.<p><b>so that you may know the hope of His calling</b><br>The "hope" mentioned is not wishful thinking but a confident expectation rooted in God's promises. This hope is tied to God's calling, which is His invitation to salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ. <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a> speaks of those who are called according to God's purpose, highlighting the assurance and future glory that come with this calling. The hope of His calling is a central theme in the New Testament, providing believers with assurance and motivation to live godly lives, as seen in <a href="/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11-13</a>.<p><b>the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints</b><br>This phrase points to the abundant spiritual blessings and eternal inheritance that believers receive. The "riches" signify the immeasurable value of what God has prepared for His people, as described in <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>, where the inheritance is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading. The "glorious inheritance" reflects the splendor and majesty of God's kingdom, which believers are co-heirs with Christ, as stated in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. The term "in the saints" indicates that this inheritance is shared among all who are sanctified in Christ, emphasizing the communal aspect of God's promises and the unity of the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, writing to the church in Ephesus to encourage and instruct them in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, known for its temple to Artemis and a significant early Christian community.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_saints.htm">The Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the believers in Ephesus and, by extension, all Christians who are set apart for God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/enlightenment_of_the_heart.htm">Enlightenment of the Heart</a></b><br>The "eyes of your heart" is a metaphor for spiritual understanding.

The succession of ideas follows the order of conversion--first, "calling;" then acceptance to "inheritance;" lastly, "inward working of divine power" in the accepted. To each the conception of looking onward is attached; to the "calling" "hope," to the "inheritance" "glory," to the "power" the exaltation of Christ (and of us with Him; see <a href="/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>) to the right hand of God.<p><span class= "bld">The hope of his calling.</span>--(See <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm" title="There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;">Ephesians 4:4</a>.)

The glory which he invites you to look forward to, when Christ shall come again, how sure it is and how excellent! How infinitely it surpasses all earthly glory! How it at once ravishes and satisfies the heart! <span class="cmt_word">And what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.</span> If the saints form God's heritage (see ver. 11), it may be asked Where are the riches of God's glory in them? But it is not necessary to take the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> so literally. It may be rendered, "in reference to the saints." The riches of the glory of his inheritance in reference to the saints is the riches of the glory of their privileges as the Lord's heritage, or people; that is, their privileges are glorious. But this glory is not limp, limited - it is wonderfully rich, full, abundant. God gives liberally - gives as a King, gives glory to all Christ's people. "When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory" (<a href="/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>); "The glory which thou gavest me I have given them." The difference between this glory and ether glory is, human glory is often unjustly accorded, it passes away with wonderful quickness; but this glory is real and everlasting. "When the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[ I ask that ] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
