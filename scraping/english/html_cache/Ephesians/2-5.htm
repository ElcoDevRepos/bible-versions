In the context of Ephesians, Paul is addressing the believers in Ephesus, a city known for its pagan worship and the Temple of Artemis. The concept of being "made alive" signifies a spiritual resurrection, paralleling Christ's physical resurrection. This aligns with <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, where believers are said to walk in "newness of life." Theologically, this reflects the doctrine of regeneration, where the Holy Spirit imparts new life to the believer, as seen in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-8</a>.<p><b>even when we were dead in our trespasses</b><br>This highlights the state of spiritual death due to sin, a condition shared by all humanity as described in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. The term "dead" signifies complete separation from God, echoing the fall of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, which introduced sin into the world. The use of "trespasses" indicates deliberate acts of disobedience against God's law. This phrase underscores the depth of God's mercy, as He initiates salvation while humanity is still in rebellion, similar to the prodigal son narrative in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>.<p><b>It is by grace you have been saved!</b><br>This statement encapsulates the core of the gospel message: salvation is a gift from God, not earned by human effort. The concept of grace, or "charis" in Greek, is central to Pauline theology, emphasizing unmerited favor. This is further explained in <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, where Paul clarifies that salvation is not by works. The idea of grace is rooted in the Old Testament, where God's covenant with Israel was based on His steadfast love and mercy, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>. This phrase also connects to <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, which speaks of salvation through God's mercy, not human righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor, Ephesus was a center of commerce and culture.

There the type and earnest of the working of God's mighty power are placed in the resurrection, the ascension, the glorification of Christ Himself in His human nature. Here what is there implied is worked out--(1) All Christians are declared to be quickened (or, <span class= "ital">risen again</span>) to spiritual life with Christ, according to His promise, "Because I live, ye shall live also" (<a href="/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>). (See the exact parallel in <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>.) But there is a promise even beyond this: "I am the life: whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die" (<a href="/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>; comp. also <a href="/john/5-24.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.">John 5:24</a>; <a href="/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>). Hence, even more emphatically, and in full accordance with this latter promise, we have in <a href="/colossians/3-4.htm" title=" When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.">Colossians 3:4</a>, "Christ who is our life;" as in <a href="/context/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10-11</a>, "The life of Jesus is made manifest in us." What this "life eternal" is He Himself declares (<a href="/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>)--"to know the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent." (2) Next, this partaking of the life of Christ is brought out in two striking forms--as a partaking, not only of His resurrection (as in <a href="/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1Corinthians 15:20-22</a>; <a href="/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Philippians 3:11</a>), but also (in a phase of thought peculiar to these Epistles) of His ascension "to the heavenly places." This is "in Christ Jesus," in virtue of a personal and individual union with Christ. It implies blessings, both present and future, or rather one blessing, of which we have the earnest now and the fulness hereafter--for the resurrection and ascension of Christ are even now the perfection and glorification of humanity in Him. (3) So far as we are really and vitally His members, such perfection and glorification are ours now, by His intercession (that is, His continued mediation for us in heaven) and by His indwelling in us by the Spirit on earth. The proof of partaking His resurrection is "newness of life," "death unto sin, and new birth unto righteousness" (<a href="/context/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5-11</a>), which is in <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a> expressly connected with the entrance upon unity with Christ in baptism. The proof of having "our life hid in Christ at the right hand of God," is "the setting our affection on things above" (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>), by which "in heart and mind we thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell." (4) These proofs are seen only in measure here. Through the change which we call death, we pass at once to a still higher stage of life, by fuller union with Christ (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:">2Corinthians 5:6-8</a>), and at the great day we shall have both in perfection--perfect newness of life in "likeness to Him" (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1John 3:2</a>), and perfect glorification in Him in that communion with God which is heaven (<a href="/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>; <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>). The one thing which St. Paul does not attribute to us is that which is His alone--the place "at the right hand of the Father." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even when we were dead in our sins.</span> Repeated from ver. 1, in order to set in its true light the declaration that follows of what God did for us to make more emphatic the free and sovereign mercy of God.
