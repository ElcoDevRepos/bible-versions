In the context of Ephesians, Paul addresses Gentile believers who were once excluded from the covenant promises given to Israel. The term "strangers" refers to those without rights or privileges in a community, while "foreigners" implies temporary residents without citizenship. This reflects the historical context of the Roman Empire, where citizenship was a prized status. Biblically, this echoes the Old Testament where Gentiles were often seen as outsiders to the covenant community of Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-43.htm">Exodus 12:43-49</a>). Theologically, this transition is made possible through Christ's reconciling work, breaking down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>).<p><b>but fellow citizens with the saints</b><br>Here, Paul emphasizes the inclusion of Gentile believers into the spiritual commonwealth of Israel. "Fellow citizens" suggests full membership and equal standing in God's kingdom. The "saints" refers to all believers, both Jew and Gentile, who are set apart for God. This citizenship is not based on ethnic or national identity but on faith in Christ. The concept of citizenship would resonate with the Ephesians, as Roman citizenship was highly valued and conferred specific rights and privileges. This phrase connects to <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, where Paul speaks of believers' citizenship in heaven, highlighting the eternal nature of this new identity.<p><b>and members of God&#8217;s household</b><br>This phrase deepens the sense of belonging by shifting from a civic metaphor to a familial one. Being "members of God&#8217;s household" implies intimacy, care, and a shared inheritance. In the ancient world, the household was the basic unit of society, encompassing family and servants under the authority of the head of the house. Spiritually, this reflects the believer's adoption into God's family through Jesus Christ (<a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>). It also connects to the imagery of the church as the body of Christ, where each member has a role and purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This familial relationship fulfills the promise of God dwelling among His people, as seen in the prophetic vision of <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the church to whom this letter was addressed was located.

Because that salvation is entirely by grace (2:8-9), the logical conclusion is introduced with &#8220;Therefore.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The word looks back to verses 11-18, where Gentiles were &#8220;separate from Christ&#8230; excluded from the commonwealth of Israel&#8221; (2:12), yet brought near &#8220;by the blood of Christ&#8221; (2:13).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;the same gracious truth Paul now applies.<p>&#8226; In short, everything that follows flows from the finished work of Jesus; nothing is earned, everything is gifted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are no longer strangers and foreigners</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Strangers&#8221; speaks of those without rights, and &#8220;foreigners&#8221; of temporary residents.

The latter word is used literally in <a href="/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>; <a href="/acts/7-29.htm" title="Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.">Acts 7:29</a> (there rendered "sojourner"), and often in the LXX. version; perhaps metaphorically in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>. Such a sojourner, though in some sense less an absolute alien than the mere "stranger," was one on whom by daily contrast the sense of being an alien, excluded from power and privilege, was more forcibly impressed.<p><span class= "bld">Fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.</span>--In sense this double expression preserves the double idea running through the whole chapter.

"Members of the household of God" refers rather to the union with God, restored by the blood of Jesus Christ. (See <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm" title="But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.">Ephesians 2:13</a>.)
