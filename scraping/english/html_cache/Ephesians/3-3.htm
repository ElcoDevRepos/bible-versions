This aligns with the broader theme of Ephesians, which emphasizes the unity of Jews and Gentiles in Christ.<p><b>made known to me by revelation</b><br>Paul emphasizes that the understanding of this mystery was not through human wisdom or teaching but through divine revelation.

By revelation, not by the wisdom of man (as in <a href="/context/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1Corinthians 2:7-16</a>): for "God hath revealed them to us by His Spirit." By direct revelation to St. Paul himself, as in <a href="/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>, "not of man or by man, but by revelation of Jesus Christ," and in <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, "according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery." (See also <a href="/2_corinthians/12-17.htm" title="Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?">2Corinthians 12:17</a>.) This revelation we may refer especially to the time when, after his conversion, he was "in a trance while praying in the Temple," and "saw Christ Himself," saying unto him, "Depart, for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles" (<a href="/context/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17-21</a>).<p><span class= "bld">As I wrote afore in few words.</span>--The reference is to the brief notice in <a href="/context/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10-14</a>, and to the further explanation in <a href="/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>. Hence, in English, the idea would be more clearly expressed by "I have written above." St. Paul refers them back to these passages as embodying his "understanding," or conception, of the mystery thus revealed especially to him. The reference is one of those parenthetical remarks, which, to those remembering how St. Paul's Epistles were dictated, almost irresistibly suggest insertion on the reading over of the Epistle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How that, by revelation, was made known unto me the mystery.</span> The mystery, as is explained afterwards (ver. 6), was not the gospel itself, but its destination to the Gentiles as much as to the Jews; although, as appears afterwards, this fullness of blessing is really the great glory of the gospel. Mystery, that which is known only to the initiated, does not denote here a thing obscure in its own nature, but only something that had been concealed from view. It was only the initiated that now knew that God designed the gospel for Gentile and Jew alike. Paul had been initiated "by revelation" - not by his own reflecting power, not by his study of Scripture, not by communication from ether men, but by a special communication from God (<a href="/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As I wrote before in few words.</span> Where?

If it be said the allusions in these places to the topic in question are rather vague and general, the apostle virtually admits it - he wrote of it "in few words;" but, as it is a great and glorious truth, he returns to it to amplify it and place it in a brighter light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">that [is],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
