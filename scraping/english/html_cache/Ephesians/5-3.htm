The early church was called to be set apart from the surrounding pagan culture, which was often characterized by moral laxity. The phrase "among you" indicates a collective responsibility within the body of believers to uphold a standard of holiness.<p><b>as is proper among the saints</b><br>The term "saints" refers to those who are set apart for God, highlighting the call to holiness. In the Old Testament, Israel was called to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), and this call is extended to the church. The word "proper" suggests that certain behaviors are fitting or appropriate for those who belong to God, aligning with the call to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><b>there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality</b><br>Sexual immorality, or "porneia" in Greek, encompasses a wide range of illicit sexual activities. In the Greco-Roman world, sexual immorality was prevalent and often accepted. The call for there to be "not even a hint" underscores the need for complete purity and the avoidance of any behavior that could lead to scandal or compromise the witness of the church.<p><b>or of any kind of impurity</b><br>Impurity extends beyond sexual immorality to include moral corruption and uncleanness in thought, word, and deed. This reflects the broader biblical theme of purity, which is essential for those who wish to approach God (<a href="/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3-4</a>). The call to avoid impurity is a call to live in a way that reflects God's holiness.<p><b>or of greed</b><br>Greed, or covetousness, is the insatiable desire for more, often at the expense of others. It is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>) and is seen as idolatry because it places material wealth or possessions above God. The early church was called to a life of contentment and generosity, reflecting the selfless love of Christ.<br><br>Each of these prohibitions&#8212;sexual immorality, impurity, and greed&#8212;are seen as incompatible with the life of a believer, who is called to reflect the character of Christ and live in a way that honors God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, providing guidance to the early Christian church.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located, known for its diverse culture and pagan practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ephesian_church.htm">The Ephesian Church</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, a community of believers navigating their faith amidst a secular society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saints.htm">Saints</a></b><br>Refers to the believers in Christ, called to live holy and set-apart lives.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/greco-roman_culture.htm">Greco-Roman Culture</a></b><br>The cultural backdrop of Ephesus, characterized by practices contrary to Christian teachings, such as sexual immorality and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_holiness.htm">Call to Holiness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live lives that reflect our identity as saints, set apart for God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_impurity.htm">Guarding Against Impurity</a></b><br>We must be vigilant in avoiding not just overt sin but even the appearance of sin, maintaining purity in thought and action.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_greed.htm">Understanding Greed</a></b><br>Greed is not just about money; it encompasses any excessive desire that takes precedence over our devotion to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_influence.htm">Cultural Influence</a></b><br>Recognize the impact of cultural norms on our behavior and strive to align our lives with biblical values rather than societal trends.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_and_community.htm">Accountability and Community</a></b><br>Engage with fellow believers for support and accountability in maintaining a lifestyle that honors God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ephesians_5_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ephesians 5:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Avoiding_immorality_daily_as_Christians.htm">How can we avoid "sexual immorality" in our daily lives as Christians?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_impurity_or_greed_in_Eph_5_3.htm">What does "any impurity or greed" mean in Ephesians 5:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ephesians_5_3_1_Cor_6_18_on_purity.htm">How does Ephesians 5:3 connect with 1 Corinthians 6:18 about purity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_maintain_holiness_in_speech_actions.htm">Why is it important to maintain holiness in our speech and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_ensure_complete_purity.htm">What practical steps can we take to ensure "not even a hint" of impurity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_is_Ephesians_5_3_s_view_on_sex_today.htm">How does Ephesians 5:3 define "sexual immorality" in a modern context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_purity_in_Ephesians_5_3.htm">Why does Ephesians 5:3 emphasize purity among believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Ephesians_5_3_today.htm">How should Christians apply Ephesians 5:3 in today's society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ephesians_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ephesians 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_eph._5_3-6_conflict_with_science.htm">Ephesians 5:3&#8211;6: Does this strict stance on sexual immorality conflict with scientific understandings of human sexuality?

Our daily choices either reinforce or blur that boundary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as is proper among the saints</b><p>&#8220;Saints&#8221; simply means those set apart in Christ. What is &#8220;proper&#8221; for us matches God&#8217;s character, not cultural trends (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12-14</a>). Holiness isn&#8217;t optional etiquette; it&#8217;s our family resemblance. When we remember who we are&#8212;adopted, cleansed, Spirit-indwelt&#8212;we&#8217;re motivated to live accordingly (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there must not be even a hint</b><p>Zero tolerance language. The Spirit doesn&#8217;t negotiate percentages of purity; He seeks the whole heart (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4-5</a>).

Practical steps:<p>&#8226; Guard what enters the mind&#8212;media, conversations, humor (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Flee tempting situations, don&#8217;t flirt with them (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Invite accountability; sin shrinks in the light (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of sexual immorality</b><p>Any sexual activity outside the covenant of one man and one woman in marriage falls here (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>). God&#8217;s design protects intimacy and displays Christ&#8217;s faithful love for the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>). Scripture repeatedly calls us to avoid every form of sexual sin&#8212;physical or mental (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>).

Paul says &#8220;any kind,&#8221; reminding us not to play favorites with sins. If something muddies our conscience or crowds out devotion, it belongs on the discard pile (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or of greed</b><p>Greed may feel unrelated, yet it springs from the same root: self-centered desire. Jesus warns, &#8220;Watch out and guard yourselves against every form of greed&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>). Covetousness is labeled idolatry because it worships created things over the Creator (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Generous, content hearts testify that Christ&#8212;not possessions&#8212;satisfies (<a href="/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6-10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a> calls believers to a lifestyle so distinctly pure that not even a rumor of sexual sin, moral filth, or covetous craving can stick. Because we are saints, God&#8217;s standard is not merely avoiding scandal but radiating holiness. The verse presses us to examine desires, habits, and motives, surrendering anything that competes with Christ&#8217;s lordship. In doing so, we display the beauty of the gospel to a watching world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3<span class= "ital">b</span>) <a href="/context/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3-14</a> warn, with even greater fulness and emphasis, against the sins of impurity and lust, as incompatible with membership of the kingdom of heaven, as works of darkness, impossible to those who are children of light.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or Christian light covetousness.</span>--"Fornication" is closely joined (as in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2Corinthians 12:21</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>) with "uncleanness," of which general sin it is a flagrant species.

At the same time, the constant connection of the two words suggests the truth which is conveyed by the union of the two kinds of "coveting" in the Tenth Commandment, viz., that the temper of selfish and unbridled concupiscence has a two-fold direction--to the covetousness of lust, and to the covetousness of avarice--the one perhaps especially a vice of youth, and the other of old age. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-21.</span> - THE WALK SUITABLE TO THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>.
