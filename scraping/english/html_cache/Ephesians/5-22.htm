The term "submit" is often understood as a voluntary yielding in love and respect, not as an enforced subjugation. This submission is modeled after the relationship between Christ and the Church, emphasizing mutual respect and love. The concept of submission here is not about inferiority but about order and function within the family unit, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3:1-6</a>. The idea of submission is also rooted in the creation order described in Genesis, where man and woman are created with distinct roles.<p><b>as to the Lord</b><br>This phrase provides the motivation and manner for the submission, indicating that it is ultimately an act of worship and obedience to Christ. The comparison to the Lord suggests that the submission is not absolute but is within the context of a godly relationship. It implies that the husband's leadership should reflect Christ's love and sacrifice for the Church, as elaborated in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>. This connection to the Lord elevates the act of submission to a spiritual level, aligning it with the broader Christian call to live in a way that honors God. The phrase also underscores the importance of a Christ-centered marriage, where both partners seek to emulate Christ's example in their relationship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul_the_apostle.htm">Paul the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter to the Ephesians, Paul was a key figure in the early Christian church, known for his missionary journeys and theological teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A major city in Asia Minor where the Ephesian church was located.

Just as God spoke directly to Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, Paul speaks directly to wives here, treating them as responsible covenant partners. The call is personal and relational, not generic. Similar direct addresses appear in <a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>, where wives are likewise encouraged in their distinct role within marriage. Notice that Scripture never portrays wives as second-class citizens; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> reminds us all are one in Christ Jesus. Yet equality in value coexists with difference in role, and Paul now focuses on that God-given role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>submit</b><p>&#8220;Submit&#8221; can sound heavy, so Paul&#8217;s choice to place it in a household context matters. Submission here is:<p>&#8226; Voluntary&#8212;never forced, echoing Christ&#8217;s own willing submission to the Father (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Respectful&#8212;expressed through honor and cooperation, not through silence or passivity (<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Purposeful&#8212;designed to reflect divine order, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a> where Christ Himself models submission within the Trinity.<p>It is not:<p>&#8226; Inferiority&#8212;both husband and wife bear God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Blind obedience&#8212;Peter and the apostles show that obeying God comes first (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p><a href="/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a> echoes the same word, calling submission &#8220;fitting in the Lord,&#8221; underscoring that this posture aligns with God&#8217;s good design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to your husbands</b><p>Paul narrows the sphere: a wife&#8217;s submission is directed &#8220;to your husbands,&#8221; not to all men everywhere. This safeguards her dignity and clarifies authority. Other passages underline the husband&#8217;s corresponding responsibility: &#8220;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>). Leadership without sacrificial love is foreign to biblical headship. Headship means:<p>&#8226; Accountability&#8212;husbands will answer to Christ for how they lead (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Service&#8212;modeled after Jesus washing His disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Provision and protection&#8212;reflected in God&#8217;s care for His people (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>).<p>When a husband serves this way, submission becomes a partnership, not a power struggle.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as to the Lord</b><p>The phrase &#8220;as to the Lord&#8221; anchors the whole command. A wife&#8217;s ultimate loyalty is to Christ; her submission to her husband flows out of that higher devotion. This means:<p>&#8226; Motivation&#8212;her actions seek to please Jesus first (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Boundaries&#8212;if a husband asks something contrary to God&#8217;s Word, obedience to Christ prevails (<a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Worship&#8212;daily marital interactions become acts of worship, mirroring the church&#8217;s submission to Christ (<a href="/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24</a>).<p>Just as the church gladly follows her Savior, a wife&#8217;s respectful submission becomes a living testimony of the gospel within her home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22</a> calls wives to a willing, respectful partnership with their own husbands, patterned after the church&#8217;s loving submission to Christ. This submission is voluntary, limited to the marriage relationship, and ultimately offered to the Lord Himself. When lived out alongside a husband&#8217;s Christ-like leadership, it showcases God&#8217;s beautiful design for marriage and paints a vivid picture of the gospel to everyone watching.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ephesians/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>[<span class= "bld">5.</span><span class= "bld">Practical Exhortation continued</span> (<a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22</a> to <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>).<p>(4)THE BEARING OF THE TRUTH OF UNITY ON THE THREE GREAT RELATIONS OF LIFE.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>)<span class= "ital">Between husbands and wives</span>--a relation which is a type of the unity between Christ and His Church (<a href="/context/ephesians/5-22.htm" title="Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>).<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>)<span class= "ital"> Between parents and children</span>--a relation hallowed as existing "in the Lord" (<a href="/context/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span>-<a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. - EXHORTATION TO RELATIVE DUTIES. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> Though Christiani<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/5-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Wives,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(gynaikes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1135.htm">Strong's 1135: </a> </span><span class="str2">A woman, wife, my lady.
