The "He" refers to Christ, who, after His ascension, distributed gifts to His followers. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7-10</a>, where Paul discusses Christ's authority to give gifts. The giving of these roles is an act of grace and sovereignty, highlighting that these positions are not self-appointed but divinely ordained.<p><b>some to be apostles</b><br>Apostles were foundational to the early church, serving as Christ's messengers and witnesses to His resurrection. The term "apostle" means "one who is sent out." The original apostles were chosen by Jesus, including Paul, who was called later. Their role was to establish churches and provide authoritative teaching. This office is closely linked to the New Testament's formation, as many apostles contributed to its writings.<p><b>some to be prophets</b><br>Prophets in the New Testament context were those who received direct revelation from God to edify, exhort, and comfort the church. This role is seen as a continuation of the Old Testament prophetic tradition, though with a focus on the church's edification. Prophets played a crucial role in the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-28 and 21</a>:10-11, where they provided guidance and warnings.<p><b>some to be evangelists</b><br>Evangelists are those specially gifted to proclaim the gospel and bring others to faith in Christ. This role is exemplified by figures like Philip in <a href="/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>, who traveled to spread the good news. Evangelists are essential for the church's growth and expansion, focusing on outreach and conversion.<p><b>and some to be pastors and teachers</b><br>The roles of pastors and teachers are often linked, suggesting a dual function of shepherding and instructing the church. Pastors, or shepherds, are responsible for the spiritual care and guidance of the congregation, akin to the shepherd imagery used throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>). Teachers are tasked with explaining and applying biblical doctrine, ensuring the church's doctrinal soundness. This dual role is vital for nurturing and equipping believers for service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostles.htm">Apostles</a></b><br>These were the foundational leaders in the early church, chosen by Christ to spread the Gospel and establish churches.

The word "gave," instead of the more obvious word <span class= "ital">set, </span>or <span class= "ital">appointed</span> (used in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>), is, of course, suggested by <a href="/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a>. They who are ministers of His gifts are themselves gifts from Him to the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles; and some, prophets . . .</span>--With this passage we must compare <a href="/1_corinthians/12-28.htm" title="And God has set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.">1Corinthians 12:28</a>, "God hath set some in the Church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings," &c.; and, perhaps, <a href="/context/romans/12-6.htm" title="Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;">Romans 12:6-8</a>, "Having then gifts . . . whether prophecy . . . or ministry . . . or teaching . . . or exhortation . . .," although this last passage is lass formally apposite. In all three cases there is the same general idea, first of the one body, and then of the one Spirit, guiding and animating it through various ministries. The parallel between this passage and the passage in 1 Cor. is very close; for in the latter all that follows the words "after that" may be put aside, as describing, not special offices or ministries, but special gifts. We have, therefore, in both, "first apostles, secondly prophets." Then come, in the earlier Epistle, "teachers;" and this class, in our own later Epistle, is subdivided into "evangelists" and "pastors," both being teachers--the one in conversion of those still aliens from Christ, the other in edification of those already brought into His flock.<p><span class= "bld">Some, apostles.</span>--The name "apostles" is certainly used here in its technical and restricted sense, as applying to the Twelve, whom "the Apostle" of God Himself (<a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>) named as His Apostles (<a href="/luke/6-13.htm" title="And when it was day, he called to him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;">Luke 6:13</a>), and with whom St. Paul claims equality (see <a href="/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1Corinthians 15:9-11</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) on the ground of his own special mission and revelation from the same Lord. It is, indeed, used in a wider sense; sometimes with words distinctly implying a derivation and human mission, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/8-23.htm" title="Whether any do inquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellow helper concerning you: or our brothers be inquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.">2Corinthians 8:23</a>, "apostles (or, <span class= "ital">messengers</span>) of the churches;" <a href="/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Philippians 2:25</a>, "Epaphroditus, your apostle (or, <span class= "ital">messenger</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span>" sometimes without such qualification, as in <a href="/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="/context/2_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.">2Corinthians 12:11-12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherishes her children:">1Thessalonians 2:7</a>; and, perhaps, <a href="/romans/16-7.htm" title="Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.">Romans 16:7</a>. But such use is rare, and cannot be applied to a passage like this, which is distinctive of a special and primary class. In direct charge from the Lord, universal scope of mission, special inspiration and power of miracle, which are "the signs of an apostle" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2Corinthians 12:12</a>), the Apostles, properly so called, stood out in office absolutely unique and supreme. What was said of the first age of the Church is true of all ages--"of the rest durst no man join himself unto them" (<a href="/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ephesians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gave some (to be) apostles.</span> Coming back to the diversity of gifts (ver. 7), He enumerates some of these, as Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">he</span>, emphatic) bestowed them. The organization of the Church is not a mere human arrangement; its officers are of Divine appointment. The first gift is, his apostles. It is not meant that he gave to some the gifts needed to constitute them apostles, though that is true; but that, having qualified some to be apostles, he gave them to the Church. An apostle had his commission direct from Christ (<a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5</a>); he possessed supernatural gifts (<a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>); it was necessary for him to have seen the Lord (<a href="/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>); his diocese was the whole world (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>). The apostles were the constituent body of the Church - they had all necessary gifts for setting it up, and as all Christian history has testified, they were a marvelous gift of Christ to his Church. <span class="cmt_word">And some, prophets.</span> Next to the apostles in point of value, as gifts to the Church, having supernatural knowledge of God's will present and future (<a href="/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>). Prophets were indispensable before the New Testament was given as the Church's infallible guide to the will of God, but not apparently necessary after the will of God was fully recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And some, evangelists.</span> The nature of this office is known only from the meaning of the term and the work of those who bore the designation (<a href="/acts/21-8.htm">Acts 21:8</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>) - persons not attached to a particular congregation, but who went about preaching the glad tidings, and otherwise building up the Church, but without the full powers of apostles. <span class="cmt_word">And some, pastors and teachers.</span> The more ordinary settled ministers of congregations, called pastors, because they watched over the flock, trying to lead all in right ways; and teachers, because they communicated Divine knowledge. Some have thought that each expression denotes a separate office, but, coupled as they are together, it is better to regard them as indicating two functions of one office (see <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <a href="/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ephesians/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[it was] He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
