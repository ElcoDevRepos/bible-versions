In the context of 2 Peter, these individuals were misleading believers by offering a form of freedom that was contrary to the true freedom found in Christ. This echoes the deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where the serpent promised Eve freedom through knowledge, leading to bondage instead. The promise of freedom without the constraints of God's moral law is a recurring theme in Scripture, often leading to spiritual and moral decay.<p><b>while they themselves are slaves to depravity</b><br>The false teachers are described as being enslaved to their own sinful desires. This reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to bondage, as seen in <a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>, where Jesus states, "Everyone who sins is a slave to sin." The term "depravity" suggests a deep moral corruption, indicating that these individuals are not only deceiving others but are also deeply entangled in their own sinful behaviors. This serves as a warning to believers to discern the character and teachings of those who claim to lead them.<p><b>For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of spiritual servitude, where one's master is determined by what controls their life. <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a> elaborates on this concept, explaining that individuals are either slaves to sin, which leads to death, or slaves to obedience, which leads to righteousness. The idea of mastery here is crucial, as it points to the ultimate authority in a person's life. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the choice between serving God or serving worldly desires, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where the Israelites are urged to choose whom they will serve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, addressing false teachings and moral corruption within the early Christian communities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the church who promise freedom but are themselves enslaved by sin and corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, who are being warned against the influence of false teachers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/corruption.htm">Corruption</a></b><br>The moral and spiritual decay that results from sin, which enslaves those who indulge in it.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/freedom.htm">Freedom</a></b><br>The concept being falsely promised by the false teachers, which is contrasted with true freedom in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_teaching.htm">Discernment in Teaching</a></b><br>Be vigilant about the teachings you accept.

The doctrines of Simon Magus, as reported by Irenaeus (I., chap. xxiii. 3) and by Hippolytus (<span class= "ital">Refut.</span> VI., chap. xiv.), show us the kind of liberty that such teachers promised--being "freed from righteousness" to become "the slaves of sin."<p><span class= "bld">Servants of corruption.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">bond-servants, </span>or <span class= "ital">slaves of corruption.</span> Our translators have often done well in translating the Greek word for "slave" by "servant" (see Note on <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2Peter 1:1</a>), but here the full force of the ignominious term should be given. Tyndale, Cranmer, and Geneva have "bond-servants;" Rheims "slaves." (Comp.

Liberty was the subject of their great swelling words of vanity; they talked loudly, made a great boast, about liberty. Perhaps they were wresting to their own destruction (comp. <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15, 16</a>) the teaching of St. Paul concerning Christian liberty. St. Paul had spoken of the liberty of the glory of the children of God (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>); he had again and again asserted the liberty of Christians in things indifferent (see <a href="/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-9.htm">1 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>, etc.). But he had insisted on the paramount duty of giving no offence (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>, etc.), and had earnestly cautioned his converts to "use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh." There were false teachers who maintained that the true Gnostic was free from moral restraints, in fact, that liberty meant libertinism, liberty to sin (comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>). They themselves are the servants of corruption. The construction is still participial, "being" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) being from the beginning servants of corruption. Those who talked about liberty were themselves all the time the bondservants, the slaves, of corruption. The word rendered "corruption" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="accented">in</span>cludes the sense of" destruction," as in verse 12 and <a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.</span> "Of whom," or "by whatever;" by Satan, the personal tempter, or by sin, the innate tendency; the Greek word will bear either meaning. Some good manuscripts add "also," which strengthens the assertion; "is he also brought in bondage." St. Peter's teaching corresponds exactly with that of St. Paul in <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>. There is a very close parallel to this clause in the 'Clementine Recognitions' (5:12; quoted by Dr. Salmon, in his 'Historical Introduction to the Books of the New Testament'): "unusquisque illius fit servus cui se ipse subjecerit." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They promise</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(epangellomenoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1861.htm">Strong's 1861: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and the base of aggelos; to announce upon, i.e. to engage to do something, to assert something respecting oneself.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
