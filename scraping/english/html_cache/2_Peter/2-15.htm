In biblical terms, the "straight way" often refers to the path of obedience to God's commandments and teachings. <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26-27</a> advises believers to keep their feet from evil and stay on the path of righteousness. The imagery of a "straight way" is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, where the way is prepared for the Lord, symbolizing a life aligned with God's will.<p><b>and wandered off</b><br>"Wandered off" suggests a gradual and perhaps careless deviation from the truth. This can be seen as a warning against spiritual complacency and the dangers of being led astray by false teachings. <a href="/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> warns believers to pay careful attention to what they have heard, so they do not drift away. The concept of wandering is also reminiscent of the Israelites' 40 years in the wilderness, a period marked by disobedience and lack of faith.<p><b>to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor</b><br>Balaam, a prophet mentioned in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>, is a complex figure who is known for his interactions with Balak, the king of Moab. Despite being a prophet, Balaam is criticized for his willingness to curse Israel for financial gain. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of compromising one's integrity for personal benefit. Balaam's actions are condemned in other parts of the New Testament, such as <a href="/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a> and <a href="/revelation/2-14.htm">Revelation 2:14</a>, where his name becomes synonymous with leading others into sin.<p><b>who loved the wages of wickedness</b><br>This phrase highlights Balaam's motivation&#8212;his love for material gain over obedience to God. The "wages of wickedness" refers to the rewards or benefits gained through unrighteous actions. This is a direct contrast to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The love of money and material wealth is frequently warned against in scripture, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.

Comp. <a href="/numbers/22-32.htm">Numbers 22:32</a>, where the angel of the Lord says of Balaam, "Thy way is perverse before me." The form "Bosor," instead of "Beor," arose probably from a peculiar (perhaps Galilaean) pronunciation of the guttural <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>. Thus we, perhaps, have here an undesigned coincidence, a slight confirmation of St. Peter's authorship: he was a Galilaean, and his speech betrayed him (<a href="/matthew/26-73.htm">Matthew 26:73</a>); one characteristic of the Galilaean dialect was a mispronunciation of the gutturals. But some commentators see in the resemblance of the form "Bosor" to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, flesh, an allusion to those sins of the flesh into which Balaam allured the Israelites. Compare the Jewish use of such names as <span class="accented">Ishbosheth</span> in derision for <span class="accented">Eshbaal</span> ("the man of shame" for "the man of Baal"), and <span class="accented">Jerubbesheth</span> (<a href="/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>) for <span class="accented">Jerubbaal.</span> The references to Balaam here, in St. Jude, the Book of the Revelation, and <a href="/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>, show that his history had made a great impression on the mind of thoughtful Christians. St. John connects his name with the Nicolaitanes in <a href="/revelation/2-15.htm">Revelation 2:15</a>, much as St. Peter here connects it with the false teachers of his time. Some, again, see in the etymology of the word "Nicolaitane" an allusion to that of "Balaam," as if the Nicolaitanes were followers of Balaam. There is another explanation in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the word "Bosor" is an Aramaic form, and that "the form possibly became familiar to St. Peter during his residence at Babylon, and suggests the probability that Aramaic traditions were still current respecting Balaam at the Christian era, and on the banks of the Euphrates" (additional note on Numbers 22:5). But the two oldest manuscripts read "Beer" here. Who loved the wages of unrighteousness (comp. verse 13, and also St. Peter's words in <a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>). Balaam is not definitely accused of covetousness in the Old Testament narrative; but his conduct can be explained by no other motive. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They have left</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Katalipontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2641.htm">Strong's 2641: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and leipo; to leave down, i.e. Behind; by implication, to abandon, have remaining.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] straight</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#952;&#949;&#8150;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eutheian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2117.htm">Strong's 2117: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps from eu and tithemi; straight, i.e. level, or true; adverbially at once.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">way</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;&#948;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hodon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3598.htm">Strong's 3598: </a> </span><span class="str2">A way, road, journey, path.
