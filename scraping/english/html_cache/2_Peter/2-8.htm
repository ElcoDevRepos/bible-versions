His righteousness is highlighted in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where he shows hospitality to the angels. Lot's righteousness is not due to his own merit but is attributed to his faith and relationship with God, similar to how righteousness is imputed to believers through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>).<p><b>living among them day after day</b><br>Lot's continuous residence in Sodom underscores the persistent exposure to the city's sinful environment. This phrase highlights the challenge of maintaining righteousness while being surrounded by pervasive wickedness. It serves as a reminder of the Christian call to be in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). Lot's situation is a cautionary tale about the dangers of becoming desensitized to sin through constant exposure.<p><b>was tormented in his righteous soul</b><br>The torment Lot experienced is indicative of the inner conflict and distress caused by witnessing sin and injustice. This reflects the struggle of believers who are grieved by the moral decay around them. The Greek word for "tormented" suggests a deep, ongoing anguish, similar to the groaning of creation awaiting redemption (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22-23</a>). It emphasizes the sensitivity of a righteous soul to sin.<p><b>by the lawless deeds</b><br>The lawlessness of Sodom and Gomorrah is well-documented in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the inhabitants' actions are described as exceedingly wicked. This lawlessness is a direct affront to God's holiness and order. The term "lawless" is often used in Scripture to describe rebellion against God's commandments, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>. It serves as a warning of the consequences of living in defiance of divine law.<p><b>he saw and heard</b><br>Lot's exposure to the sinfulness of Sodom was both visual and auditory, indicating the pervasive nature of the city's corruption. This dual exposure suggests that Lot was constantly confronted with the reality of sin, which is reminiscent of the believer's experience in a fallen world. The phrase underscores the importance of guarding one's heart and mind against the influence of sin (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).

But "righteous is a relative term; and in this case we must look at Lot both in comparison with the defective morality of the age and also with the licentiousness of those with whom he is here contrasted. Moreover, in the midst of this corruption he preserves some of the brighter features of his purer nomad life, especially that "chivalrous hospitality" (<a href="/context/genesis/19-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and you shall rise up early, and go on your ways.

Add to this the fact of God's rescuing him and his family, especially in connexion with the declaration that ten "righteous" people would have saved the whole city (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm" title="And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.">Genesis 18:32</a>), and his ready belief and obedience when told to leave all, and also the fact that Zoar was saved at his intercession (<a href="/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a>), and we must then admit that the epithet "righteous" as applied to Lot is by no means without warrant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For that righteous man dwelling among them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for the righteous man.</span> It was through his own choice that he dwelt among the people of Sodom. The recollection of this grave mistake must have added bitterness to the daily distress caused by the sins of his neighbours (<a href="/genesis/13-11.htm">Genesis 13:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.</span> The words, "in seeing and hearing," are best connected with the verb that follows, not with "righteous" according to the Vulgate (though this would be the natural connection, if with the Vatican Manuscript we omit the article), nor with "dwelling among them." The literal translation is, "was tormenting his righteous soul." The sight of lawless deeds and the sound of wicked words were a daily grief to Lot. He distressed himself; he felt the guilt and danger of his neighbours, the dishonour done to God, and his own unhappy choice. St. Peter cannot mean (as OEcumenius and Theophylact suppose) that Lot's affliction was caused by the sustained effort to resist the temptation of falling into the like vices himself. The Greek words for "seeing" and "dwelling among" occur only here in the New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">(for</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
