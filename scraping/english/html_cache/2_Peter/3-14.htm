This affectionate address is common in the New Testament, reflecting the familial bond among believers (1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). The "therefore" connects this verse to the preceding discussion about the Day of the Lord and the promise of new heavens and a new earth (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>).<p><b>as you anticipate these things</b><br>"These things" refers to the events surrounding the return of Christ and the end times, as described earlier in the chapter. The anticipation of these events is a call to live in a state of readiness and expectation, similar to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>. This anticipation is not passive but involves active preparation and vigilance.<p><b>make every effort</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of diligence and intentionality in the Christian life. It echoes Peter's earlier exhortation in <a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-7</a> to add to one's faith virtues such as goodness, knowledge, and self-control. The Christian life requires effort and perseverance, aligning with Paul's encouragement in <a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a> to "work out your salvation with fear and trembling."<p><b>to be found at peace</b><br>Being "at peace" suggests a state of spiritual tranquility and harmony with God, oneself, and others. This peace is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is rooted in the reconciliation achieved through Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>). It also implies readiness for Christ's return, as peace with God is essential for standing before Him.<p><b>spotless and blameless</b><br>These terms describe the moral and spiritual purity expected of believers. "Spotless" and "blameless" are often used in sacrificial language, referring to the unblemished animals required for offerings (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). In the New Testament, Christ is described as the "lamb without blemish or defect" (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>), and believers are called to emulate His purity. This call to holiness is consistent with the exhortation in <a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a> for the church to be presented to Christ as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle.<p><b>in His sight</b><br>This phrase emphasizes accountability to God, who sees and knows all (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). Living "in His sight" means living with an awareness of God's presence and judgment. It is a reminder that the ultimate evaluation of one's life is not based on human standards but on God's righteous judgment. This aligns with the call in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-9.htm">2 Corinthians 5:9-10</a> to make it our goal to please Him, for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, who is writing to encourage and instruct believers in their faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beloved.htm">Beloved</a></b><br>Refers to the recipients of the letter, the early Christian believers, whom Peter addresses with affection and concern.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the Lord</a></b><br>An eschatological event anticipated by Christians, involving the return of Christ and the final judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge and the one with whom believers are to be at peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church.htm">The Church</a></b><br>The collective body of believers who are called to live holy and blameless lives in anticipation of Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/anticipation_of_christ's_return.htm">Anticipation of Christ's Return</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in a state of readiness, eagerly anticipating the return of Christ.

The pair of epithets, "spotless and blameless," should be noticed as coinciding with <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>, and also as forming a marked contrast to the false teachers, who are called "spots and blemishes" (<a href="/2_peter/2-13.htm" title="And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;">2Peter 2:13</a>). "In peace" cannot well refer to differences between Jewish and Gentile Christians, a subject quite foreign to this Epistle. It may possibly refer to the false teachers and the discord caused by them; but more probably it has no special reference. It expresses at once the condition and the consequence of being "spotless and blameless." "There is no peace, saith my God, for the wicked."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things;</span> rather, <span class="accented">these things</span>, the coming of the Lord, the restitution of all things, the new heavens and the new earth. <span class="cmt_word">Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless;</span> literally, <span class="accented">give diligence</span> (or, <span class="accented">be earnest</span> - the same word which is used in <a href="/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>) <span class="accented">to be found without spot and blameless in his sight in</span> peace.
