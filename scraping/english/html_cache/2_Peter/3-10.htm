This concept is found in both the Old and New Testaments (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>). The imagery of a "thief" suggests suddenness and unexpectedness, emphasizing the need for constant readiness and vigilance among believers. This metaphor is also used by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43-44</a> and by Paul in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-4</a>, underscoring the unpredictability of this event.<p><b>The heavens will disappear with a roar,</b><br>The "heavens" here likely refer to the sky or the celestial realm, which in biblical cosmology is often seen as the abode of God and the angels. The "roar" suggests a cataclysmic event, possibly indicating the immense power and noise associated with the transformation or dissolution of the current order. This aligns with prophetic imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a> and <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>, where the heavens are described as being rolled up or vanishing.<p><b>the elements will be destroyed by fire,</b><br>The "elements" could refer to the basic components of the physical universe, such as earth, air, fire, and water, or possibly the heavenly bodies like the sun, moon, and stars. The destruction "by fire" is a common biblical motif for purification and judgment (e.g., <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>). Fire symbolizes God's holiness and the purging of sin, as seen in the refining process of metals. This imagery connects to the final judgment and the renewal of creation described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>.<p><b>and the earth and its works will be laid bare.</b><br>The "earth and its works" refers to the physical world and human achievements, which will be exposed and judged by God. The phrase "laid bare" suggests a revealing or uncovering, indicating that nothing will be hidden from God's sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This aligns with the theme of divine judgment where all deeds, good or evil, are brought to light (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).

The words are an echo of <a href="/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>, a saying which St. Peter certainly heard (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>), or possibly of <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm" title="For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.">1Thessalonians 5:2</a>, which may easily be included in the Epistles referred to below in <a href="/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2Peter 3:16</a>.

This repeated reproduction of words and ideas from one of the most impressive of Christ's discourses, which only St. Peter and three others seem to have heard, may fairly be added to the evidence in favour of the authenticity of the Epistle. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the day of the Lord will come.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, will come, stands emphatically at the beginning of the clause; whatever the mockers may say, whatever may happen, come certainly will the day of the Lord. "The day of the Lord" meets us often in the prophets; it is usually associated with the thought of judgment (see <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>; <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2</a>). In the New Testament it signifies the second advent of Christ (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a thief in the night.</span> The best manuscripts omit here "in the night." St. Peter is evidently echoing the Lord's words in that great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives, which must have made such a deep impression upon the apostles. This illustration of the sudden coming of the thief is repeated not only by St. Peter here, but also by St. Paul (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>), and twice by St. John (<a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a> and Revelation 16:15). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise.</span> The Greek for "with a great noise (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, and is one of those remarkable poetic forms which are not unfrequent in this Epistle: the noun <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used of the whizzing of arrows, of the rush of wings, of the sound of mighty winds or roaring waters. It may be understood here of the crash of a falling world or of the roar of the destroying flames. The word rendered "pass away" is that used by our Lord in the prophecy just referred to (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>; also in <a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a> and in <a href="/luke/16-17.htm">Luke 16:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the elements shall melt with fervent heat.</span> It is uncertain whether by "the elements" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) St. Peter means the four elements (in the old and popular use of the word), or the great constituent parts of the universe, the heavenly bodies. Against the first view is the assertion that one of those elements is to be the agent of destruction. But the word rendered "melt" means "shall be dissolved" or "loosed;" and it may be, as Bishop Wordsworth says, that "St. Peter's meaning seems to be that the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, elements or rudiments, of which the universe is composed and compacted, will be loosed; that is, the framework of the world will be disorganized; and this is the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in the LXX. (Wisd. 7:17 Wisd. 19:17) and in Hippolytus, 'Philos.,' pages 219, 318. The dissolution is contrasted with the consistency described by the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in verse 5. The heavens are reserved for fire, and will pass away with a rushing noise, and, being set on fire, will be dissolved; the elements will be on fire and melt, and he reduced to a state of confusion; the earth and the works therein will be burnt up. There does not seem, therefore, to be any cause for abandoning the common meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, the elemental principles of which the universe is made." On the other hand, the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly used of the heavenly bodies by Justin Martyr ('Apolog.,' 2. c. 5, and 'Dial. cum Tryphon,' c. 23); and the heavenly bodies are constantly mentioned in the descriptions of the awful convulsions of the great day (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, etc.). The objection that the word does not bear this meaning elsewhere in Holy Scripture is of little weight, as this is the only place in which it has a physical sense. The literal translation of the clause is, "The elements, being scorched, shall be dissolved." The word for "being scorched" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only here and in verse 12; it is used by the Greek physicians of the burning heat of fever. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "shall be dissolved or loosened." <span class="cmt_word">The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</span> By "the works that are therein" St. Peter seems to mean all the works both of God and of man, "opera naturae et artis" (Bengel). There is a very remarkable reading here (supported by the Sinaitic and Vatican and another uncial manuscript), <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be discovered," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall be burned up." If we understand "the works that are therein" of man's works and actions, this reading will give a good sense (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, "Every man's work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is"). Or the clause may be regarded as interrogative, "Shall the earth and the works that are therein be found?" But the reading, "shall be burned up" is well supported, and suits the context best. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/3-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] day</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;&#956;&#941;&#961;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;mera)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2250.htm">Strong's 2250: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day, the period from sunrise to sunset. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of [the] Lord</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyriou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
