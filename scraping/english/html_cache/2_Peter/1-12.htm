The "these things" likely refer to the qualities and virtues listed earlier in the chapter (<a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-7</a>), which are essential for a fruitful Christian life. This reflects the pastoral concern of Peter, ensuring that believers remain steadfast in their faith. The use of "therefore" connects this reminder to the preceding verses, where Peter discusses the divine power and promises given to believers.<p><b>even though you know them</b><br>Peter acknowledges that his audience is already familiar with the teachings he is reiterating. This suggests a mature Christian community that has been well-instructed. The phrase underscores the necessity of continual reinforcement of spiritual truths, as human nature is prone to forgetfulness and distraction. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where God's commands are to be constantly taught and remembered.<p><b>and are established in the truth you now have</b><br>The term "established" indicates a firm foundation in the faith, suggesting that the recipients of the letter have a solid understanding and acceptance of the gospel. This reflects the early church's emphasis on doctrinal stability amidst false teachings, a theme prevalent in the epistle. The "truth you now have" points to the apostolic teaching and the gospel message, which is consistent with the truth revealed in Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).
