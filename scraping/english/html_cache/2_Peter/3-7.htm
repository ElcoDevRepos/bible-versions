Christ Himself, in a discourse which St. Peter heard (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>), had made the Flood a type of the Judgment (<a href="/context/matthew/24-37.htm" title="But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:37-39</a>). (See below on <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm" title="But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.">2Peter 3:10</a>.) "Unto fire," or "for fire," should perhaps be taken with "kept in store" rather than with "reserved." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the heavens and the earth, which are now;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the heavens which are now, and the earth.</span> The "now" does not refer, as some think, to any change wrought by the Flood, but distinguishes the present heavens and earth from the new heavens and new earth, which Christians are to look for (verse 13). By the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire. Several of the better manuscripts have "by his Word," which, on the whole, seems to give the best meaning. The reading in the text may, indeed, be understood in a similar sense, "by the same Word of God;" otherwise it would mean that the original word of creation determined also the duration of the world and the means of its destruction. The words rendered, "are kept in store," are, literally, "have been treasured (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>)" (comp. <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>). It seems better to take the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> ("with fire," or "for fire") with this verb rather than with the following, as in the Authorized Version. If we take the first meaning of the dative, the sense will be that the world has been stored <span class="accented">with</span> fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that it contains, stored up in its inner depths, the fire which is destined ultimately to destroy it. But the other view seems on the whole more probable; the heavens and the earth are stored up <span class="accented">for</span> fire or unto fire, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, with the purpose in the counsels of God of their ultimate destruction by fire. This is the clearest prophecy in Holy Scripture of the final conflagration of the universe; but comp. <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>.
