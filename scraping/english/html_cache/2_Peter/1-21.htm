In biblical context, prophecy is seen as a revelation from God, not a product of human will or desire. This aligns with the understanding that true prophecy is inspired by God, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>, where God puts His words in the prophet's mouth. Historically, false prophets often arose, claiming divine insight, but their messages were self-serving or misleading, as warned against in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>.<p><b>but men spoke from God</b><br>This indicates that the prophets were instruments through whom God communicated His messages. The prophets, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, were chosen by God to deliver His words to the people. This concept is supported by <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, which states that God reveals His plans to His servants, the prophets. The role of the prophet was not to express personal opinions but to convey God's truth, often calling people back to faithfulness and obedience.<p><b>as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit</b><br>The phrase "carried along" suggests a guiding force, indicating that the Holy Spirit directed the prophets in their speech and writings. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching of the Holy Spirit's role in inspiration, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>, which states that all Scripture is God-breathed. The imagery of being "carried along" can be likened to a ship moved by the wind, suggesting that the prophets were moved by the Spirit's power, ensuring the accuracy and divine authority of their messages. This also prefigures the work of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, guiding the apostles and early church in truth, as promised by Jesus in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Peter rules that possibility out for authentic Scripture.<p>- Paul echoes the same thought about the gospel, insisting it is &#8220;not according to man&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>).<p>- Because its source is above us, prophecy remains wholly trustworthy; it is untainted by the limitations, biases, or errors that mark ordinary human speech.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but men spoke from God</b><p>- God chose to use people&#8212;real personalities with vocabularies, experiences, and styles&#8212;yet the origin of every prophetic message was God Himself.<p>- Moses heard, &#8220;I will be with your mouth and teach you what you shall say&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>). Centuries later David could testify, &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; His word was on my tongue&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>).<p>- Hebrews reminds us, &#8220;In the past God spoke to our fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>).<p>- The human authors were not passive scribes, but neither were they autonomous thinkers generating religious ideas; they were God&#8217;s chosen mouthpieces.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit</b><p>- The same Spirit who hovered over the waters of creation (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) hovered over the writers of Scripture, guiding every word so that what they penned was exactly what He intended.<p>- Luke records that &#8220;the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>), underscoring this divine supervision.<p>- Jesus promised, &#8220;When He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>). That promise was realized in the prophetic and apostolic writings.<p>- Picture a ship&#8217;s sail filled with wind: the sailors participate, yet the wind supplies the power and direction. Likewise, the prophets were &#8220;carried along,&#8221; ensuring infallible revelation without suppressing their individuality.<p>- Paul describes the process: &#8220;We speak... words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a> affirms that Scripture is not a human construct but a divine communication. Prophecy did not begin in the writer&#8217;s heart; it began in God&#8217;s. Yet God graciously used human voices, safeguarding every syllable through the Holy Spirit. The verse anchors our confidence that the Bible is fully reliable, perfectly truthful, and eternally authoritative&#8212;God&#8217;s Word delivered through faithful servants, borne along by His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For the prophecy came not in old time.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">For prophecy was never sent, </span>or <span class= "ital">brought.</span> Wiclif and Rheims alone have "brought"; all the rest "came." The verb is the same as that used of the voice from heaven (<a href="/context/2_peter/1-17.htm" title="For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">2Peter 1:17-18</a>), and also in this verse for "moved," so that there is a telling antithesis, difficult to preserve in English. Prophecy was not brought in by men; but men were brought to utter it by the Spirit. (Comp. <a href="/2_john/1-10.htm" title="If there come any to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:">2John 1:10</a>.) The rendering in the margin is right--"not <span class= "ital">at any time</span>" rather than "not <span class= "ital">in old time.</span>" "Not at any time"--"never," which both Tyndale and Cranmer have; Wiclif has "not ony time." The erroneous "in old time" comes from Geneva.<p><span class= "bld">But holy men of God . . .</span>--The Greek is uncertain. A reading of very high authority would give us, <span class= "ital">But men spoke from God moved by the Holy Ghost.</span> This is probably to be preferred. Men spoke not out of their own hearts, but as commissioned by God; not "by the will of man," but under the influence of the Holy Spirit. (Comp. St. Peter's speech at the election of Matthias, and again in Solomon's Porch, <a href="/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="/acts/3-18.htm" title="But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.">Acts 3:18</a>.) The word for "moved" is a strong one, meaning "borne along," as a ship before the wind (<a href="/context/acts/27-16.htm" title="And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:">Acts 27:16-17</a>). Theophilus of Antioch (<span class= "ital">Autolycus, </span>II. ix.) writes "men of God, moved (or, <span class= "ital">filled</span>) by the Holy Ghost, and becoming prophets, inspired and made wise by God Himself, became taught of God." Here, again, the parallel is too slight to be relied on as evidence that Theophilus was acquainted with this Epistle. (See above, third Note on <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>.) The same may be said of a passage in Hippolytus (<span class= "ital">Antichrist, </span>2), "These fathers were furnished with the Spirit and largely honoured by the Word Himself. . . . and when moved by Him the Prophets announced what God willed. For they spake not of their own power, neither did they declare what pleased themselves, &c. &c." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man;</span> literally, for <span class="accented">not by the will of man was prophecy borne at any time.</span> The verb is that already used in verses 17, 18, "was not borne or brought;" it refers not to the utterance of prophecy, but to its origin - it came from heaven. <span class="cmt_word">But holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but being borne on by the Holy Ghost, the holy men of God spake</span>; or, if we follow the Vatican Manuscript, "But being borne on by the Holy Ghost, men spake from God." We have again the same verb, "being borne on" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); comp. <a href="/acts/27-15.htm">Acts 27:15, 17</a>, where it is used of a ship being borne on by the wind. So the prophets were borne on in their prophetic utterance by the Holy Spirit of God. They were truly and really inspired. The mode of that inspiration is not explained; perhaps it cannot be made plain to our human understanding; all the points of contact between the finite and the Infinite are involved in mystery. But the fact is clearly revealed - the prophets were borne on by the Holy Spirit of God. This is not, as some have fancied, the language of Montanism. Prophecy is but a lamp shining in a dark place; it is not the day-star. Prophecy came not by the will of man; the prophets were moved or borne on by the Holy Ghost. But St. Peter does not say that their human consciousness was suspended, or that they were passive as the lyre when swept by the plectrum. Had this passage been written after the rise of Montanism early in the second century, the writer, if a Montanist, would have said more; if not a Montanist, he would have carefully guarded his words from possible misunderstanding. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
