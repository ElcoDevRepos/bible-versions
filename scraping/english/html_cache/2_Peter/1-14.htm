The apostle Peter is expressing a deep awareness and understanding of his situation. This knowledge is not speculative but assured, likely through divine revelation or spiritual insight. In the broader biblical context, this reflects the confidence that believers can have in God's promises and revelations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>, where Paul expresses a similar certainty in his faith.<p><b>that this tent</b><br>The term "tent" is a metaphor for the human body, emphasizing its temporary and transient nature. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, where Paul also uses the metaphor of a tent to describe the earthly body. The use of "tent" highlights the temporary nature of earthly life compared to the eternal life promised to believers. It reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites, who lived in tents during their wilderness journey, symbolizing the temporary nature of their earthly existence.<p><b>will soon be laid aside</b><br>This phrase suggests an impending event, specifically Peter's death. The language of "laid aside" implies a voluntary action, as if removing a garment, which aligns with the Christian understanding of death as a transition rather than an end. This reflects the early Christian belief in the resurrection and eternal life, where death is not feared but seen as a passage to be with Christ, as expressed in <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21-23</a>.<p><b>as our Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>Peter refers to Jesus with the titles "Lord" and "Christ," affirming His divine authority and messianic role. This acknowledgment of Jesus' lordship is central to Christian doctrine, as seen throughout the New Testament. The phrase underscores the personal relationship and direct communication Peter had with Jesus, which is foundational to his apostolic authority.<p><b>has made clear to me</b><br>This indicates that Peter received a specific revelation from Jesus regarding his death. This could refer to the prophecy Jesus gave Peter in <a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>, where Jesus foretold the manner of Peter's death, signifying the kind of death by which he would glorify God. This revelation underscores the prophetic nature of Jesus' ministry and His foreknowledge of future events, reinforcing His divine nature and the trustworthiness of His words.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, and a key leader in the early Christian church.

Both apostles saw personal knowledge from the Lord as an anchor, not presumption.<p>&#8226; The certainty Peter expresses invites readers to trust that Scripture speaks with the same clarity; what God says, He will do (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That This Tent Will Soon Be Laid Aside</b><p>The apostle calls his body a &#8220;tent,&#8221; highlighting its temporary nature.<p>&#8226; Paul uses the same imagery: &#8220;For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is dismantled, we have a building from God&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>). Earthly life is brief; heavenly life is permanent.<p>&#8226; A tent is functional but not meant for long-term residence. Peter&#8217;s choice of words reminds us we are pilgrims (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Soon&#8221; points to urgency. Like Paul, who wrote, &#8220;The time of my departure is at hand&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>), Peter senses death approaching and uses that awareness to spur diligent living (<a href="/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Laying aside the tent is not loss but transition. Jesus said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many rooms&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>). The contrast between a canvas shelter and a prepared mansion underscores hope beyond mortality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As Our Lord Jesus Christ Has Made Clear to Me</b><p>Peter roots his expectation in a direct word from Jesus.<p>&#8226; After breakfast by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus told Peter, &#8220;When you are old&#8230; someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go&#8221; (<a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18-19</a>). John adds, &#8220;Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Decades later, Peter still clings to that personal prophecy. Revelation from Christ is never outdated; it guides every season (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p>&#8226; His submission to that word models obedience. Instead of seeking to escape suffering, he embraces it, confident that martyrdom will glorify God (<a href="/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Knowing his end propels him to ensure that believers will &#8220;always be able to recall these things&#8221; after his departure (<a href="/2_peter/1-15.htm">2 Peter 1:15</a>), a reminder that personal legacy should advance the gospel, not personal ambition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Peter&#8217;s words blend certainty, urgency, and submission. He is sure (&#8220;I know&#8221;), aware of life&#8217;s brevity (&#8220;this tent will soon be laid aside&#8221;), and anchored in Christ&#8217;s personal revelation (&#8220;as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me&#8221;). The verse encourages believers to treat earthly life as temporary, trust fully in Jesus&#8217; promises, and steward every moment so that others are firmly grounded in the truth when our own tents are finally folded.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_peter/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle</span>.--This is rather wide of the mark.

The point is not that the writer believes himself to be near his end, but that his end would be such as to allow of no deathbed exhortations; what he has to say must be said in good time, for Christ had told him that his death would be a violent one (<a href="/john/21-18.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.">John 21:18</a>). Some of those who have taken the passage in the sense of the Authorised version have supposed a special revelation to be implied in the last half of the verse. But without any revelation an old man might know that his end must soon come; and Christ had already told him that it should come when he began to be old. "The putting off of my tabernacle" involves rather a mixture of metaphors; we have a similar mixture in <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>. The word for "putting off" occurs nowhere but here and <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1Peter 3:21</a>; but the coincidence is not one on which much stress can be laid.<p><span class= "bld">Hath shewed me.</span>--More strictly, <span class= "ital">shewed me.</span> The substitution of perfect for aorist is here objectionable, as it obscures the reference to a definite moment in the Apostle's life. If the reference were to <a href="/john/21-18.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.">John 21:18</a>, this would be at once fatal to the authenticity of our Epistle; for of course no part of St. John's Gospel, and least of all the last chapter, was written during the life of St. Peter. But if the reference be to the event <span class= "ital">narrated</span> in <a href="/john/21-18.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were young, you gird yourself, and walked where you would: but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not.">John 21:18</a>, then that narrative confirms what is said here, this being a prior and independent allusion to the same occurrence. In this case we have strong evidence of the authenticity of St. Peter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle;</span> literally, <span class="accented">knowing that swift is the putting off of my tabernacle.</span> St. Peter may mean by these words either that his death was near at hand, or that, when it came, it would be sudden, a violent death, not a lengthened illness. So Bengel, "Qui diu aegrotant, possunt altos adhuc pascere. Crux id Petro non erat permisura. Ideo prius agit quod agendum est."

Alford quotes Josephus, 'Ant.,' 4:08. 2, where Moses says, "Since I must depart from life, I have thought it right not even now to lay aside my zeal for your happiness." The word used here for "putting off" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is one of the links between the two Epistles; it occurs also in <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath showed me;</span> better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">signified unto me.</span> The aorist points to a definite time. St. Peter is thinking of our Lord's prophecy, which St. John afterwards recorded (<a href="/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>); he could never forget that touching interview; he had already referred to it once in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">since I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eid&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[it]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#954;&#951;&#957;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(sk&#275;n&#333;matos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4638.htm">Strong's 4638: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tent pitched, a dwelling, tabernacle.
