The sin of these angels is often linked to <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>, where "the sons of God" are interpreted by some as angels who took human wives, leading to the Nephilim. <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a> also references angels who did not keep their proper domain, suggesting a rebellion against God's order. This serves as a warning that even beings of great power and proximity to God are not exempt from His judgment.<p><b>but cast them deep into hell</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Tartarus," which in Greek mythology is a deep abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked. This is the only occurrence of this term in the New Testament, indicating a place of severe punishment. It emphasizes the severity of the angels' sin and the extent of God's judgment.<p><b>placing them in chains of darkness</b><br>This imagery of chains and darkness symbolizes the complete restraint and separation from God's light and presence. The "chains" suggest a binding that prevents any escape or further rebellion, while "darkness" often represents evil, judgment, and the absence of God's presence (see <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a> and <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>). This serves as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral consequences of their actions.<p><b>to be held for judgment</b><br>This indicates that the punishment of these angels is not yet complete but that they are being reserved for a future, final judgment. This aligns with <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where the ultimate judgment of Satan and his followers is described.

The third instance of God's vengeance is so prolonged by the addition respecting Lot, that the apodosis is wanting, the writer in his eagerness having lost the thread of the construction. The three instances here are in chronological order (wanton angels, Flood, Sodom and Gomorrha), while those in Jude are not (unbelievers in the wilderness, impure angels, Sodom and Gomorrha). Both arrangements are natural--this as being chronological, that of St. Jude for reasons stated in the Notes there. (See on <a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm" title="And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly;">2Peter 2:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The angels that sinned.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">the angels for their sin</span>: it gives the reason why they were not spared, and points to some definite sin. What sin is meant? Not that which preceded the history of the human race, commonly called the fall of the angels--of that there is no record in the Old Testament; and, moreover, it affords no close analogy to the conduct of the false teachers. St. Jude is somewhat more explicit (<a href="/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>); he says it was for not keeping their own dignity--for deserting their proper home; and the reference, both there and here, is either to a common interpretation of <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm" title="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a> (that by "the sons of God" are meant "angels"), or, more probably, to distinct and frequent statements in the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch, </span>that certain angels sinned by having intercourse with women--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Enoch vii. 1, 2; cv. 13 (Lawrence's translation). Not improbably these false teachers made use of this book, and possibly of these passages, in their corrupt teaching. Hence St. Peter uses it as an <span class= "ital">argumentum ad hominem</span> against them, and St. Jude, recognising the allusion, adopts it and makes it more plain; or both writers, knowing the <span class= "ital">Book of Enoch</span> well, and calculating on their readers knowing it also, used it to illustrate their arguments and exhortations, just as St. Paul uses the Jewish belief of the rock following the Israelites. (See Note on <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1Corinthians 10:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Cast them down to hell.</span>--The Greek word occurs nowhere else, but its meaning is plain--<span class= "ital">to cast down to Tartarus</span>; and though "Tartarus" occurs neither in the Old nor in the New Testament, it probably is the same as Gehenna. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if God spared not the angels that sinned;</span> rather, <span class="accented">angels when they sinned</span> ; there is no article. St. Peter is giving proofs of his assertion that the punishment of the ungodly lingereth not. The first is the punishment of angels that sinned. He does not specify the sin, whether rebellion, as in <a href="/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a>; or uncleanness, as apparently in <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6, 7</a>, and <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>. Formally, there is an anacoluthon here, but in thought we have the apodosis in verse 9. <span class="cmt_word">But cast them down to hell.</span> The Greek word, which is found nowhere else in the Greek Scriptures, is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having cast into Tartarus." This use of a word belonging to heathen mythology is very remarkable, and without parallel in the New Testament. (The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in the Septuagint, <a href="/job/40-15.htm">Job 40:15</a>. Compare also the Septuagint rendering of the name of Job's daughter Keren-Happuch, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the horn of Amalthaea; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>.) Apparently, St. Peter regards Tartarus not as equivalent to Gehenna, for the sinful angels are "reserved unto judgment," but as a place of preliminary detention. Josephus, quoted by Professor Lumby in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' speaks of the oldest heathen gods as fettered in Tartarus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ('Contra Apion,' 2:33). And delivered them into chains of darkness. The Revised Version "pits" represents the reading of the four oldest manuscripts; but the variations in two of them (the Sinaitic and Alexandrine have <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> seems properly to mean a pit for the storage of corn, throw some doubt upon this reading. The other reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, cords, may possibly have arisen from the parallel passage in <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, though the Greek word for "chains" is different there. The chains consist in darkness; the pits are in darkness, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, delivered, is often used, as Huther remarks, with the implied idea of punishment. It is simpler to connect the chains or pits of darkness with this verb than (as Fronmuller and others) with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "having cast them in bonds of darkness into Tartarus" (comp. Wisd. 17:2, 16, 17). To be reserved unto judgment; literally, <span class="accented">being reserved</span>; but the readings here are very confused. St. Jude says (verse 6) that the sinful angels are reserved <span class="accented">"unto</span> the judgment of the great day." Bengel says, "Possunt autem in terra quoque versari mancipia Tartari (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; etc.) sic ut bello captus etiam extra locum captivitatis potest ambulare." But in the case of a mystery of which so little has been revealed, we are scarcely justified in assuming the identity of the angels cast into Tartarus with the evil spirits who tempt and harass us on earth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
