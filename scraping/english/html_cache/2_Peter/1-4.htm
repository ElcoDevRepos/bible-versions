The "precious and magnificent promises" are the assurances given by God throughout Scripture, including the promise of eternal life (1 <a href="/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>) and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). These promises are rooted in the covenantal relationship God established with His people, beginning with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). The promises are described as "precious" and "magnificent" because they are invaluable and reflect God's glory and excellence.<p><b>so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature</b><br>The concept of becoming "partakers of the divine nature" is unique to this passage and suggests a profound transformation. It implies a sharing in God's moral attributes, such as holiness and love, which is made possible through the work of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). This transformation is a key aspect of sanctification, the process by which believers are conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>). The idea of partaking in the divine nature also echoes the creation narrative, where humans are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>), and points to the ultimate restoration of that image through Christ.<p><b>now that you have escaped the corruption in the world</b><br>This phrase highlights the believer's deliverance from the moral decay and spiritual death that characterize the fallen world. The "corruption" refers to the pervasive sin and moral degradation resulting from humanity's rebellion against God (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>). The escape from this corruption is made possible through faith in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from the domain of darkness (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>) and grants them new life (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This deliverance is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers await the full redemption of creation (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>).<p><b>caused by evil desires</b><br>"Evil desires" are the sinful inclinations and lusts that lead to moral corruption and separation from God. These desires are rooted in the fallen human nature and are contrasted with the desires of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-17</a>). The New Testament frequently warns against succumbing to these desires, urging believers to live by the Spirit and put to death the deeds of the flesh (<a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>). The transformation into partakers of the divine nature involves a continual battle against these desires, empowered by the Holy Spirit and guided by the Word of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Its termination indicates the things promised rather than the act of promising. They are "exceeding great," or rather "the greatest," because they contain an earnest of the completion and perfection of the Christian life; they are very "precious," because this earnest is in itself something real, and not mere empty words. Not the promises of the Old Testament are meant, that Christ should come; but those of the New Testament, that Christ should come again. The certainty of Christ's return to reward the righteous and punish the wicked is one of the main subjects of the Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">That by these.</span>--"These" is variously referred (1) to "all things that pertain unto life and godliness," (2) to "glory and virtue," (3) to "promises." The last is most likely, the second least likely to be right.

The change from the first person plural to the second is easy enough both in Greek and English: by it what is true of all Christians is applied specially to those whom the writer is addressing. We have a similar change in <a href="/context/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1Peter 2:24</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whereby he hath granted unto us h is precious and exceeding great promises.</span> Does the word "whereby" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "through which things") refer to the immediately preceding words, "glory and virtue"? or is its antecedent to be found in the more distant "all things which pertain unto life and godliness"? Both views are possible. God first granted unto us all things necessary for life and godliness; through those first gifts, duly used, he has granted unto us others more precious still. But it <span class="accented">seems</span> better to connect the relative with the nearer antecedent. It is through God's glory and virtue, through his glorious attributes and the energetic working of those attributes, that he has granted the promises. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) should be translated "hath granted," as in the preceding verse. The word for "promise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs <span class="accented">elsewhere</span> only in <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>; it means the thing promised, not the act of promising. The order of the words, "exceeding great and precious," is differently given in the manuscripts; on the whole, that adopted by the Revised Version seems the best supported. The article with the first word (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) has a possessive force, and is well rendered, "his precious promises." They are precious, because they will be certainly fulfilled in all their depth of blessed meaning, and because they are in part fulfilled at once (comp. <a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>, "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance"). The word "precious" reminds us of <a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 19</a>; the resemblance with <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> is apparent only, in the Authorized Version, not in the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">That by these ye might be partakers of the Divine nature;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that through these</span> (promises, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, through their fulfillment) <span class="accented">ye may beeome partakers.</span> It is true that the verb is aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), but it does not follow that, might be" is the right translation, or that the writer regarded the participation as having already taken place (comp. <a href="/john/12-36.htm">John 12:36</a>, "Believe in the light, that ye may be (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) the children of light"). As Alford says, the aorist seems to imply "that the aim was not the procedure, but the completion, of that indicated; not the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the carrying on the process, but the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, its accomplishment." The end of God's gift is the complete accomplishment of his gracious purpose, but it is only by continual growth that the Christian attains at length to that accomplishment. St. Peter's words seem very bold; but they do not go beyond many other statements of Holy Scripture. At the beginning God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." St. Paul tells us that believers are now "changed into the same image from glory to glory" (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>; comp. also <a href="/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-49.htm">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>, etc.). Christians, born of God (<a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>), are made "partakers of Christ" (<a href="/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>), "partakers of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>). Christ prayed for us that we might be "made perfect in one" with himself who is one with God the Father, through the indwelling presence of the Holy Ghost the Comforter (<a href="/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20-23</a>; <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17, 23</a>). The second person is used to imply that the promises made to all Christians (unto <span class="accented">us</span>) belong to those whom St. Peter now addresses. <span class="cmt_word">Having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust;</span> literally, <span class="accented">having escaped from the corruption that is in the world in lust.</span> These words express the negative side of the Christian life, the former clause describing its active and positive side. God's precious promises realized in the soul enable the Christian to become partakers of the Divine nature, and to escape from corruption; the two aspects of the Christian life must go on simultaneously; each implies and requires the other. Bengel says, "Haec fuga non tam ut officium nostrum, quam ut beneficium divinum, communionem cum Deo comitans, hoc loco ponitur." The verb used here (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs in the New Testament only in this Epistle. It reminds us of St. Paul's words in <a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>, "The creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption." The corruption or destruction (for the Word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> has both those meanings) from which we must escape has its seat and power in lust; working secretly in the lusts of men's wicked hearts, it manifests its evil presence in the world (comp. <a href="/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Through</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[these]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8039;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He has given</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#948;&#974;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(ded&#333;r&#275;tai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1433.htm">Strong's 1433: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, grant, donate.
