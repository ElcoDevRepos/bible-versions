This term is often used in the New Testament to address fellow believers, highlighting the familial bond within the Christian community (e.g., 1 <a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). The use of "therefore" connects this verse to the preceding discussion about the coming of the Lord and the need for holy conduct.<p><b>since you already know these things</b><br>Peter acknowledges that his readers are already aware of the truths he has been discussing, such as the return of Christ and the judgment of the ungodly. This suggests that the audience is familiar with apostolic teaching and the Old Testament prophecies concerning the end times. It reflects the importance of being reminded of spiritual truths to remain steadfast in faith (<a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12-15</a>).<p><b>be on your guard</b><br>This phrase is a call to vigilance and spiritual alertness. The New Testament frequently warns believers to be watchful against false teachings and moral corruption (e.g., <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4</a>). The imagery of a guard suggests a military or protective stance, indicating the seriousness of the threat posed by false teachers.<p><b>so that you will not be carried away by the error of the lawless</b><br>The "error of the lawless" refers to false teachings and immoral behaviors that deviate from the truth of the Gospel. The term "lawless" is often associated with those who reject God's commandments and live in rebellion (e.g., <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-8</a>). This warning echoes the broader biblical theme of the danger of apostasy and the need to adhere to sound doctrine (<a href="/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>).<p><b>and fall from your secure standing</b><br>The phrase "secure standing" implies a position of stability and assurance in one's faith. It suggests that believers have a firm foundation in Christ, but there is a real danger of falling away if they are not vigilant. This echoes the biblical teaching that perseverance in faith is necessary for salvation (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-14</a>). The warning serves as a reminder of the importance of remaining rooted in the truth and relying on God's grace to maintain one's spiritual position.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of this epistle, writing to encourage and warn believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beloved.htm">Beloved</a></b><br>Refers to the recipients of the letter, likely early Christians who are being reminded of their faith and the dangers of false teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lawless.htm">Lawless</a></b><br>Those who reject God's law and live in opposition to His commands, often leading others astray.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/secure_standing.htm">Secure Standing</a></b><br>The firm foundation of faith and salvation that believers have in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/error.htm">Error</a></b><br>The false teachings and deceptions that can lead believers away from the truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/be_vigilant.htm">Be Vigilant</a></b><br>As believers, we must remain alert and discerning, aware of the false teachings that can lead us astray.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_faith.htm">Guard Your Faith</a></b><br>Actively protect your faith by immersing yourself in Scripture and prayer, ensuring that your beliefs are rooted in truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognize_falsehood.htm">Recognize Falsehood</a></b><br>Develop the ability to identify and reject teachings that contradict the core tenets of Christianity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stand_firm_in_christ.htm">Stand Firm in Christ</a></b><br>Remember that our secure standing is in Christ alone, and we must rely on His strength to remain steadfast.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>Engage with fellow believers for mutual encouragement and accountability to help guard against falling away.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Peter_3_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Peter 3:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_error_of_the_lawless.htm">How can we guard against being "led away by the error of the lawless"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_falling_for_believers.htm">What does "falling from your secure position" mean in a believer's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_17_NT_warnings_link.htm">How does 2 Peter 3:17 connect with warnings in other New Testament letters?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_steadfast_in_faith_daily.htm">What practical steps help us remain steadfast in our faith daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Promote_vigilance_against_false_teachings.htm">How can we encourage others to remain vigilant against false teachings today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_17_s_warning_on_false_teachings.htm">How does 2 Peter 3:17 warn against being led astray by false teachings?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_2_Peter_3_17.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of 2 Peter 3:17?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Peter_3_17_and_spiritual_vigilance.htm">How does 2 Peter 3:17 relate to the concept of spiritual vigilance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_peter_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Peter 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_polycarp_of_smyrna.htm">Who was Polycarp of Smyrna?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_to_submit_to_authorities.htm">How does the Bible warn against deception?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_christians_handle_pet_loss.htm">What are the doctrines of demons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_the_bible_warn_of_deceit.htm">How does the Bible warn against deception?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Peter 3:17 Mean</div><b>Therefore, beloved</b><p>Peter&#8217;s &#8220;therefore&#8221; looks back to the coming day of the Lord (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10&#8211;14</a>).
