The term "corruption" is often associated with the sinful nature and practices that are contrary to God's will. In biblical context, the "world" refers to the system of values and behaviors that are opposed to God. This escape is reminiscent of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, symbolizing liberation from bondage. The concept of escaping corruption is also echoed in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are urged not to conform to the patterns of this world.<p><b>through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</b><br>The means of escape is through the "knowledge" of Jesus Christ, indicating a deep, personal, and transformative understanding of who He is and what He has done. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, involving a commitment to follow Christ. The titles "Lord" and "Savior" emphasize His authority and His role in salvation. This aligns with <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where eternal life is defined as knowing the only true God and Jesus Christ. The Greek word for knowledge, "epignosis," implies a full, experiential knowledge that leads to a change in behavior and perspective.<p><b>only to be entangled and overcome by it again</b><br>This phrase warns of the danger of returning to former sinful ways after having known Christ. The imagery of being "entangled" suggests being caught or trapped, similar to an animal in a net. This reflects the deceitful nature of sin, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which speaks of sin that easily entangles. The word "overcome" indicates a defeat, suggesting that the individuals have been overpowered by the very corruption they once escaped. This is a sobering reminder of the spiritual battle believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>.<p><b>their final condition is worse than it was at first</b><br>The final state of these individuals is described as worse than their initial condition, highlighting the severe consequences of apostasy. This echoes Jesus' warning in <a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43-45</a> about the unclean spirit returning to a person, making their last state worse than the first. The gravity of turning away after knowing the truth is also emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>, which speaks of the impossibility of renewing to repentance those who have fallen away.

(See above on <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2Peter 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-15.htm" title="And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given to him has written to you;">2Peter 3:15</a>; and below, <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2Peter 3:5</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Through the knowledge.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">in knowledge</span> the preposition "in" pointing to that in which the escape consists. (See on <a href="/2_peter/2-18.htm" title="For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.">2Peter 2:18</a>, and comp. <a href="/luke/1-77.htm" title="To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins,">Luke 1:77</a>.) The knowledge is of the same mature and complete kind as that spoken of in <a href="/context/2_peter/1-2.htm" title="Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,">2Peter 1:2-3</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-8.htm" title="For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:8</a> (where see Notes), showing that these <span class= "ital">men</span> were well-instructed Christians. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for if, having escaped</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). Is St. Peter in this verse still speaking of the false teachers, or of those whom they had enticed (verse 18)? Bengel, Fronmuller, and others take the latter view, thinking that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("those having escaped") of this verse must be the same with the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("those who are escaping," or "those having escaped") of verse 18. But it is far more natural to understand St, Peter as continuing his description of the false teachers. The conjunction "for" connects the clause closely with that immediately preceding, and suggests that St. Peter is explaining the term "bondservants or slaves" applied to the false teachers in verse 19; the repetition of the word "overcome" also seems to imply that the subjects of yore. 20 and 19 are the same. The word for" pollutions" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs only here. In 'Hermas' (Vis., 4:3, 2) there occurs what may be a reminiscence of this verse: "Ye who have escaped this world." Through the knowledge of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> and Saviour Jesus Christ. Several of the most ancient manuscripts read, "our Lord and Saviour." The word rendered "knowledge" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, full knowledge (comp. <a href="/2_peter/1-2.htm">2 Peter 1:2, 3, 8</a>; also <a href="/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>; <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). The preposition is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>. The full, personal knowledge of the Saviour is the sphere in which the Christian lives; while he abides in that knowledge grace and peace are multiplied unto him, and he is enabled to escape the pollutions of the world. The apostle warns us here that some of those who once enjoyed the blessedness of that sacred knowledge have been entangled in sin and have fallen from grace. They are again entangled therein, and overcome. The first clause is participial; the connection seems to be, "If, having escaped... but being again entangled they are overcome." The word "entangled" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) suggests the figure of fishes entangled in the meshes of a net, and seems to point back to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("entice") of verses 18 and 14; they entice others, but they are entangled themselves (comp. <a href="/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>), and become captives and slaves to the pollutions of the world from which they had once escaped. The latter end is worse with them than the beginning; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the last state is become worse with them than the first.</span> This is a distinct quotation of our Lord's words in <a href="/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a> and <a href="/luke/11-26.htm">Luke 11:26</a>. The evil spirit had been cast out from these men; for a time they had lived in the full knowledge of Christ; but now the evil spirit had returned, and had brought with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself. This spontaneous adoption of our Lord's words without marks of quotation is not like the work of a forger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_peter/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
