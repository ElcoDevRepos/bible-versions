The "corrupt desires of the flesh" refer to the sinful nature that opposes God's will, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>, which lists the works of the flesh. The concept of punishment reserved for such individuals echoes the warnings found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-32</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness. This serves as a reminder of the moral decay that results from turning away from God's truth.<p><b>and despise authority.</b><br>Despising authority indicates a rejection of God's established order, both divine and human. This rebellion against authority is reminiscent of the sin of Korah in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, where defiance against God's appointed leaders led to severe consequences. The New Testament also warns against such attitudes in <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>, where false teachers are described as rejecting authority. This reflects a broader biblical theme of the importance of submission to God's ordained structures, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>.<p><b>Bold and self-willed,</b><br>The description of being "bold and self-willed" characterizes individuals who act arrogantly and independently of God's guidance. This attitude is akin to the pride seen in Lucifer's rebellion in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>, where self-exaltation led to downfall. The Bible consistently warns against pride and self-reliance, as in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which states that pride goes before destruction. Such traits are antithetical to the humility exemplified by Christ, who submitted to the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>).<p><b>they are unafraid to slander glorious beings.</b><br>Slandering "glorious beings" likely refers to speaking against spiritual entities, possibly angels or other heavenly beings. This behavior reflects a lack of reverence and understanding of the spiritual realm. <a href="/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a> provides a parallel account where even the archangel Michael refrains from slandering Satan, instead saying, "The Lord rebuke you!"

"despise dominion," <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>.) Our version is minutely perverse. The word translated "government" here and "dominion" in Jude is one and the same in the Greek: whereas the words translated in both places "despise" are different.<p><span class= "bld">Presumptuous are they.</span>--A fresh verse should begin here; the construction is entirely changed, and a fresh start made. From "the unjust" to "government" the reference is to ungodly and sensual people in general; here we return to the false teachers in particular. <span class= "ital">Audacious</span> would be more literal than "presumptuous." The word is found here only. On the change to the present tense, see <span class= "ital">Introduction, </span>I., <span class= "ital">c, <span class= "greekheb"></span>.</span><p><span class= "bld">Speak evil of dignities.</span>--The exact meaning of "dignities," or "glories," is not clear, either here or in <a href="/jude/1-8.htm" title="Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.">Jude 1:8</a>. The context in both places seems to show that spiritual powers alone are intended, and that earthly powers, whether civil or ecclesiastical, are not included, much less exclusively indicated. The construction here resembles that in <a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a> : "Do not tremble in (or, <span class= "ital">while</span>) speaking evil of dignities," like "ye do well in taking heed." These men deny the existence of, or irreverently speak slightingly of, those spiritual agencies by means of which God conducts the government of the world. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the lust of pollution.</span> The word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but the corresponding verb is found in several places (<a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>). We observe that in this verse St. Peter passes from the future tense to the present. And despise government; rather, <span class="accented">lordship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). St. Jude has the same word in verse 8. In <a href="/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> it is used of angelic dignities. Here it seems to stand for all forms of authority. Presumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities; literally, <span class="accented">daring, self-willed, they tremble not when speaking evil of glories</span>; or, <span class="accented">they fear not glories, blaspheming.</span> The word rendered "daring" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. These daring, self-willed men despise all lordship, all glories, whether the glory of Christ ("the excellent glory," <a href="/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>), or the glory of the angels, or the glory of holiness, or the glory of earthly sovereignty. The next verse, however, makes it probable that the glory of the angels was the thought present to St. Peter's mind. It may be that, as some false teachers had inculcated the worship of angels (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>), others had gone to the opposite extreme (comp. <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>).
