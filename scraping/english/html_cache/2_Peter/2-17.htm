In the arid regions of the Middle East, a spring without water would be a profound disappointment, symbolizing emptiness and deceit. Biblically, water often represents life and truth (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>), and these false teachers lack the true substance of the Gospel. Their teachings are void of the life-giving truth found in Christ, similar to the barren fig tree that Jesus cursed for its lack of fruit (<a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>).<p><b>and mists driven by a storm</b><br>This imagery suggests instability and lack of direction. Mists, or clouds, driven by a storm are unpredictable and fleeting, much like the teachings of these false prophets. They may appear promising but are ultimately insubstantial and lead to confusion. This can be connected to <a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, where believers are warned against being "tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine." The storm represents the chaotic and destructive nature of their influence.<p><b>Blackest darkness is reserved for them</b><br>This phrase indicates the severe judgment awaiting false teachers. The "blackest darkness" symbolizes the ultimate separation from God, often associated with hell or eternal punishment (<a href="/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a>). This reflects the seriousness of leading others astray and the spiritual consequences of rejecting the truth of the Gospel. The imagery of darkness contrasts with the light of Christ, who is the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).

When cultural or personal pressures blow, they shift quickly, dragging followers with them.<p>&#8226; Jude again parallels Peter: &#8220;clouds without water, carried along by winds&#8221; (<a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 12</a>), stressing that their movement is aimless, not Spirit-led.<p>Key takeaway: truth stands firm; error drifts. A life grounded in Scripture withstands the storm (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blackest darkness is reserved for them</b><p>&#8220;Blackest darkness is reserved for them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Peter has already reminded us that God &#8220;did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). The same certain judgment awaits persistent falsehood.<p>&#8226; Jesus speaks of &#8220;outer darkness&#8221; for the unfaithful (<a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>; 8:12). This is not mere metaphor but the literal separation from God&#8217;s light.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 13</a> repeats the sentence almost word-for-word: &#8220;wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.&#8221; The Spirit inspired both writers to underline the irrevocable verdict.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a> describes the final destiny of the deceiver: &#8220;the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.&#8221;<p>Key takeaway: God&#8217;s patience has limits. While salvation remains available to all who repent, those who persist in leading others astray face certain, eternal darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Peter&#8217;s three vivid images expose the tragedy of false teachers: they promise refreshment yet leave dryness, they seem impressive yet blow away in the next gust, and they race toward an inescapable, dreadful judgment.

Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.">John 4:6</a>. These men are like dried-up watering-places in the desert, which entice and mock the thirsty traveller; perhaps leading him into danger also by drawing him from places where there is water. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.">Jeremiah 14:3</a>.) The parallel passage, <a href="/context/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12-13</a>, is much more full than the one before us, and is more like an amplification of this than this a condensation of that--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>would a simile so admirably suitable to false guides as "wandering stars" have been neglected by the writer of our Epistle? A Hebrew word which occurs only twice in the Old Testament is translated by the LXX. in the one place (<a href="/genesis/2-6.htm" title="But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.">Genesis 2:6</a>) by the word here used for "well," and in the other (<a href="/job/36-27.htm" title="For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof:">Job 36:27</a>) by the word used in <a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>, for "cloud." Thus the same Hebrew might have produced "wells without water" here and "clouds without water" in Jude. This is one of the arguments used in favour of a Hebrew original of both these Epistles. Coincidences of this kind, which may easily be mere accidents of language, must be shown to be numerous before a solid argument can be based upon them. Moreover, we must remember that the writers in both cases were Jews, writing in Greek, while thinking probably in Hebrew, so that the same Hebrew thought might suggest a different Greek expression in the two cases. When we have deducted all that might easily be accounted for in this way, and also all that is perhaps purely accidental, from the not very numerous instances of a similar kind that have been collected, we shall not find much on which to build the hypothesis of these Epistles being translations from Hebrew originals.

They are like wells without water; they deceive men with a promise which they do not fulfill. In <a href="/jude/1-12.htm">Jude 1:12</a> there is a slight difference - "clouds without water" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clouds that are carried with a tempest;</span> better, <span class="accented">mists driven by a tempest.</span> The best manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, mists, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, clouds; they are driven along by the tempest; they give no water to the thirsty land, but only bring darkness and obscurity. The Greek word for "tempest" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>) is used by St. Mark and St. Luke in their account of the tempest on the Sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the mist of darkness is reserved for over;</span> rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the blackness of darkness.</span> The words are the same as those of <a href="/jude/1-13.htm">Jude 1:13</a> (comp. verse 4 of this chapter; also <a href="/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; and <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, where the same verb is used of the inheritance <span class="accented">reserved</span> in heaven for the saints).
