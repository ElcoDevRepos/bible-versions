The imagery of sheep is significant in biblical literature, symbolizing vulnerability and the tendency to wander without guidance. In the ancient Near East, sheep were common and well-understood as animals that required constant oversight. This metaphor highlights the spiritual condition of humanity before coming to faith in Christ&#8212;lost and in need of direction. The use of "going astray" reflects the sinful nature and the propensity to deviate from God's path, echoing the fall of man and the need for redemption.<p><b>but now you have returned</b><br>The concept of returning implies repentance and a change of direction. In the New Testament, repentance is a central theme, calling believers to turn away from sin and back to God. This return is not merely a physical or emotional change but a spiritual transformation. The Greek word used here for "returned" suggests a complete turning around, indicating a decisive action taken by the believer. This aligns with the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the son returns to the father, symbolizing repentance and restoration.<p><b>to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</b><br>The titles "Shepherd" and "Overseer" are rich with meaning. "Shepherd" is a title frequently used for Jesus, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where He declares, "I am the good shepherd." This title emphasizes His role in guiding, protecting, and caring for His flock. The shepherd imagery is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, with figures like David, a shepherd-king, prefiguring Christ. "Overseer" (or "Bishop" in some translations) denotes authority and responsibility, suggesting Christ's role in watching over and guiding the spiritual well-being of believers. This dual role underscores His comprehensive care and leadership, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>, where God promises to set up one shepherd over His people. The combination of these titles assures believers of Christ's intimate involvement in their lives, providing both guidance and oversight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The author of the epistle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his leadership in the early church and his close relationship with Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>A metaphor for believers, highlighting their tendency to wander and their need for guidance and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd.htm">Shepherd</a></b><br>A title for Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role in guiding, protecting, and caring for His followers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/overseer.htm">Overseer</a></b><br>Another title for Jesus, indicating His authority and responsibility over the spiritual well-being of believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The initial audience of Peter's letter, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians facing persecution and needing encouragement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_humanity.htm">The Nature of Humanity</a></b><br>Like sheep, humans have a natural tendency to wander away from God.

The "for" introduces an explanation of how they came to be in need of "healing." "I may well say that ye were healed; for Israelites though you are, your consciences and memories tell you that you were as far gone in wilful error as any Gentiles, and needed as complete a conversion." (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>.) Jew and Gentile take different ways, but both alike fulfil the prophecy, "every man to his own way." The two metaphors, of healing and going astray, do not match very well, but the fact that both are quotations from Isaiah 53 makes their disagreement less harsh. We must notice how deeply that prophecy (the interpretation of which was probably learned from the Baptist) had sunk into St. Peter's mind. (See <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But are now returned.</span>--The tense of the original verb points to the actual historical time at which it took place, rather than the position now occupied, "but now ye returned." The word "now" is used in the same way in <a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm" title="Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.">1Peter 2:10</a>, where literally it is, "but now <span class= "ital">did</span> obtain mercy." "Returned" does not in the Greek imply that they had at first been under the Shepherd's care and had left Him. The word is that which is often rendered "were converted," and only indicates that they turned round and moved in a contrary direction.<p><span class= "bld">The shepherd and bishop of your souls.</span>--Undoubtedly this means Christ. The first of the two titles is of course suggested by the simile of the sheep. The image is so natural and so frequent, that we can not say for certain that it proves St. Peter's acquaintance with the parable of the Good Shepherd in John 10. More probably, perhaps, he is thinking of <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm" title="He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.">Psalm 23:3</a>, "He converted <span class= "ital">my soul</span>" (LXX.), where "the Lord," as usual, may be taken to mean the Son of God rather than the Father; or else of <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.">Ezekiel 34:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-16.htm" title="I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.">Ezekiel 34:16</a>, where the words rendered "seek them out" in our version is represented in the LXX. by that from which the name of a "bishop" is derived. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; also <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>, which last citation comes from a passage which has been in St. Peter's mind just before, <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>.) It is hardly necessary to add that to the Hebrew mind the thought of superintendence and ruling, not that of giving food, was uppermost when they spoke of shepherds, and that the pastors spoken of in the Old Testament are not the priests or givers of spiritual nutriment, but the kings and princes. Thus it will here be nearly synonymous with the second title of bishop. This name suggests in the first instance not so much overseeing as <span class= "ital">visiting</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>going carefully into the different cases brought under the officer's notice. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm" title="Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;">1Peter 5:2</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm" title="And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.">1Peter 5:4</a>, and <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>.) Both words were already familiar as ecclesiastical words already, and as such were especially appropriate to Christ, the Head of the Church; but as they had not yet become stereotyped in that sense, the writer adds, "of your souls," to show that it was not an outward sovereignty and protectorate which the Messiah had assumed over them. "Soul" is a word of which St. Peter is fond (<a href="/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1Peter 1:9</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-22.htm" title="Seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brothers, see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently:">1Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-19.htm" title="Why let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as to a faithful Creator.">1Peter 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-8.htm" title="(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)">2Peter 2:8</a>), but which is, perhaps, never used by St. Paul in this sense. It is to be remarked how St. Peter works almost every section of the Epistle round, so as to end with some encouragement to the readers to cling to Jesus as the Messiah, and to their Christian state, from which they were in danger of receding into Judaism. He makes even the special exhortations lead up to that which is the main exhortation of the Letter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye were as sheep going astray</span>; rather, with the best manuscripts, <span class="accented">for ye were going astray like sheep</span>. The apostle is probably still thinking of the great prophecy of Isaiah, and here almost reproduces the words of the sixth verse, "All we like sheep have gone astray." He who had been thrice charged to feed the sheep and the lambs of Christ would think also of the parable of the lost sheep, and of the people of Israel who were "as sheep having no shepherd" (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but ye returned</span> (the verb is aorist); that is, at the time of their conversion. The aorist passive, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, is so frequently used in a middle sense that the translation, "ye were converted," cannot be insisted on (comp. <a href="/mark/5-30.htm">Mark 5:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-13.htm">Matthew 10:13</a>). Christ is the Shepherd of our souls. The quotation from Isaiah doubtless brought before St. Peter's thoughts the sweet and holy allegory of the good Shepherd, which he had heard from the Savior's lips (comp. also <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; also <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.). The word "bishop" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used in a similar connection in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "Take heed... to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" comp. also <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, "I will both search my sheep, and seek them out," where the Greek word for "seek them out" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Lord Jesus Christ is the chief Shepherd (<a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>). He is also the chief Bishop or Overseer of those souls which he has bought to be his own with his most precious blood. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
