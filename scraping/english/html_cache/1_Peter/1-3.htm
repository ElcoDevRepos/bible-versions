The title "God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" emphasizes the unique relationship between God the Father and Jesus, affirming the deity and sonship of Christ. This echoes the Jewish Shema's monotheism while introducing the Christian understanding of the Trinity. The phrase also reflects the intimate relationship Jesus had with God, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>, where Jesus refers to God as "My Father and your Father."<p><b>By His great mercy</b><br>Mercy is a central theme in both the Old and New Testaments, often associated with God's covenantal love and compassion. In the Old Testament, God's mercy is frequently highlighted in His dealings with Israel, such as in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>. In the New Testament, mercy is exemplified in the life and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. This phrase underscores that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a gift from God, rooted in His merciful nature.<p><b>He has given us new birth</b><br>The concept of new birth, or being "born again," is foundational to Christian theology. It signifies a spiritual rebirth and transformation, as Jesus explained to Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>. This new birth is a work of the Holy Spirit, marking the beginning of a believer's new life in Christ. It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, where God promises to give His people a new heart and spirit.<p><b>into a living hope</b><br>The term "living hope" contrasts with dead or false hopes, emphasizing the dynamic and enduring nature of the hope believers have in Christ. This hope is not merely wishful thinking but is grounded in the reality of Jesus' resurrection. It is a hope that sustains believers through trials and is a recurring theme in Peter's epistle, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a> and <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>.<p><b>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith, as it validates Jesus' claims and His victory over sin and death. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's suffering and subsequent exaltation. The resurrection assures believers of their future resurrection and eternal life, as Paul elaborates in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>. It is the basis for the living hope mentioned earlier, providing assurance and motivation for holy living.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The source of mercy and the one who initiates the new birth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son of God, whose resurrection is central to the living hope believers have.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, writing to encourage believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/recipients_of_the_letter.htm">Recipients of the Letter</a></b><br>Early Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor, facing trials and persecution.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/resurrection_of_jesus_christ.htm">Resurrection of Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The pivotal event that provides believers with a living hope and assurance of eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_source_of_our_hope.htm">The Source of Our Hope</a></b><br>Our hope is not based on circumstances but on the unchanging nature of God and the historical fact of Christ's resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_mercy.htm">The Role of Mercy</a></b><br>God's mercy is the foundation of our salvation.

St. Peter adopts the doxology used by St. Paul in writing to the Churches at Corinth and Ephesus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>), the last being one of those to which this Epistle is addressed. It is a question whether the genitive, "of our Lord Jesus Christ," depends on both substantives or only on the last. The Greek will admit either view, and there are high authorities on both sides. On the whole, the first seems the most natural interpretation. The Lord himself had said, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). He could not say, "our God," for the relations are widely different; he could say, "my God," as he had said upon the cross; for, in the well-known words of Theophylact, "he is both the God and the Father of one and the same Christ; his God, as of Christ manifest in the flesh; his Father, as of God the Word." So St. Paul, after using this same form of salutation in <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, speaks of God in the seventeenth verse as "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" (comp. also <a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>). Which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; rather, <span class="accented">begat</span>, as in the Revised Version. St. Peter refers our regeneration back to the great fact of the resurrection of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is "the First-begotten of the dead" (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>); we are "buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead" (<a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). The Church, "which is his body" (<a href="/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>), died with him in his death, rose with him in his resurrection. Christians individually are baptized into his death, "that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life" (<a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). The resurrection of Christ was in a real sense the birth of the Church. Therefore St. Peter, who in <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> speaks so strongly of the effect of holy baptism, here refers oar regeneration to that without which baptism would be an empty ceremony, the resurrection of our Lord. God's great mercy (comp. <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 5</a>, "God, who is rich in mercy.... hath <span class="accented">quickened</span> us together with Christ") is the first cause of our new birth, Christ's resurrection is the means through which it was accomplished. St. Peter alone of the New Testament writers uses the word here rendered "hath begotten again" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); it occurs also in ver. 23. But our Lord himself, and his apostles St. James and St. Paul, teach the same truth to similar words (see <a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). Some commentators, as Luther, Bengel, etc., connect the words, "by the resurrection," etc., not with "hath begotten us again," but with the word "<span class="accented">lively"</span> or "living" - a hope that liveth through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This connection is grammatically possible, and gives a good and true meaning; it is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ which makes the Christian's hope living and strong; but the other explanation seems more natural, and is supported by such passages as <a href="/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>, and <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> of this Epistle. The heavenly inheritance is the ultimate end of our regeneration; the hope of that inheritance is the present joy of the Christian life. St. Paul reminds the Ephesian Christians that when they were without Christ they had no hope (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>); but God according to his great mercy begat us again into a new life, and one important aspect of that new life is hope, the hope of ever-deepening fellowship with God now, of everlasting life with God in heaven. That hope is living; it is "pervaded with life, carrying with it in undying power the certainty of fulfillment (<a href="/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>), and making the heart joyful and happy." (Huther); "it has life in itself, and gives life, and has life as its object" (De Wette). And it liveth, it doth not perish like the hopes of this world, but it lives on in ever fuller joy till it reaches its consummation in heaven; even there "hope <span class="accented">abideth</span>," <span class="accented">forever</span> in heaven there will be, it seems, a continual progress from glory to glory, nearer and nearer to the throne. St. Peter is the apostle of hope. "<span class="accented">He</span> loves," <span class="accented">says</span> Bengel, "the epithet living, and the mention of hope." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Blessed [be]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Eulog&#275;tos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2128.htm">Strong's 2128: </a> </span><span class="str2">(used only of God), blessed (as entitled to receive blessing from man), worthy of praise.
