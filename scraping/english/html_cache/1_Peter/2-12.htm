In the early church, Christians were often a minority and faced suspicion and misunderstanding from the surrounding pagan culture. The term "Gentiles" refers to non-Jews, but in this context, it broadly represents those outside the Christian faith. The call to conduct oneself with honor is rooted in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized love, humility, and righteousness (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). This conduct serves as a testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel.<p><b>that, though they slander you as evildoers</b><br>Early Christians were frequently accused of various crimes and immoral behaviors, often due to misunderstandings of their practices, such as the Eucharist, which was misinterpreted as cannibalism. The Roman Empire viewed Christians with suspicion, partly because they refused to worship the Roman gods and the emperor. This slander is reminiscent of the false accusations faced by Jesus (<a href="/mark/14-55.htm">Mark 14:55-59</a>) and highlights the call to endure persecution with patience and integrity, trusting in God's ultimate justice.<p><b>they may see your good deeds</b><br>The emphasis on "good deeds" aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who instructed His followers to let their light shine before others (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). These deeds are not just acts of charity but encompass a lifestyle of love, service, and moral integrity. The visibility of these deeds serves as a powerful witness to the truth of the Christian faith, countering false accusations and demonstrating the reality of God's work in believers' lives.<p><b>and glorify God on the day He visits us</b><br>This phrase points to the eschatological hope of Christ's return, a central tenet of Christian belief. The "day He visits us" refers to the day of the Lord, a time of divine intervention and judgment (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>). The ultimate goal of Christian conduct is to lead others to glorify God, either through their conversion or acknowledgment of God's righteousness at the final judgment. This reflects the prophetic vision of all nations recognizing God's sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/66-18.htm">Isaiah 66:18</a>) and underscores the missional aspect of Christian living.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers in their conduct.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentiles.htm">Gentiles</a></b><br>Non-Jewish people, often representing those outside the Christian faith in the context of the New Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/early_christian_communities.htm">Early Christian Communities</a></b><br>The recipients of Peter's letter, likely scattered throughout Asia Minor, facing persecution and misunderstanding from surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/living_honorably.htm">Living Honorably</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to live in a way that reflects Christ's character, even when faced with false accusations or slander.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_through_actions.htm">Witness Through Actions</a></b><br>Our good deeds serve as a testimony to non-believers, potentially leading them to glorify God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_persecution.htm">Endurance in Persecution</a></b><br>Despite being misunderstood or maligned, maintaining integrity and honor can have eternal significance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/impact_of_christian_conduct.htm">Impact of Christian Conduct</a></b><br>Our behavior can influence others' perceptions of God and the gospel, highlighting the importance of our daily actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eschatological_perspective.htm">Eschatological Perspective</a></b><br>The reference to "the day He visits us" reminds believers of the ultimate accountability and hope in Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Peter_2_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Peter 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_uphold_honor_with_non-believers.htm">How can we maintain "honorable conduct" among non-believers in today's society?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_2_12_Influence_others_by_actions.htm">What does 1 Peter 2:12 teach about influencing others through our actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_5_16_to_1_Peter_2_12.htm">How does Matthew 5:16 relate to 1 Peter 2:12's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_good_deeds_glorify_God_on_visitation.htm">In what ways can our good deeds glorify God on "the day of visitation"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_1_Peter_2_12_at_work_community.htm">How can you apply 1 Peter 2:12 in your workplace or community?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_2_12_Living_among_non-believers.htm">How does 1 Peter 2:12 encourage Christians to live among non-believers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_1_Peter_2_12.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of 1 Peter 2:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_2_12_s_link_to_Christian_witness.htm">How does 1 Peter 2:12 relate to the concept of Christian witness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_peter_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Peter 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_day_of_visitation.htm">What is the Day of Visitation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_christian_conduct_in_the_bible.htm">What does the Bible say about Christian conduct?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_to_let_our_light_shine.htm">How can we let our light shine before others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_to_preach_the_gospel_wordlessly.htm">How can you preach the gospel without using words?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Peter 2:12 Mean</div><b>Conduct yourselves with such honor</b><p>&#8220;Conduct yourselves with such honor&#8230;&#8221;

It means that the very fact of the heathen having slandered them will make their testimony "in the day of visitation" all the more striking, as (by way of illustration) the doubts of St. Thomas tend to "the more confirmation of the faith." So in <a href="/romans/2-1.htm" title="Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.">Romans 2:1</a>, "wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself;" or <a href="/hebrews/2-18.htm" title="For in that he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to succor them that are tempted.">Hebrews 2:18</a> (lit.), "<span class= "ital">wherein</span> He Himself hath suffered, being tempted." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles.</span> If we read <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 11 (some ancient manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), there is a slight irregularity in the construction, as the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is nominative; it gives more force and vividness to the sentence (comp. in the Greek, <a href="/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>). The conversation (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, mode of life or behavior) of the unconverted is described as "<span class="accented">vain"</span> in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; the conversation of Christians must be seemly (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>), exhibiting the beauty of holiness. The Churches to which St. Peter wrote were in Gentile countries; they must be careful, for the honor of their religion, to set a good example among the heathen - a warning, alas! too often neglected in modern as well as in ancient times. <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wherein</span>, in the matter in which they speak, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in reference to manner of life. Christians were commonly accused of "turning the world upside down;" of doing "contrary to the decrees of Caesar," as at Thessalonica (<a href="/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 7</a>); of being atheists and blasphemers of the popular idolatry, as at Ephesus (<a href="/acts/19-37.htm">Acts 19:37</a>). Suetonius calls them a "genus hominum superstitionis novae et maleficse" ('Vit. Neron.,' 1 Peter 16.). Probably the grosser accusations of Thyestean banquets, etc., came later. <span class="cmt_word">They may by your good works, which they shall be hold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> The word rendered, "which they shall be bold" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or, according to some of the older manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, beholding), occurs only here and in <a href="/1_peter/3-2.htm">1 Peter 3:2</a>. It implies close attention; the Gentiles watched the conduct of the Christians, narrowly scrutinizing it to discover faults and inconsistencies. The use of the corresponding substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a> is a coincidence to be noticed. It is not probable that there is any reference to the heathen use of the word in connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries. St. Peter hopes that this close observation of the lives of Christian people would lead the Gentiles to glorify God; he was thinking, perhaps, of our Lord's words in the sermon on the mount: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' Perhaps in the following clause also we may trace an echo of the Savior's words in <a href="/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>, "<span class="accented">Because</span> thou knewest not the time of thy visitation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, as here). St. Peter hopes that the holy lives of Christians may be made the means of saving many Gentile souls in the time of visitation; that is, when God should visit the heathen with his converting grace, seeking to draw them to himself, whether by gracious chastisement or by the preaching of his servants. This seems more natural than to understand the words of God's visitation of the Christians in the persecutions which were impending; though it is true that many Gentiles were won to Christ by the calm and holy bearing of suffering Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Conduct</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(echontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
