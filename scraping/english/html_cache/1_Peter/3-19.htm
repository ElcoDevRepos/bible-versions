The context of <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18-22</a> highlights Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection, underscoring His victory over sin and death. The phrase "in whom" connects to the preceding verse, which speaks of Christ being made alive in the spirit, indicating His spiritual authority and power.<p><b>He also went</b><br>This suggests a deliberate action taken by Christ. The concept of "going" implies movement from one place to another, which in this context is understood as a spiritual journey. This action is often interpreted as occurring between Christ's death and resurrection, a time when He was active in the spiritual realm.<p><b>and preached</b><br>The term "preached" here is often understood as proclaiming or announcing. It is not necessarily evangelistic in the sense of offering salvation, but rather a declaration of victory and authority. This proclamation is seen as a fulfillment of Christ's triumph over evil, aligning with <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, which speaks of Christ disarming the powers and authorities.<p><b>to the spirits</b><br>The "spirits" are generally interpreted as beings in the spiritual realm. There is debate over whether these spirits are human souls or fallen angels. The context and language suggest these are not the souls of the righteous, but rather those who are in a state of confinement, possibly referring to the "sons of God" mentioned in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6:1-4</a>.<p><b>in prison</b><br>The "prison" is understood as a place of confinement in the spiritual realm. This is not a physical location but a state of being for these spirits. The concept of a spiritual prison aligns with Jewish traditions and other biblical references, such as <a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>, which speaks of angels kept in eternal chains. This phrase emphasizes the authority of Christ over all spiritual realms, including those in rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who, after His crucifixion, is described as having gone to preach to the "spirits in prison."<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirits_in_prison.htm">Spirits in Prison</a></b><br>This phrase is often interpreted to refer to the disobedient spirits or souls who were in a state of confinement or waiting, possibly those who lived during the time of Noah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah's_time.htm">Noah's Time</a></b><br>The context of the passage suggests a connection to the time of Noah, a period characterized by widespread disobedience and the subsequent judgment of the flood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3</a> speaks to the resurrection of Jesus, which is pivotal to understanding His authority and power over all spiritual realms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flood.htm">The Flood</a></b><br>An event that serves as a backdrop for understanding the disobedience of the spirits and the subsequent judgment, highlighting God's righteousness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_victory_over_sin_and_death.htm">Christ's Victory Over Sin and Death</a></b><br>Jesus' proclamation to the spirits signifies His victory over sin and death, affirming His authority over all creation, both seen and unseen.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_spiritual_realms.htm">The Reality of Spiritual Realms</a></b><br>This passage reminds believers of the existence of spiritual realms and the ongoing spiritual battle, encouraging vigilance and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>The reference to Noah's time underscores God's righteous judgment against sin, serving as a warning and a call to repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_christ's_resurrection.htm">Hope in Christ's Resurrection</a></b><br>Believers can find hope in the resurrection of Christ, which assures us of our future resurrection and eternal life with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/proclamation_of_the_gospel.htm">Proclamation of the Gospel</a></b><br>Just as Christ proclaimed victory, believers are called to proclaim the gospel, sharing the hope and truth of salvation with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Peter_3_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Peter 3:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_3_19_s_call_to_bold_Gospel_sharing.htm">How does 1 Peter 3:19 encourage us to share the Gospel boldly?

Far from offering them salvation, He declared that their rebellion was eternally judged and that He is Lord over life, death, and every realm. The verse therefore magnifies Jesus&#8217; absolute triumph and assures believers that no hostile power&#8212;seen or unseen&#8212;can overturn His finished work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">By which.</span>--If "by the Spirit" had been right in the former verse, this translation might have stood here, though the word is literally <span class= "ital">in;</span> for "in" is often used to mean "in the power of," "on the strength of:" <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>. But as that former rendering is untenable, we must here keep strictly to <span class= "ital">in which</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in spirit. This might mean either of two things: (1) "spiritually speaking," "so far as thought and sympathy goes," as, for instance, <a href="/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1Corinthians 5:3</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-5.htm" title=" For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.">Colossians 2:5</a>; or else (2) "in spirit," as opposed to "in the body"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"out of the body" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2Corinthians 12:2</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>), as a disembodied spirit. We adopt the latter rendering without hesitation, for reasons which will be clearer in the next Note.<p><span class= "bld">He went and preached unto the spirits in prison.</span>--There are two main ways of interpreting this mysterious passage. (1) The spirits are understood as being <span class= "ital">now</span> in prison, in consequence of having rejected His preaching to them while they were still on earth. According to this interpretation--which has the support of such names as Pearson, Hammond, Barrow, and Leighton (though he afterwards modified his opinion). among ourselves, besides divers great theologians of other countries, including St. Thomas Aquinas on the one hand and Beza on the other--it was "in spirit," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>mystically speaking, our Lord Himself who, in and through the person of Noah, preached repentance to the old world. Thus the passage is altogether dissociated from the doctrine of the descent into hell; and the sense (though not the Greek) would be better expressed by writing, <span class= "ital">He had gone and preached unto the spirits</span> (<span class= "ital">now</span>)<span class= "ital"> in prison.</span> In this case, however, it is difficult to see the purpose of the digression, or what could have brought the subject into St. Peter's mind. (2) The second interpretation--which is that of (practically) all the Fathers, and of Calvin, Luther (finally), Bellarmine, Bengel, and of most modern scholars--refers the passage to what our Lord did while His body was dead. This is the most natural construction to put upon the words "in which also" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in spirit). It thus gives point to the saying that He was "quickened in spirit," which would otherwise be left very meaningless. The "spirits" here will thus correspond with "in spirit" there. It is the only way to assign any intelligible meaning to the words "He went and" to suppose that He "went" straight from His quickening in spirit--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from His death. It is far the most natural thing to suppose that the spirits <span class= "ital">were</span> in prison at the time when Christ went and preached to them. We take it, then, to mean that, directly Christ's human spirit was disengaged from the body, He gave proof of the new powers of purely spiritual action thus acquired by going off to the place, or state, in which other disembodied spirits were (who would have been incapable of receiving direct impressions from Him had He not Himself been in the purely spiritual condition), and conveyed to them certain tidings: He "preached" unto them. What was the substance of this preaching we are not here told, the word itself (which is not the same as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>) only means to publish or proclaim like a crier or herald; and as the spirits are said to have been disobedient and in prison, some have thought that Christ went to proclaim to them the certainty of their damnation! The notion has but to be mentioned to be rejected with horror; but it may be pointed out also that in <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>, which refers back to this passage, it is distinctly called a "gospel;" and it would be too grim to call that a gospel which (in Calvin's words) "made it more clear and patent to them that they were shut out from all salvation!" He brought <span class= "ital">good</span> tidings, therefore, of some kind to the "prison" and the spirits in it. And this "prison" must not be understood (with Bp. Browne, <span class= "ital">Articles, </span>p. 95) as merely "a place of safe keeping," where good spirits might be as well as bad, though etymologically this is imaginable. The word occurs thirty-eight times in the New Testament in the undoubted sense of a "prison," and not once in that of a place of protection, though twice (<a href="/revelation/18-2.htm" title="And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.">Revelation 18:2</a>) it is used in the derived sense of "a cage." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>). The Lord was no longer in the flesh; the component parts of his human nature were separated by death; his flesh lay in the grave. As he had gone about doing good in the flesh, so now he went in the spirit - in his holy human spirit. <span class="accented">He went.</span> The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs again in ver. 22, "who is <span class="accented">gone</span> into heaven." It must have the same meaning in both places; in ver. 22 it asserts a change of locality; it must do the like here. There it is used of the ascent into heaven; it can scarcely mean here that, without any such change of place, Christ preached, not in his own Person, but through Noah or the apostles. Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> (the Epistle which seems to have been so much in St. Peter's thoughts), "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" <span class="accented">And preached</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). It is the word constantly used of the Lord from the time when "Jesus began to preach (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). Then, himself in our human flesh, he preached to men living in the flesh - to a few of his own age and country. Now the range of his preaching was extended; himself in the spirit, he preached to spirits: "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>; spiritu, spiritibus." says Bengel; "<span class="accented">congruens sermo."</span> He preached <span class="accented">also</span> to the spirits; not only once to living men, but now also to spirits, even to them. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> calls for attention; it implies a new and additional fact; it emphasizes the substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The preaching and the condition of the hearers are mentioned together; they were spirits when they heard the preaching. It seems impossible to understand these words of preaching through Noah or the apostles to men who passed afterwards into the state of disembodied spirits. And he preached in the spirit. The words seem to limit the preaching to the time when the Lord's soul was left in Hades (<a href="/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>). Huther, indeed, says that "<span class="accented">as</span> both expressions (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) apply to Christ in his entire Person, consisting of body and soul, what follows must not be conceived as an activity which he exercised in his spirit only, and whilst separated from his body." But does <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> apply to body and <span class="accented">soul?</span> Men "are not able to kill the soul." And is it true, as Huther continues, that the first words of this verse are not opposed to the view that Christ preached in his glorified body, "inasmuch as in <span class="accented">this</span> body the Lord is no longer <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>, but entirely <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>? Indeed, we are taught that "<span class="accented">flesh</span> and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; "and that that which "<span class="accented">is</span> sown a natural body is raised a spiritual body" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); but Christ himself said of his resurrection-body, "A spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have" (<a href="/luke/24-39.htm">Luke 24:39</a>). He preached to "the spirits <span class="accented">in prison</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>)." (For <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, comp. <a href="/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>, etc.). It cannot mean the whole realm of the dead, but only that part of Hades in which the souls of the ungodly are reserved unto the day of judgment.
