The "eyes of the Lord" is a metaphor used throughout Scripture to denote God's watchful presence (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). The righteous are those who have been justified by faith and live in obedience to God's commandments. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where He promises protection and guidance (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>). The imagery of God's eyes suggests a personal and intimate awareness of the lives of the faithful.<p><b>and His ears are inclined to their prayer</b><br>This part of the verse highlights God's responsiveness to the prayers of the righteous. The concept of God hearing prayers is a recurring theme in the Bible, indicating His willingness to engage with His people (<a href="/psalms/66-19.htm">Psalm 66:19-20</a>). The phrase "inclined to their prayer" suggests an active listening, implying that God not only hears but is also ready to respond. This assurance is rooted in the covenant promises where God commits to being attentive to the cries of His people (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). It underscores the importance of prayer as a means of communication with God and a demonstration of faith.<p><b>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.</b><br>This phrase serves as a warning and a contrast to the previous assurances given to the righteous. The "face of the Lord" symbolizes His presence and favor, and when it is "against" someone, it indicates disapproval and judgment (<a href="/leviticus/20-3.htm">Leviticus 20:3</a>). Those who do evil are those who reject God's commandments and live in sin. This reflects the biblical principle of divine justice, where God opposes the proud and punishes wickedness (<a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>). The imagery of God's face being against evildoers serves as a deterrent, reminding believers of the consequences of sin and the importance of living a life pleasing to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

The sense that the Lord's eyes are over you is a sufficient reason for self-restraint under provocation: especially, perhaps, when we see that by "the Lord" St. Peter understands Jesus Christ. That this is the case is clear from his use of the same Psalm in <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>. If Christ, the model of meekness under persecution (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>), is watching, we not only <span class= "ital">need</span> no passionate self-defence, but should be ashamed to use it. Was St. Peter thinking how once, while he himself was cursing and swearing at those who accused him of being a Christian, he felt the eyes of the Lord turn upon him? The thought of His eyes being over Us is chiefly that of guardianship.<p><span class= "bld">Open unto their prayers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">are towards their prayer</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>directed towards it. Here, as in <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>, the Prayer Book version has influenced our translation.<p><span class= "bld">Against them that do evil.</span>--There is no difference in the Greek between this preposition and that just rendered "over." <span class= "ital">But the countenance of the Lord is over them that do evil things.</span> He <span class= "ital">marks</span> what they are doing. This is sufficient comfort when men injure us (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a>); sufficient warning not to injure in return. It is instructive now to turn and see the circumstances in which this lovely Psalm was composed. The moment was one of David's extremest peril among an infuriated heathen population. The danger and dread he was in are shown in Psalms 56. Yet nothing can be brighter and more serene than Psalms 34. He had obtained life and days; and it was all through confidence in God on the one hand, and inoffensive self-submission on the other. Had he used violence--"shown spirit," as we say--like the "young lions," he would have come worse off. It seems to be for this cause that St. Peter deemed the Psalm so appropriate to his readers, misjudged and suspiciously watched (<a href="/context/psalms/56-5.htm" title="Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.">Psalm 56:5-6</a>) by unbelievers, who only waited the opportunity to shed their blood (<a href="/context/psalms/56-1.htm" title="Be merciful to me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresses me.">Psalm 56:1-2</a>). But the striking change is that, whereas David's trust in Jehovah was a trust simply in the Eternal Being without distinction of Persons, St. Peter bids the Hebrews of Asia read that Psalm into an act of faith in Jesus. We shall see the same thing in <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>, as we saw it in <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>. The force of the change will be felt by any one who reads through that Psalm, substituting (like the Rheims version) "our Lord" for "the Lord." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers.</span> The apostle adds the conjunction "for" (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, because) to mark the connection. God's people must turn away from evil and do good, because the all-seeing eye is upon them; they will find strength to do so, because God heareth prayer. Perhaps when the apostle was writing these words he remembered how once "the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter." <span class="cmt_word">But the face of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> is against them that do evil.</span> The preposition in the two clauses is the same (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, over, or upon). The Lord's eye is upon the good and the evil. The apostle omits the words that follow in the psalm, "to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth," perhaps because he wishes us to regard the spiritual rather than the temporal consequences of our actions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the] eyes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8000;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#955;&#956;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(ophthalmoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3788.htm">Strong's 3788: </a> </span><span class="str2">The eye; fig: the mind's eye.
