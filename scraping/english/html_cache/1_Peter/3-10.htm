The desire to "love life and see good days" reflects a longing for a life that is fulfilling and blessed. In the biblical context, "good days" are often associated with living in accordance with God's will, which brings peace and prosperity. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the abundant life (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). The concept of loving life is not merely about physical longevity but about experiencing the fullness of life that God intends for His people.<p><b>must keep his tongue from evil</b><br>The control of one's speech is a recurring theme in Scripture, underscoring the power of words to build up or destroy (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-10</a> elaborates on the destructive potential of the tongue, likening it to a small fire that can set a forest ablaze. In the cultural context of the early church, where persecution and slander were common, maintaining pure speech was crucial for preserving community integrity and witness. This directive calls believers to refrain from harmful speech, which includes gossip, slander, and any form of verbal abuse.<p><b>and his lips from deceitful speech.</b><br>Deceitful speech encompasses lying, manipulation, and any form of dishonesty. The biblical narrative consistently condemns deceit, as seen in the story of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>), where deceit led to severe consequences. Truthfulness is a reflection of God's character, who is described as a God of truth (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus identifies Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), setting the standard for His followers. The call to avoid deceitful speech is a call to emulate Christ, who was without deceit (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), and to live in a manner that reflects the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

St. Peter's quotation, from <a href="/context/psalms/34-12.htm" title="What man is he that desires life, and loves many days, that he may see good?">Psalm 34:12-16</a>, is not exact, according to either Septuagint or Hebrew, but the divergence is probably not due to a confusion of memory, but (as often) designed to bring out an additional significance. The Psalmist had asked merely, "What man is he that lusteth to <span class= "ital">live</span>?" and he promises merely long life to self-restraint. The Apostle asks, Who cares to have a life <span class= "ital">worth having, </span>a life which makes a man <span class= "ital">glad to live?</span> This is the "blessing" spoken of in <a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm" title="Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.">1Peter 3:9</a>--not simply everlasting life, but a life of unruffled happiness.

Perhaps the meaning is best given by Bengel, "Qui vult ita vivere, nt ipsum non taedeat vitro" - " Who wishes to live so that he will not weary of life;" so that he may love it, so that he may have a life really worth living. There is a love of life which can only lead to the loss of the true life (<a href="/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>).
