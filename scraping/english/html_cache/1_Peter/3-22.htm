After His resurrection, Jesus spent 40 days with His disciples before ascending to heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). The ascension signifies the completion of His earthly ministry and His return to the Father. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a> and is a precursor to His promised return. The ascension also marks the beginning of His heavenly intercession for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>and is at the right hand of God</b><br>The right hand of God is a position of honor, authority, and power. In ancient cultures, sitting at the right hand of a king signified a place of favor and influence. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to denote Jesus' exalted status (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). It underscores His divine authority and His role as the mediator between God and humanity. This position also indicates the completion of His redemptive work, as He now reigns with God the Father.<p><b>with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the supremacy of Christ over all spiritual beings and earthly powers.

The subjection of these entities to Christ highlights His victory over sin and death, achieved through His death and resurrection (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). It assures believers of Christ's ultimate control over all creation and His ability to protect and sustain His church. This authority is a fulfillment of the promise that all things would be placed under His feet (<a href="/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, who has ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The spiritual realm where God resides and where Jesus has ascended.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity, whose right hand is a position of honor and authority.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Spiritual beings created by God, who are subject to Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/authorities_and_powers.htm">Authorities and Powers</a></b><br>These refer to both spiritual and earthly realms of power that are under Christ's dominion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_authority_and_sovereignty.htm">Christ's Authority and Sovereignty</a></b><br>Jesus' position at the right hand of God signifies His ultimate authority over all creation, both spiritual and earthly.

His finished work, present intercession, and absolute sovereignty give believers unshakable confidence and hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God.</span>--This verse (which partakes of the character of a doxology) serves two purposes. First, it carries on the history of Jesus Christ. How carefully, in spite of what seem at first irrelevant digressions, St. Peter holds his threads. Christ's passion and death, activity among the dead, resurrection from among them, ascension into heaven, perpetual session in glory, follow one another in due order. The second purpose of the clause runs parallel to the first. St. Peter is teaching the entire conformity of the believer to the Lord. If the believer will but retain his good conscience, he may hope for a precisely similar experience. The Latin and several other good versions, together with several Latin Fathers, add a curious sentence after the words "on the right hand of God," which runs: <span class= "ital">swallowing up death, that we might be made heirs of eternal life;</span> but there is no sufficient authority for the sentence. The first notion of being "on the right hand of God," taken, probably, from <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, seems to be that of occupying the highest post of honour possible, next after that of God--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Father--Himself It is not necessary here to consider what else may be implied in the phrase as to the conditions of our Lord's human existence; but when we compare St. Paul's statement, in <a href="/ephesians/4-10.htm" title="He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)">Ephesians 4:10</a>, about His now "filling all things," we feel that these pictorial words, such as "heaven" and "right hand of God," are intended to convey the notion that His humanity is now entirely <span class= "ital">without</span> conditions, though still retaining all that is truly essential to humanity. It may be observed that, assuming (as even most sceptical critics do) the genuineness of this Epistle, we have here at first hand the deliberate evidence of one who had been perfectly familiar with Jesus Christ as man with man. By what stretch of imagination can we suppose that such a person could ever have invented, or have accepted from others this mode of speaking about his former Teacher, had he not been conscious of the resurrection and ascension of Jesus as simply historical facts, of the same order as the fact of His death?<p><span class= "bld">Angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him</span>.--There can be no doubt that this whole verse is coloured by recollection of the circular letter which St. Paul had sent to the Churches of Asia, which we call the Epistle to the Ephesians. Perhaps the heresy which St. Paul lamented in that Epistle may still have lingered in existence, in cabalistic Jewish circles, among those same Churches when St. Peter thus wrote to them. He may, for the moment, be glancing away from his faint-hearted Hebrew brethren, who, in fear of persecution, were slinking back into Judaism, and turning rather to those Gnosticising Jews who began to abound in Asia, who made "genealogies" of aeons, and gave Christ a place among them. In favour of such an opinion one might appeal to the vivid picture of licentiousness in the next chapter, and the development of the same, manifestly under Gnostic influence, in the Second Epistle and in the Apocalypse. From the expression "being made subject," or, literally, <span class= "ital">having been subdued</span> (or, <span class= "ital">subjected</span>) "we may infer that St. Peter meant <span class= "ital">evil</span> spirits, this being a crowning <span class= "ital">triumph</span> of Christ, and not only a mark of His <span class= "ital">exaltation.</span> We need not think that St. Peter, any more than St. Paul, is distinctly teaching that there <span class= "ital">are</span> such grades of spiritual beings; he is probably only borrowing the titles from the heretics glanced at, and saying that, whatever unseen powers there are, whatever they may be called, they are now cubdued to Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is gone into heaven</span>. The word here rendered "gone" is that used in ver. 19, "he went and preached (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>)" (comp. <a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>, "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"). <span class="cmt_word">And is on</span> <span class="cmt_word">the right hand of God</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). It is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, for he who is the signal Example, who suffered, the Just for the unjust, is now exalted to the right hand of the Majesty on high; and "is able to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." <span class="cmt_word">Angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him</span>. God "hath set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come." All the angels of God, in the various grades of the heavenly hierarchy, are made subject to Christ. The words seem to include, especially when read in comparison with <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, the evil angels also; they are made subject against their will to Christ; they asked him once if he was come to torment them before the time.
