They held significant authority and were often seen as the face of Roman rule in local regions. In the context of 1 Peter, Christians were encouraged to respect these authorities, recognizing their role in maintaining societal order. This aligns with Paul's teaching in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>, where believers are urged to submit to governing authorities as they are instituted by God.<p><b>as those sent by him</b><br>The phrase "sent by him" refers to the belief that governing authorities are established by God for the purpose of maintaining order and justice. This reflects the biblical principle that God is sovereign over all earthly powers, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God is described as the one who "removes kings and sets up kings." The idea is that even secular authorities serve a divine purpose in God's overarching plan.<p><b>to punish those who do wrong</b><br>The role of governors to "punish those who do wrong" underscores the function of government as an enforcer of justice. This is consistent with the biblical view that justice is a key component of God's character, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. The punishment of wrongdoers serves as a deterrent to evil and a means of protecting society, reflecting the moral order that God desires.<p><b>and to praise those who do right</b><br>Praising those who do right highlights the positive role of government in encouraging virtuous behavior. This can be seen as a form of public recognition or reward for good citizenship, which aligns with the biblical principle of honoring what is good and just. <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a> states, "Righteousness exalts a nation," suggesting that the promotion of righteousness leads to societal flourishing. This also reflects the idea that believers are called to live exemplary lives that can be commended by others, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, where Jesus encourages His followers to let their light shine before others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Of course the person "by" whom they are here said to be (from time to time) "sent" is Caesar, not "the Lord." The persons to whom the letter is addressed would have very little to do with Caesar himself directly, their submission would be chiefly shown to the lieutenants. Yet how personal was the Imperial government, even in details, is shown in Pliny's letters; the very letter before that in which he asks how to deal with the Christians of Bithynia requests Trajan's leave to cover in an unhealthy beck in the town of Amastris.<p><span class= "bld">For the punishment of evildoers.</span>--St. Peter credits Roman imperialism (rightly in the main) with having as its aim the promotion of moral behaviour among its subjects. The word for "punishment" is that which is translated "vengeance" in <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm" title="In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:">2Thessalonians 1:8</a>, and implies forcing the malefactors to make satisfaction to those whom they had wronged, the "avenger" being, of course, quite disinterested. The "praise" which here, as in <a href="/romans/13-3.htm" title="For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:">Romans 13:3</a>, is said to have been bestowed by the government on welldoers, must mean the solid praise of preferments, which is hardly so marked a feature of government as the foregoing. Be it observed that neither St. Peter nor St. Paul lay down any exceptions to the rule of complete obedience. They refuse to contemplate, at least to formulate, the occasions when disobedience may be necessary. Obedience is the first thing to learn, and when they have learnt it, they will know of themselves when to disobey. St. Peter himself stands to all time as the type of magnificent disobedience (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm" title="But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, judge you.">Acts 4:19</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or unto governors, as ante them that are sent by him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">through him</span>. Some commentators, following Calvin, understand the pronoun of the Lord. Certainly, governors are sent through him; he "ordereth all things, both in heaven and earth." But it seems more natural in this place to refer the pronoun to the nearer substantive, the king; it was through the Roman emperor that the various governors, legates, etc., were sent from time to time (as the Greek present participle implies) to administer the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">For the punish-meat of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</span> Observe the close resemblance to <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3, 4</a>. St. Peter recognizes the Roman sense of justice which we see in men like Festus and Gallio. At first the Jews were the persecutors of the Christians; the Roman magistrates were their protectors. St. Peter wrote before the great outbreaks of Roman persecution; he was himself to suffer under that emperor whose authority he upheld. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">or</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7988;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(eite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1535.htm">Strong's 1535: </a> </span><span class="str2">And if, whether.
