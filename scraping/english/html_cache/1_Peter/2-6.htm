Peter is referencing the Old Testament, showing the continuity between the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. It underscores the belief that the Scriptures are divinely inspired and authoritative for teaching and doctrine.<p><b>See, I lay in Zion a stone:</b><br>Zion refers to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. The imagery of a stone laid in Zion is drawn from <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, where God promises a foundation stone for His people. This stone represents stability and strength, signifying God's plan and purpose being established in Jerusalem, the city of David.<p><b>a chosen and precious cornerstone;</b><br>The cornerstone is the foundational stone in ancient building practices, crucial for the alignment and stability of the entire structure. In biblical typology, this cornerstone is a metaphor for Jesus Christ, chosen by God and precious in His sight. This reflects the messianic prophecy and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ, as seen in <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a> and further affirmed in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>.<p><b>and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.</b><br>This promise assures believers of their security and honor in Christ. The phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, emphasizing faith in Jesus as the cornerstone. It assures that those who trust in Him will not experience ultimate disgrace or disappointment, contrasting with the fate of those who reject Him.

The right reading here is not "wherefore also," but <span class= "ital">because</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the quotations are introduced in the same way as in <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm" title="Because it is written, Be you holy; for I am holy.">1Peter 1:16</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-24.htm" title="For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass wither, and the flower thereof falls away:">1Peter 1:24</a>, as justifying the foregoing expressions.<p><span class= "bld">It is contained in the scripture.</span>--In the original the phrase is a curious one. "The scripture" never means the Old Testament as a whole, which would be called "the Scriptures," but is always the particular book or passage of the Old Testament. Literally, then, our present phrase runs, <span class= "ital">because it encloses</span> or <span class= "ital">contains in that passage.</span> Thus attention is drawn to the context of the quotation, and in this context we shall again find what made St. Peter quote the text.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, I lay.</span>--The sentence is taken from <a href="/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>, and, like the last, is adapted to the occasion out of both Hebrew and LXX. Gesenius on that passage gives evidence to show that the early Jewish explanation, current in our Lord's time, referred it to the Messiah; the later Rabbinical expositors, probably by way of opposition to the Christians, explained it to mean Hezekiah. In order to gain a clear conception of St. Peter's aim in the quotation, it is necessary to glance over the whole section contained in the 28th and 29th chapters of Isaiah. "The prophecy here cited," says Archbishop Leighton, "if we look upon it in its own place, we shall find inserted in the middle of a very sad denunciation of judgment against the Jews." Besides our present text, which is quoted also in <a href="/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>, our Lord's prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem is an amplification of <a href="/context/isaiah/29-3.htm" title="And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.">Isaiah 29:3-4</a>; His sharp censure of the corrupt traditions which had superseded the law of God (<a href="/context/matthew/15-7.htm" title="You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,">Matthew 15:7-9</a>) is taken from <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a>; St. Paul's image of the potter changing his purpose with the lump of clay (<a href="/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>), comes from <a href="/isaiah/29-16.htm" title="Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?">Isaiah 29:16</a>. Like one bright spot in the sad picture appears our verse, but only as serving to heighten the general gloom. St. Peter's quotation here, therefore, calling attention as it does to the context, is at least as much intended to show his Hebrew readers the sweeping away of the carnal Israel as to encourage them in their Christian allegiance. In the original passage the sure foundation is contrasted with the refuge of lies which the Jewish rulers had constructed for themselves against Assyria, "scorning" this sure foundation as a piece of antiquated and unpractical religionism. Nagelsbach (in his new commentary on Isaiah) seems to be right in interpreting the "refuge of lies" to mean the diplomatic skill with which Ahaz and the Jewish authorities flattered themselves their treaty with Egypt was drawn up, and the "sure foundation" opposed to it is primarily God's plighted promise to the house of David, in which all who trusted would have no cause for flight. In the Messianic fulfilment, those promises are all summed up in the one person of Jesus Christ (<a href="/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="For all the promises of God in him are yes, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.">2Corinthians 1:20</a>); and the "refuge of lies" in which the Jewish rulers had trusted was the wicked policy by which they had tried to secure their "place and nation" against the Romans (<a href="/john/11-48.htm" title="If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.">John 11:48</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture</span>; literally, <span class="accented">because it contains in Scripture</span>.

St. Paul quotes the same prophecy still more freely (<a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). The rabbinical writers understand it of Hezekiah, but the earlier Jewish interpreters regarded it as Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</span> The Hebrew words literally mean "shall not be in haste;" the Septuagint appears to give the general meaning. He that believeth (the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, means "to lean upon, to build upon," and so "to trust, to confide") shall not be flurried and excited with vain fears and trepidation; his mind is stayed on the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#972;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(dioti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1360.htm">Strong's 1360: </a> </span><span class="str2">On this account, because, for.
