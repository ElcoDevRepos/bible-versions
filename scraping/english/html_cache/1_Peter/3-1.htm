The "same way" indicates a continuation of the theme of submission, emphasizing a voluntary and respectful attitude. This reflects the broader biblical principle of order and harmony within relationships, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-21.htm">Ephesians 5:21-24</a>, where mutual submission is encouraged within the body of Christ.<p><b>submit yourselves to your husbands,</b><br>Submission here is understood as a willing and respectful deference to the husband's leadership within the marriage. This is not about inferiority but about fulfilling God-given roles. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on household order, and this instruction aligns with the Greco-Roman household codes, yet it is distinct in its call for mutual respect and love, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>, where husbands are called to love their wives sacrificially.<p><b>so that even if they refuse to believe the word,</b><br>This acknowledges the reality of mixed-faith marriages, which were common in the early church as Christianity spread. The phrase highlights the potential for a believing wife to influence her unbelieving husband through her conduct. This reflects the evangelistic nature of Christian living, where actions can speak louder than words, as also suggested in <a href="/1_corinthians/7-12.htm">1 Corinthians 7:12-16</a>, which discusses the sanctifying influence of a believing spouse.<p><b>they will be won over without words</b><br>The emphasis here is on the power of a godly example. The silent witness of a transformed life can be more persuasive than verbal arguments. This principle is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized living out one's faith as a testimony to others (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>). The idea is that the husband's heart may be softened and opened to the gospel through observing the genuine faith and love of his wife.<p><b>by the behavior of their wives</b><br>The behavior mentioned refers to a lifestyle characterized by purity, reverence, and love, as further elaborated in <a href="/1_peter/3-2.htm">1 Peter 3:2</a>. This aligns with the fruit of the Spirit described in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.

Here, again, the form in the original is participial, joining this injunction on to <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm" title="Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;">1Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18</a>, where the word is the same in Greek, "wives, in the same way submitting yourselves." Whether this imposes for all time upon Christian wives as complete a submission towards their husbands as is here enjoined might perhaps be questioned, because the special reason for the command in this place was to allay suspicions engendered by the boldness with which Christianity proclaimed the freedom of the individual. St. Peter has just been giving injunctions for absolute submission, even to injustice, on the part of slaves; and the progress of Christianity has abolished slavery altogether. The measure of the Christian wife's submission may safely be left to her own enlightened conscience, guided by other passages of the New Testament not written, like this, for a special emergency.<p><span class= "bld">Your own husbands.</span>--This does not order submission to the husband in contrast to submission to other directors, but rather gives a <span class= "ital">reason</span> for obedience.

The only places where it is distinctly used of others are <a href="/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> (of Jew and Gentile together), <a href="/romans/11-30.htm" title="For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:">Romans 11:30</a> (where the Gentiles are compared with the Jews), <a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm" title="And to whom swore he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?">Hebrews 3:18</a> (of the Israelites in the wilderness), <a href="/hebrews/11-31.htm" title="By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.">Hebrews 11:31</a> (of the men of Jericho), <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1Peter 3:20</a> (of the refractory antediluvians). In any case it must mean a wilful refusal to submit to the Word, in spite of being intellectually convinced. (See especially <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>.) For every reason, therefore, it is more probable that the case here supposed is that of Hebrew (Christian) women, married to men of their own race who reject the gospel. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye wives.</span> St. Peter has spoken of the duties of servants: why does he omit those of masters? There must have been Christian masters in Asia Minor, as is plain from <a href="/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>. But we notice that St. Paul, though he has a few words for masters, addresses slaves at much greater length. Probably Christian masters were comparatively few, while large numbers of slaves had embraced the religion which could do so much to comfort and elevate the oppressed. Again, the immediate purpose of the apostle is to inculcate submission to authority; therefore, having enforced upon Christian servants the example of their Lord, he proceeds to speak of the duty of Christian wives. Christianity was in its infancy; it was to be the means of abolishing slavery, and of raising woman to her proper place in society; but as yet slaves were cruelly oppressed, and women were ill treated and despised. Aristotle tells us that among the barbarians (and a large proportion of the population in the greater part of Asia Minor was barbarian, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> non-Greek) the woman and the slave hold the same rank ('Pol.,' I. 2:4). In Greek communities the case was different; but even among the Greeks women occupied a very subordinate position. Christianity would introduce a great and sweeping change in the relations of the sexes, as well as in the relations of master and slave. But the change must be gradual, not violent; it must be brought about by the softening and purifying influences of religion, not by revolt against recognized customs and established authority. Indeed, Christianity would introduce an element of division - the Lord had said so (<a href="/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>); families would be divided. It could not be otherwise; Christians must not set even family ties above the love of Christ. But Christian wives must be peacemakers; they must, as far as possible, live at peace even with unbelieving husbands. They would often have much ill treatment to endure in those coarse, cruel days; they must bear it with the quiet strength of gentleness. <span class="cmt_word">Be in subjection to your own husbands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">submitting yourselves.</span> The participle, as in <a href="/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, seems to look back to the imperative, "submit yourselves," in <a href="/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The present participle implies that this voluntary submission is to be habitual. The adjective "your own" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) emphasizes the duty. <span class="cmt_word">That, if any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives</span>. There is a well-supported reading, "Even if any." Husband and wife would often be converted together; but if this should not be the case, and if the unbelieving husband should set himself in direct opposition to the Word of God (for the words "believe not" have more than a negative meaning, as in <a href="/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>), still Christian wives must submit themselves. They must do this for the glory of God, and with the hope of saving their husbands' souls; that those unbelieving husbands may be won to Christ and to everlasting life by the silent eloquence of the quiet self-restraint and holy behavior of their wives, without argument or preaching on the wives' part. A self-denying holy life will do more to win those with whom we live in close intercourse than even holy words, and much more than debate and controversy. This seems to be the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rather than the other possible interpretation, "without the preaching of the Word." <span class="accented">Be won</span>; literally, <span class="accented">be gained.</span> Each soul converted is a gain to Christ, to the kingdom of heaven, to itself, in this case also to the wife who is the happy instrument of saving her husband (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19, 20</a>). The word rendered "conversation" here, as elsewhere, means "conduct, behavior."
