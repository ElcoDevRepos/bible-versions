The use of "He Himself" underscores that Jesus willingly took on this burden, aligning with <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>, which prophesies the suffering servant bearing the iniquities of many. The term "bore" suggests a substitutionary atonement, where Jesus takes upon Himself the sins of humanity, a concept rooted in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/16-22.htm">Leviticus 16:22</a>). "In His body" highlights the physical reality of Christ's suffering, countering early heresies that denied His humanity. The "tree" refers to the cross, connecting to <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, where being hung on a tree is associated with being cursed by God, illustrating the curse Jesus took upon Himself for our redemption.<p><b>so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness</b><br>This phrase indicates the purpose of Christ's sacrifice: transformation and sanctification of believers. "Die to sin" implies a decisive break from the power and penalty of sin, echoing <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2-11</a>, where believers are described as being dead to sin but alive to God in Christ. "Live to righteousness" suggests a new way of life characterized by obedience and holiness, reflecting the moral and ethical teachings of Jesus, such as the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). This transformation is not merely moral but spiritual, enabled by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>).<p><b>&#8220;By His stripes you are healed.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, linking Christ's suffering to the healing of believers. "Stripes" refers to the physical wounds inflicted on Jesus during His scourging, a common Roman practice before crucifixion, which fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant. The term "healed" can be understood both physically and spiritually, indicating the comprehensive nature of salvation. While some interpret this as physical healing, the broader context suggests spiritual restoration and reconciliation with God, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a> and <a href="/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>.

The verse answers both the &#8220;how&#8221; and the &#8220;why&#8221; of salvation&#8212;showing a Savior who does not merely forgive on paper but radically re-creates people for godly, healed life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Who his own self.</span>--This verse, like the "for you" in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm" title="For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:">1Peter 2:21</a>, is intended to make the readers feel the claims of gratitude, not to set before them another point in which Christ was to be imitated. But at the same time it serves to enforce still more strongly the two points already mentioned--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, sinlessness and suffering. So far was Christ from "doing sins," that He actually His own self bore ours, and in so doing endured the extremity of anguish "in His own body," so that He could sympathise with the corporal chastisements of these poor servants; and "on the tree," too, the wicked slave's death.<p><span class= "bld">Bare our sins . . . on the tree.</span>--This brings us face to face with a great mystery; and to add to the difficulty of the interpretation, almost each word is capable of being taken in several different ways. Most modern scholars are agreed to reject "<span class= "ital">on</span> the tree," in favour of the marginal "to," the proper meaning of the Greek preposition, when connected (as here) with the accusative, being what is expressed in colloquial English by the useful compound "<span class= "ital">on-to</span> the tree." It is, however, not obligatory to see motion consciously intended in this preposition and accusative everywhere. It is used, for instance, <a href="/mark/4-38.htm" title="And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say to him, Master, care you not that we perish?">Mark 4:38</a>, of sleeping <span class= "ital">on</span> the pillow; in <a href="/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>, of the veil resting <span class= "ital">upon</span> their hearts; in <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>, of the elders sitting <span class= "ital">upon</span> their thrones. This word, then, will give us but little help to discover the meaning of the word translated "bare." (1) That verb means literally "to carry or take up," and is used thus in <a href="/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>, <a href="/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.">Mark 9:2</a>, of taking the disciples up the Mount of Transfiguration; and in <a href="/luke/24-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.">Luke 24:51</a>, of Jesus being carried up into heaven: therefore Hammond, Grimm, and others would here understand it to be, "He carried our sins up with Him on-to the tree," there to expiate them by His death. (2) A much commoner meaning of the word is that which it bears in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>, "to offer up" (so also in <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15</a>; <a href="/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">James 2:21</a>). The substantive formed from it (<span class= "ital">Anaphora</span>) is still the liturgical term for the sacrificial section of the Eucharistic service. This interpretation is somewhat tempting, because the very preposition here used, with the very same case, appears in <a href="/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">James 2:21</a>, and frequently in the Old Testament, together with our present verb, for "to offer up <span class= "ital">upon</span> the altar." In this way it would be, "He offered up our sins in His own body <span class= "ital">on the altar of</span> the cross." So Luther and others take it. This would be perfect, were it not for the strangeness of regarding the sins themselves as a sacrifice to be offered on the altar. The only way to make sense of it in that case would be to join very closely "our sins in His own body"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as contained and gathered up in His own sinless body, which might come to nearly the same thing as saying that He "offered up His own body laden with our sins" upon that altar. (3) Both these renderings, however, pass over the fact that St. Peter is referring to Isaiah 53. In the English version of that chapter, "hath borne," "shall bear," "bare," appears in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11-12</a>, indifferently; but the Hebrew is not the same in each case, for in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a> the word for "shall bear" is identical with that rightly rendered "carry" in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>, and has not the same signification as that which appears as "to bear" in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>. The difference between these two Hebrew roots seems to be that the verb <span class= "ital">sabal</span> in <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a> means "to carry," as a porter carries a load, or as our Lord carried His cross; while the verb <span class= "ital">nasa</span>,' used in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, means rather "to lift or raise," which might, of course, be the action preparatory to that other of "carrying." Now, the Greek word which we have here undoubtedly better represents <span class= "ital">nasa'</span> than <span class= "ital">sabal, </span>but the question is complicated by the fact that the LXX. uses it to express both alike in <a href="/context/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11-12</a>, observing at the same time the distinction between "iniquities" and "sin," while in <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> (where again it reads "our sins" instead of "our griefs") it adopts a simpler verb; and St. Peter's language here seems to be affected by all three passages. The expression "our sins" (which comes in so strangely with the use of "you" all round) seems a reminiscence of <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm" title="To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,">1Peter 2:4</a> (LXX.). The order in which the words occur is precisely the order of <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1Peter 2:11</a>, and the tense points to <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>, as well as the parallel use in <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, where the presence of the words "of many" proves that the writer was thinking of <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>. We cannot say for certain, then, whether St. Peter meant to represent <span class= "ital">nasa'</span> or <span class= "ital">sabal.</span> We have some clue, however, to the way in which the Greek word was used, by finding it in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, where the "whoredoms" of the fathers are said to be "borne" by their children (the Hebrew there being <span class= "ital">nasa'</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Many instances in classical Greek lead to the conclusion that in such cases it implies something being <span class= "ital">laid</span> or <span class= "ital">inflicted</span> from without upon the person who "bears." Thus, in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a>, it will be, "your children will <span class= "ital">have to</span> bear your whoredoms," or, "will have laid upon them your whoredoms." In <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a> it will be, "Christ was once for all presented (at the altar), to have the sins of many laid upon Him." Here it will be, "Who His own self had our sins laid upon His body on the tree." Then comes a further question. The persons who hold the substitute theory of the Atonement assert that "our sins" here stands for "the <span class= "ital">punishment</span> of our sins." This is, however, to use violence with words; we might with as good reason translate <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm" title="Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:">1Peter 2:22</a>, "Who did, or performed, no punishment for sin." St. Peter asserts that Christ, in His boundless sympathy with fallen man, in His union with all mankind through the Incarnation whereby He became the second Adam, actually took, as His own, our sins, as well as everything else belonging to us. He was so identified with us, that in the great Psalm of the Messianic sacrifice, He calls them "My sins" (<a href="/psalms/40-12.htm" title="For innumerable evils have compassed me about: my iniquities have taken hold on me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head: therefore my heart fails me.">Psalm 40:12</a>), sinless as He was. (See St. Matthew's interpretation of the same thought, <a href="/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who his own self, bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</span> St. Peter has thus far spoken of our Lord as our Example of patient endurance; but he seems to feel that, although this is the aspect of the Savior's sufferings most suitable to his present purpose, yet it is scarcely seemly to dwell upon that most momentous of all events, the death of Christ our Lord upon the cross, without mentioning its more solemn and awful import. A martyr may be an example of patient suffering; he cannot bear our sins. The apostle proceeds to unfold the contents of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 21. The Lord <span class="accented">died for</span> us: but what is the meaning of the preposition? Was it that his example might stimulate us to imitate his patience and his holy courage? This is a <span class="accented">true</span> view, but, taken alone, it would be utterly inadequate. The death of the Son of God had a far deeper significance. The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> used here and elsewhere is explained by the more precise <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> of <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, in which last passage both propositions are combined. The Lord died, not only in our behalf, but in our stead. He gave "his life a ransom for many;" "he is the Propitiation for our sins." St. Peter exhibits here, with all possible emphasis, this vicarious aspect of the Savior's death. "He bore our sins <span class="accented">himself</span>." The pronoun is strongly emphatic; he bore them, though they were not his own. They were <span class="accented">our</span> sins, but <span class="accented">he</span> bore them - he alone; none other could bear that awful burden. <span class="accented">He bare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle is evidently quoting <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Hebrew verb is ?and the Septuagint Version is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>; comp. vers. 4 and 11 (in ver. 11 there is another Hebrew verb) of the same chapter. In the Old Testament "to bear <span class="accented">sins"</span> or "iniquity" means to suffer the punishment of sin, whether one's own sin or the sin of others (see <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1, 17</a>, and many similar passages). In the description of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. it is said (Ver. 22) that the scapegoat "shall bear upon him [the Hebrew is ; the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>] all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited," where the scapegoat is represented as bearing the sins of the people and taking them away. Compare also the great saying of the Baptist, "Behold the Lamb of God. which taketh away the sin of the world!" where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be rendered with equal exactness, "who beareth," or "who taketh away." The Lord took our sins away by taking them upon himself (comp. <a href="/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>). As Aaron put the sins of the people upon the head of the scapegoat (<a href="/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>), and the goat was to bear them upon him unto a land not inhabited, so the Lord laid on the blessed Savior the iniquity of us all, and he bare our sins in his own body on to the tree, and, there dying in our stead, took them away. He bare them on himself, as the scapegoat bare upon him the iniquities of Israel. It was this burden of sin which made his sacred body sweat great drops of blood in his awful agony. He bare them on to the tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); he carried them thither, and there he expiated them (comp. <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," where the same Greek word is used - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). Another interpretation takes <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in its sacrificial sense, as in <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, and regards the cross as the altar: "<span class="accented">He</span> bore our sins on to the altar of the cross." The Lord is both Priest and Victim, and the verb is used in the sacred writings both of the priest who offers the sacrifice and of the sacrifice which bears or takes away sin. But the sacrifice which the Lord offered up was himself, not our sins; therefore it seems best to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> here rather of victim than of priest, as in <a href="/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a> and the Greek Version of <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The thought of sacrifice was doubtless present to the apostle's mind, as it certainly was to the prophet's (see ver. 10 of <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.). The word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used for the cross twice in St. Peter's speeches in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>). It is also so used by St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Bengel understands it differently. He says that as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means "to become the slave of some one," so <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> may mean to cease to be a slave. But this would require the genitive, not the dative, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and the ordinary translation is more suitable to the following context. The word is several times used in Herodotus in the sense of "having died;" more literally, "having ceased to be." The tense (aorist) seems to point to a definite time, as the time of baptism (comp. <a href="/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>). Righteousness here is simply the opposite of sin - obedience, submission to the will of God. Bengel says, "Justitia tota una est; peccatum multiplex." <span class="cmt_word">By whose stripes ye were healed</span>. The apostle is quoting the Septuagint rendering of <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c8;</span> means the mark or weal left on the flesh by a scourge (comp. Ecclus. 28:17, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The slaves, whom the apostle is addressing, might perhaps not infrequently be subjected to the scourge; he bids them remember the more dreadful flagellation which the Lord endured. They were to learn patience of him, and to remember to their comfort that those stripes which he, the holy Son of God, condescended to suffer are to them that believe healing and salvation. Faith in the crucified Savior lifts the Christian out of the sickness of sin into the health of righteousness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8003;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Himself</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
