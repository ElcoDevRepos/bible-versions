The "family of God" refers to believers, the church, who are seen as God's household. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where judgment often began with God's people (<a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>). The idea is that God purifies His people first, ensuring they are living in accordance with His will. This reflects the principle that those who have received greater revelation and responsibility are held to a higher standard (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>). The judgment here is not necessarily punitive but can be seen as corrective, aimed at refining and purifying the church.<p><b>and if it begins with us,</b><br>The "us" refers to the Christian community, including Peter and his audience. This personalizes the message, emphasizing that believers are not exempt from God's scrutiny. The early church faced persecution and trials, which were seen as part of this judgment process. The trials served to test and strengthen their faith (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>). This also echoes the broader biblical theme that God's people are often tested to prove their faithfulness, as seen in the stories of Job and Abraham.<p><b>what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the severity of judgment for those outside the faith. "Those who disobey the gospel" refers to non-believers who reject the message of Christ. The implication is that if God's own people are subject to judgment, the fate of those who reject Him will be even more severe. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who warned of the consequences of unbelief (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>). The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the eternal implications of rejecting the gospel, highlighting the urgency of evangelism and the need for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.">Ezekiel 9:6</a> (comp. also <a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm" title="For, see, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, said the LORD of hosts.">Jeremiah 25:29</a>). Who are meant by the "house of God" is clear, not only from such passages as <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2Thessalonians 2:4</a>, but also from the immediate addition, "and if first <span class= "ital">at us.</span>" We who are <span class= "ital">Chrestiani, </span>who bear the mark of the Christ's shame upon our foreheads, and are not ashamed of it, are quite safe in this judgment: "come not near any man upon whom is the mark." The sense is a little closely packed. It seems as if St. Peter meant at first only to say, "Thank God that you <span class= "ital">are</span> 'Christians,' for the judgment is just about to begin," as something which only concerns the unbelievers; then, as an afterthought, he adds, "and begin, too, at the house of God," by way of making the believers also feel the need of care. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.</span> The house of God is the Church (see <a href="/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; and <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). The judgment must begin at the sanctuary (<a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>; see also <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>). The beginning of judgment is the persecution of the Christians, as our Lord had taught (<a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8, 9</a>, and following verses); but that judgment is not unto condemnation: "When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world" (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>); it is the fiery trial, "which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth," the refining fire of affliction. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? Compare the passage in Jeremiah already referred to: "Behold, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my Name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?" Compare also our Lord's question, "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" Gerhard (quoted by Huther) rightly remarks," Exaggeratio est in interrogatione." The question suggests answers too awful for words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For [it is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time [for]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kairos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2540.htm">Strong's 2540: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fitting season, season, opportunity, occasion, time.
