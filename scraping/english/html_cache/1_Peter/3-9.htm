In the context of the early church, believers often faced persecution and hostility. The instruction not to repay evil with evil echoes Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-39</a>), where He advocates turning the other cheek. This principle is rooted in the understanding that vengeance belongs to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>) and that believers are called to a higher standard of conduct, reflecting the character of Christ, who did not retaliate when He suffered (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><b>or insult with insult</b><br>The call to refrain from responding to insults with insults aligns with the broader biblical teaching on controlling one's tongue (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>). In the Greco-Roman world, honor and shame were significant cultural values, and insults could provoke strong reactions. However, Christians are encouraged to break this cycle of verbal retaliation, demonstrating the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in their lives. This approach is consistent with <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, which highlights the power of a gentle answer to turn away wrath.<p><b>but with blessing</b><br>Instead of responding negatively, believers are instructed to respond with blessing. This reflects the radical nature of Christian love, which seeks the good of others, even those who are adversaries. Jesus exemplified this on the cross, praying for those who crucified Him (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). The call to bless others, including enemies, is a practical outworking of the command to love one's neighbor (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). It also serves as a witness to the transformative power of the gospel, which enables believers to act contrary to human nature.<p><b>because to this you were called</b><br>The phrase underscores the divine calling of believers to live out these principles. This calling is not merely a suggestion but an integral part of the Christian identity and mission. It reflects the broader biblical theme of being set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The calling to bless others, even in the face of hostility, is part of the believer's vocation to be a light in the world (<a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>) and to reflect the character of Christ.<p><b>so that you may inherit a blessing</b><br>The promise of inheriting a blessing serves as motivation and assurance for believers. This inheritance is both present and future, encompassing the spiritual blessings in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>) and the ultimate hope of eternal life (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). The concept of inheritance is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where it often referred to the Promised Land. In the New Testament, it takes on a spiritual dimension, signifying the fullness of salvation and the believer's eternal reward. This promise encourages believers to persevere in doing good, knowing that their labor in the Lord is not in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Though the word is chosen as the exact opposite of the bad <span class= "ital">language</span> used against the Christians, "blessing" may perhaps involve the opposite of unkind <span class= "ital">action</span> as well.
