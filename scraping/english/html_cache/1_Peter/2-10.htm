In the Old Testament, Israel was considered God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The Gentiles were often seen as outsiders and not part of God's promises. This echoes <a href="/hosea/1-9.htm">Hosea 1:9-10</a>, where God speaks of those who were "not my people" becoming "children of the living God." The transformation from not being a people to becoming God's people signifies the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant through Christ.<p><b>but now you are the people of God</b><br>Through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, Gentiles are grafted into the family of God (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>). This inclusion fulfills the promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The church, composed of both Jews and Gentiles, is now considered the spiritual Israel (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>). This reflects the unity and universality of the gospel message, breaking down the dividing wall between Jew and Gentile (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>once you had not received mercy</b><br>Before coming to faith in Christ, Gentiles were outside the covenant of mercy that God had extended to Israel. Mercy in the biblical sense often refers to God's compassion and forgiveness towards humanity. The lack of mercy signifies a state of separation from God and His promises. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>, where Paul describes the Gentiles as "excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise."<p><b>but now you have received mercy</b><br>Receiving mercy is a central theme of the New Testament, highlighting God's grace extended to all through Jesus Christ. This mercy is not earned but given freely through faith in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). The transformation from not receiving mercy to receiving it underscores the new covenant established by Jesus' sacrifice, which offers forgiveness and reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10-12</a>). This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where salvation is extended to the ends of the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally credited with writing this epistle.

We moved from anonymity to belonging, from judgment to mercy, from isolation to family. The verse reassures believers that our status is settled: we are God&#8217;s people, permanently marked by His mercy, and nothing can reverse what He has declared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Which in time past were not a people.</span>--Here at last, say some, we have a distinct proof that the Epistle was written to the Gentiles only, or, at least, to churches which contained a very small proportion of Jews. Such, however, is by no means the case; in fact, the opposite. We have here an emphasised adaptation of <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm" title="And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are my God.">Hosea 2:23</a>, "And I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah, and I will say to Lo-ammi, 'Thou art Animi,' <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>My people." Now who were Lo-ruhamah and Lo-ammi? Types of Israel left unpitied, and rejected from their covenant with God. And this unpitied and rejected Israel, after being "scattered," or <span class= "ital">sown, </span>all over the earth, was to be restored again to favour, together with the increment of the Gentiles who joined, it as the result of the "sowing." St. Peter means, then, that in his Hebrew readers and the brethren from among the Gentiles, who by the gospel of St. Paul had adhered to them, this promise given by Hosea had found its fulfilment. But, as usual, the quotation demands a more searching scrutiny of the context from which it is taken. The name <span class= "ital">Diaspora, </span>or Dispersion, by which St. Peter, in <a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1Peter 1:1</a>, designates those to whom he writes, was applied to themselves by the Jews in direct allusion (as seems probable) to the name Jezreel, or <span class= "ital">God will scatter, </span>in <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.">Hosea 1:4</a>. Now mark that St. Peter does not say "which in time past were not God's people," but "were not <span class= "ital">a</span> people." This was the effect of the dispersion, or "scattering." Though each Jew of the dispersion retained, and still retains, in isolation, his national characteristics and aspirations, yet their unity--that which made them a "people"--was, and is, for the time broken. The Hebrews had not only ceased to be in covenant as "God's people," but had ceased to be "a people" at all. But in Christ, that very "scattering" becomes a "sowing" (<a href="/hosea/2-23.htm" title="And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, You are my people; and they shall say, You are my God.">Hosea 2:23</a>), for the name Jezreel means both equally; their very dispersion becomes the means of their multiplication by union with the Gentiles in Christ, and thus spiritually they recover the lost unity, and become once more a solid and well-governed confederation, <span class= "ital">i.e., "</span>a people," and that "the people of God." (See <a href="/john/11-52.htm" title="And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.">John 11:52</a>, and Dr. Pusey's notes on Hosea.) It is a mistake to take St. Paul's quotation of this passage in <a href="/romans/9-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.">Romans 9:26</a>, as if it referred solely to the Gentiles; for he expressly affirms that the title "My people" belongs to neither section exclusively, but to both in reunion--"us whom He called, <span class= "ital">not only</span> of the Jews, but <span class= "ital">also</span> of the Gentiles." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God.</span> St. Peter quotes the prophecy of Hosea (<a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>), as St. Paul also does in <a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25, 26</a>. And as St. Paul applies the prophet's words (said originally of the Jews) to the Christian Church, to those called "not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles," so apparently does St. Peter here. They were not a people; "Ne populus quidem," says Bengel, "nedum Dei populus."
