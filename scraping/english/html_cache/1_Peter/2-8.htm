In the context of 1 Peter, the imagery of a stone is significant because it highlights the rejection of Jesus by the Jewish leaders and many of His contemporaries. The metaphor of a "stone of stumbling" suggests that Jesus, while being the foundation for believers, becomes a barrier for those who reject Him. This duality is central to understanding the role of Christ in salvation history. The "rock of offense" indicates that the message of the cross is a scandal to those who do not believe, as Paul also notes in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>.<p><b>They stumble because they disobey the word&#8212;</b><br>The stumbling is directly linked to disobedience to the word of God, which in this context refers to the gospel message. This disobedience is not merely a passive act but an active rejection of the truth revealed in Jesus Christ. The concept of stumbling is often used in Scripture to describe a spiritual downfall or failure to recognize God's plan, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32-33</a>. The disobedience here is a willful choice, highlighting human responsibility in responding to God's revelation.<p><b>and to this they were appointed.</b><br>This phrase touches on the doctrine of divine sovereignty and election. It suggests that God, in His omniscience, has appointed the consequences of disobedience for those who reject His word. This does not imply that God causes unbelief, but rather that He has foreordained the outcome of rejecting Christ. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18-22</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereign right to show mercy or harden hearts. The appointment here underscores the seriousness of rejecting the gospel and the inevitable judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle.

Here there is no thought whatever of the stone as a material for building; the thought is that of a mass of rock on the road, on which the terror-stricken fugitives stumble and fall. The words are taken from <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>, and are translated directly from the Hebrew. The LXX. not only makes nonsense, but can again be hardly acquitted of "guile" (<a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1Peter 2:1</a>) in its endeavour to make out the best possible case for Israel by deliberately inserting the word "not" twice over. We shall find St. Peter in <a href="/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1Peter 3:14</a> quoting the verses which immediately precede our present citation, and again the point lies in the context. The words are no mere phrase hastily caught up to serve the turn. They come out of the great Immanuel section of Isaiah, and immediately involve, like the quotation in <a href="/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1Peter 2:6</a>, the sharp contrast between the Jews who trust in Immanuel (the presence of God with Israel) and the Jews who do not, but rely on "confederacies." To the one party, the Lord of Hosts will be "for a sanctuary;" but to the other party, who are described as "both houses of Israel," and specially as the "inhabitant of Jerusalem," He will be "for a stone of striking, and for a rock of stumbling over," and also "for a snare." The "sanctuary" does not seem to mean a temple (though this would connect it with the preceding words of St. Peter), but rather such a "sanctuary" as that of Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm" title="And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil on the top of it.">Genesis 28:18</a>), a consecrated stone to which a man might flee as an asylum. In the flight of terror before the face of the Assyrians the very stone which afforded right of sanctuary to those who recognised and trusted it, was a vexatious and dangerous obstacle, a trap full in the way to those who did not. Once more, therefore, the Hebrews of the Dispersion, in separating themselves from "both houses of Israel" and the "inhabitant of Jerusalem," were obeying the warnings of the Immanuel prophecy, which every Hebrew recognised as Messianic. Though the coupling of these passages of the Old Testament together certainly seems to show traces of the influence of St. Paul (comp. <a href="/context/romans/9-32.htm" title="Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone;">Romans 9:32-33</a>), yet St. Peter must have been present and heard "the Lord of Hosts" Himself put them together (<a href="/context/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17-18</a>), and probably St. Paul's use of the passages is itself to be traced back to the same origin. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense</span>. St. Peter combines <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> with his first quotations, as St. Paul also does (Ram. 9:33), both apostles quoting from the Hebrew, not from the Septuagint, which is quite different, inserting two negatives. The living Stone is not only made the Head of the corner to the confusion of the disobedient, but becomes also to their destruction a Stone of stumbling; they fall on that Stone, and are broken (<a href="/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). That Stone is a Rock (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the Rock of Ages, the Rock on which the Church is built; but to the disobedient it is a Rock of offense (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">in Attic Greek</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is properly the catch or spring of a trap, which makes animals fall into the trap; then a stumbling-block - anything which causes men to fall.

It must refer either to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> - sin is punished by sin; for sin in God's awful judgment hardens the heart; the disobedient are in danger of eternal sin (<a href="/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>, according to the two oldest manuscripts) - or, more probably, to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; it is God's ordinance that disobedience should end in stumbling; but that stumbling does not necessarily imply condemnation (see <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). The word, the preaching of Christ crucified, was to the Jews a stumbling-block (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). But not all stumbled that they might fall. Nevertheless, perseverance in disobedience must end in everlasting death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;A stone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#923;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Lithos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3037.htm">Strong's 3037: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stone; met: of Jesus as the chief stone in a building.
