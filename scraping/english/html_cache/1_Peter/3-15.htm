The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Sanctifying Christ as Lord means setting Him apart as holy and sovereign in one's life. This echoes the call to holiness found in <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44</a> and is a personal commitment to live under Christ's authority. The early Christians faced persecution, and this internal sanctification was crucial for maintaining faith amidst external pressures. It also reflects the Shema from <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where believers are called to love God with all their heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of readiness and preparedness in the Christian life. The term "defense" (Greek: apologia) suggests a reasoned argument or explanation, akin to a legal defense. This implies that believers should be knowledgeable about their faith and able to articulate why they hold their beliefs. The "hope" refers to the confident expectation of salvation and eternal life through Jesus Christ, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>). The early church was often questioned and challenged, necessitating a well-grounded understanding of their faith. This readiness is not just intellectual but also spiritual, relying on the Holy Spirit for wisdom and guidance (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p><b>But respond with gentleness and respect,</b><br>This phrase highlights the manner in which believers should engage with others, especially when discussing their faith. Gentleness and respect are key Christian virtues, reflecting the character of Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>). This approach is crucial in maintaining a witness that is both truthful and loving, avoiding arrogance or hostility. The cultural context of the early church involved interactions with both Jews and Gentiles, requiring sensitivity and respect for differing beliefs and backgrounds. This aligns with Paul's exhortation in <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a> to let one's conversation be "full of grace, seasoned with salt." The emphasis on gentleness and respect ensures that the defense of the faith is not only about winning arguments but also about winning hearts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

The passage, as it stands in Isaiah, runs literally, "Jehovah Sabaoth, Him shall ye sanctify, and He (shall be) your fear, and He your dread." It becomes, therefore, very striking when we find that, without a shadow of doubt, the right reading here is, <span class= "ital">But sanctify the Lord the Christ in your hearts.</span> How is it possible, except on the supposition that the Catholic doctrine is really a statement of fact, that a Jew like St. Peter should ever have come to apply to a Man whom he had known familiarly, a Man who had served him at table and had washed his feet, the words which Isaiah had said about the "Lord of Hosts?" This passage immediately precedes that which was quoted in <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>, and (like that) is not caught up at random, but as coming in the great Immanuel passage. That presence of God which was the palladium of Israel in the days of Hezekiah has found fulfilment in "the Christ" now given. But what is meant by "sanctifying" Him? The phrase is not elsewhere used in the New Testament, except in the Lord's Prayer; but in the Old Testament see <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm" title="Then Moses said to Aaron, This is it that the LORD spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm" title="But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm" title="Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 38:23</a>. As to "glorify" God means (in word and deed) to recognise His glorious perfections; as to "magnify" Him means to recognise His greatness; as to "justify" Him means to recognise His inherent justice; so to "sanctify" Him means to recognise, in word and deed, His full holiness, and therefore to treat Him with due awe. This not only substitutes the fear of God for the fear of man (since they mutually exclude each other), but enforces purity of life, thus catching up again "that which is good" and "for righteousness' sake." This, adds St. Peter, is to be done "in your hearts." This does not mean simply "<span class= "ital">with</span> your hearts," or "<span class= "ital">from</span> your hearts" (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>inwardly, or, with all sincerity and devotion), but it signifies the local habitation where the Christ is to be thus recognised. That is to say: St. Peter, like St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>), acknowledges an indwelling of <span class= "ital">C</span>hrist in the hearts of the faithful; and this indwelling not merely subjective, consisting of their constant recollection of him, but real and objective: there He is, as in a shrine, and they must pay due reverence to His presence. The Apostle does, in fact, in those words "in your hearts," purposely call attention to the difference between Isaiah's use of the name Immanuel and the Christian meaning of it. To Isaiah, God dwelt in the midst of a people in its corporate capacity; St. Peter knew that, through the Incarnation, each individual Christian has God in him, united with him.<p><span class= "bld">And be.</span>--The better reading omits the connecting particle, so that we should put "being" instead of "and be." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.</span> From <a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>. The reading of the best and oldest manuscripts here is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sanctify the Lord Christ," or, "Sanctify the Christ as Lord." The absence of the article with <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> in favor of the second translation; but the first seems more natural, more in accordance with the original passage in Isaiah, and the common expression, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, is in its favor. Whichever translation is adopted, St. Peter here substitutes the Savior's Name where the prophet wrote, "the Lord of hosts, Jehovah Sabaoth" - a change which would be nothing less than impious if the Lord Jesus Christ were not truly God. "Sanctify him," the apostle says (as the Lord himself teaches us to say, in the first words of the Lord's Prayer); that is, regard him as most holy, awful in sanctity; serve him with reverence and godly fear; so you will not "be afraid of their terror." The holy fear of God will lift you above the fear of man. "Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" (<a href="/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; see also <a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>). St. Peter adds the words, "in your hearts," to teach us that this reverence, this hallowing of the Name of God, must be inward and spiritual, in our inmost being. <span class="cmt_word">And be ready always to give an answer to every man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ready always for an apology to every man.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is often used of a formal answer before a magistrate, or of a written defense of the faith; but here the addition, "to every man," shows that St. Peter is thinking of informal answers on any suitable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">That asketh you a reason of the here that is in you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">an account concerning the hope.</span> Hope is the grace on which St. Peter lays most stress; it lives in the hearts of Christians. Christians ought to be able to give an account of their hope when asked, both for the defense of the truth and for the good of the asker. That account may be very simple; it may be the mere recital of personal experience - often the most convincing of arguments; it may be, in the case of instructed Christians, profound and closely reasoned. Some answer every Christian ought to be able to give. <span class="cmt_word">With meekness and fear</span>. The best manuscripts read, "but with meekness and fear." The word "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>) is emphatic; argument always involves danger of weakening the spiritual life through pride or bitterness. We must sometimes "contend earnestly for the faith;" but it must be with gentleness and awe. We should fear lest we injure our own souls by arrogant and angry controversy; we should seek the spiritual good of our opponents; and we should entertain a solemn awe of the presence of God, with a trembling anxiety to think and to say only what is acceptable unto him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
