In the New Testament, stewardship extends to spiritual gifts and the grace bestowed upon believers. The term "manifold" suggests the diverse and multifaceted nature of God's grace, indicating that it is abundant and varied, meeting the needs of the church in numerous ways. This aligns with the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where servants are entrusted with resources and expected to manage them wisely. The idea of stewardship implies accountability and responsibility, emphasizing that believers are to manage God's gifts not for personal gain but for the benefit of the community and the glory of God.<p><b>each of you should use whatever gift he has received</b><br>This phrase underscores the individual responsibility of each believer to recognize and utilize their unique spiritual gifts. The Apostle Paul elaborates on spiritual gifts in <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, where he describes the church as one body with many parts, each having different functions. This diversity in gifts is intended to promote unity and edification within the church. The gifts are not self-generated but are received from God, highlighting the grace aspect of their distribution. The emphasis is on active participation and contribution to the body of Christ, rather than passivity or neglect of one's gifts.<p><b>to serve one another</b><br>Service is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus, who exemplified servanthood by washing the disciples' feet (<a href="/john/13.htm">John 13:1-17</a>) and ultimately through His sacrificial death on the cross. The call to serve one another reflects the second greatest commandment, to love your neighbor as yourself (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). In the early church, this service was manifested in communal living and sharing of resources (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>). The use of spiritual gifts for service is not only a demonstration of love but also a means of building up the church, fostering community, and advancing the mission of the gospel. This service-oriented approach counters the cultural norms of self-promotion and individualism, instead promoting humility and selflessness as modeled by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.
