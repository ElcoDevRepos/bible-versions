In the Roman Empire, Christians were often marginalized and insulted for their faith in Jesus Christ, who was seen as a threat to traditional Roman religious practices. The phrase "for the name of Christ" emphasizes that the insults are specifically due to their identification with Jesus, aligning with Jesus' own teachings in <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>, where He speaks of being blessed when persecuted for His sake. This reflects the early church's understanding of suffering as a participation in Christ's own sufferings.<p><b>you are blessed</b><br>The concept of being "blessed" in the face of persecution is counterintuitive but deeply rooted in biblical teaching. This echoes the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus pronounces blessings on those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. The blessing here is not necessarily material or immediate but is spiritual and eternal, indicating God's favor and approval. It also suggests a future reward, as seen in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where those who endure trials are promised the crown of life.<p><b>because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you</b><br>This phrase draws on Old Testament imagery, particularly from <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, where the Spirit of the Lord is described as resting upon the Messiah. The "Spirit of glory" suggests the Shekinah glory, the divine presence that dwelt in the tabernacle and temple, now resting upon believers. This indicates that those who suffer for Christ are not abandoned but are indwelt and empowered by the Holy Spirit. The presence of the Spirit is a mark of God's approval and a source of strength and comfort, as seen in <a href="/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>, where Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, sees the glory of God even as he is being martyred.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

He Himself warned, &#8220;If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>). Peter assumes such opposition, treating it as an expected part of Christian life. Note how Scripture consistently prepares believers:<p>&#8226; &#8220;All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Blessed are you when people hate you, exclude you and insult you&#8221; (<a href="/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>).<p>These verses remind us that personal attacks for faith are not signs of failure but confirmations that we belong to Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the name of Christ</b><p>The verse narrows the cause of the insult: it is &#8220;for the name of Christ,&#8221; not for personal faults. Peter already urged, &#8220;If you suffer for doing good, you are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>). The apostles rejoiced after being flogged, &#8220;because they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the Name&#8221; (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). The &#8220;Name&#8221; represents Jesus&#8217; person, authority, and reputation. When believers endure contempt specifically because they identify with Him, heaven recognizes that suffering as honorable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are blessed</b><p>Far from being pitied, Christians under verbal attack are congratulated by God. This echoes the Sermon on the Mount: &#8220;Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness&#8230; Rejoice and be glad&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10&#8211;12</a>). James adds, &#8220;Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). The blessing is present&#8212;comfort, joy, strength&#8212;and future&#8212;eternal reward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the Spirit of glory</b><p>Why the blessing? &#8220;Because the Spirit of glory&#8230; rests on you.&#8221; The Holy Spirit, termed &#8220;the Spirit of glory,&#8221; brings God&#8217;s radiant presence into the believer&#8217;s life, especially in hardship. Paul wrote, &#8220;We&#8230; are being transformed into His image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>). Even when outward circumstances darken, the Spirit shines within, guaranteeing that present sufferings &#8220;are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of God rests on you</b><p>The Spirit does not merely visit; He &#8220;rests&#8221; on the sufferer&#8212;an image of settled, continual presence. Isaiah foretold, &#8220;The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>), and that same abiding presence now rests on every believer. God told Moses, &#8220;My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). Peter affirms this promise for Christians experiencing hostility. We are God&#8217;s dwelling place&#8212;&#8220;Do you not know that you are God&#8217;s temple and that God&#8217;s Spirit dwells in you?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). His settled rest guarantees comfort, courage, and unbroken fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Insults for Christ are not setbacks but divine appointments. Suffering that springs from loyalty to Jesus brings immediate blessing, because the Holy Spirit&#8212;described as the Spirit of glory&#8212;settles upon the believer with sustaining power and radiant presence. Far from being abandoned, the Christian under fire is marked by heaven&#8217;s approval and enveloped by God&#8217;s abiding rest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">If ye be reproached</span>.--The form of speech denotes that they <span class= "ital">were</span> so reproached.<p><span class= "bld">For the name of Christ.</span>--Literally, "<span class= "ital">in</span> the name of Christ," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>on the score of being Christians only.

It expresses that glory--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the triumphant manifestation of perfections--is His <span class= "ital">gift</span> and His distinguishing sign and the atmosphere in which He lives. "Glory" stands in contrast with "reproach." And lest it should be doubted who was meant by the splendid phrase, the Apostle adds, "and of God." All "glory" is His, and therefore the Spirit which is the "Spirit of glory" can be no other than the "Spirit of God;" but as God Himself is greater than His own glory, the words form a climax, and it means more to call Him the "Spirit of God" than to call Him the "Spirit of glory." And this Spirit "resteth" upon the persecuted Christians. It means far more than "remaineth" or "abideth." It expresses the complete repose and satisfaction with which the Spirit of glory abides on men who have the hearts of martyrs. "This shall be My rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein." It is the word which is used of the quiet retreat which our Lord took after John's death (<a href="/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a>; of the calm relief which He offers to the weary souls who come to Him (<a href="/context/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28-29</a>); of the repose of the blessed dead after the work of life is over (<a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). In the Old Testament it is used of the Spirit in <a href="/numbers/11-25.htm" title="And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was on him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, and did not cease.">Numbers 11:25</a>, and <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm" title="And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.">2Kings 2:15</a>; but, above all, in <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which was probably in St. Peter's mind. And the argument is, that reproach for the name of the Christ is a proof of glory in reserve, or rather, already belonging to the man. Perhaps St. Peter intentionally hints (in speaking of the "Spirit") that all who make themselves partakers of Christ's reproach are made partakers of His chrism. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are ye</span>; rather, <span class="accented">if ye are reviled in the -Name of Christ, blessed are ye.</span> There is, again, a manifest quotation of our Lord's words in <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>. The conjunction "if" does not imply any doubt: the words mean "when ye are reviled." For "in the Name of Christ," camp. <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>, "Whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my Name, because ye belong to Christ." So here the meaning is, "<span class="accented">When</span> ye are reviled because ye belong to Christ, because ye bear his Name, because ye are Christians" (camp, <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you</span>. The form of the sentence in the Greek is unusual. Some regard the first clause, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, as a periphrasis for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, and translate, "For glory and the Spirit of God resteth upon you." But there is no other instance of such a periphrasis in the New Testament (Winer, 3:18. 3); it is better to supply <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="accented">M</span>en revile them, but God glorifieth them. The Spirit of glory, the Spirit which hath the glorious attributes of God, the Spirit which proceedeth from the Father who dwelleth in the glory, in the Shechinah, - that Spirit resteth upon them, and sheds on them the glory of holy suffering, the glory which hung around the cross of Christ. Two of the most ancient manuscripts, with some others, insert the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "the Spirit of glory, and of power, and of God." The Spirit is power from on high (<a href="/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>). (For "resteth," comp. <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>.) <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with the accusative suggests the thought of the Spirit descending upon them and resting there (comp. <a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32, 33</a>). The Spirit abides upon those who patiently suffer for Christ. <span class="cmt_word">On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</span> These words are not found in the most ancient manuscripts, and are probably a gloss, lint a true one. Those who reviled the suffering Christians really blasphemed the Holy Spirit of God, by whom they were strengthened; the Holy Spirit was glorified by their patient endurance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(Ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
