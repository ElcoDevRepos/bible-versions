In the biblical context, the conscience is the inner sense of right and wrong, informed by the Holy Spirit. Paul also emphasizes the importance of a clear conscience in <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>, where he strives to maintain a blameless conscience before God and man. The idea is that a clear conscience allows believers to stand firm in their faith, even when facing opposition or persecution.<p><b>so that those who slander you</b><br>Slander was a common issue faced by early Christians, as they were often misunderstood and misrepresented by the surrounding pagan culture. The Roman Empire, with its diverse religious practices, viewed Christianity with suspicion. Christians were sometimes accused of atheism for not worshiping the Roman gods, and of subversion for their allegiance to Christ as King. This phrase acknowledges the reality of false accusations and the need for believers to be prepared to respond with integrity.<p><b>may be put to shame</b><br>The concept of being put to shame is rooted in the idea of vindication. In the biblical narrative, God often vindicates His people by revealing the truth and exposing falsehood. This is seen in the story of Daniel, where his accusers are ultimately shamed when God delivers Daniel from the lions' den (Daniel 6). The shame here is not about personal revenge but about the hope that the truth of the Gospel will be evident, leading to the repentance and transformation of the accusers.<p><b>by your good behavior in Christ</b><br>Good behavior in Christ refers to living a life that reflects the teachings and character of Jesus. This includes the fruits of the Spirit as outlined in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. The early church was known for its acts of charity and moral integrity, which often stood in stark contrast to the surrounding culture. This behavior serves as a testimony to the transformative power of the Gospel and can lead others to glorify God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

Still, it is not so. Other Hebrews, he reminds them in this word, were safe from persecution only by rejecting the national hope of a Messiah. It is simply because these men are "in Christ" that the heathens (perhaps also their fellow Jews) insult their conversation.

Calvin (quoted by Huther) says, "Quid parum auctoritatis habet sermo absque vita." <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers.</span> The Revised Version follows the Sinaitic Manuscript in reading, "Wherein ye are spoken against," and omitting "as of evil-doers? It is possible that the received reading may have been interpolated from <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, where the same words occur; except that there the mood is indicative, here, conjunctive, "wherein they may possibly speak evil of you." <span class="cmt_word">They may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ</span>; rather, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they may be put to shame</span>; that is, "proved to be liars" (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/7-14.htm">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>). The word translated "falsely accuse" is that which is rendered "despitefully use" in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. <a href="/luke/6-28.htm">Luke 6:28</a>. It is a strong word. Aristotle defines the corresponding substantive as a thwarting of the wishes of others out of gratuitous malice ('Rhet.,' 2:2). For "good conversation," see <a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 18</a>. The Christian's life is in Christ, in the sphere of his presence, he dwelling in us, and we in him (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">keeping</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(echontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
