In biblical context, Jesus is often referred to as the "stone" or "rock," symbolizing strength, stability, and foundation. For believers, Jesus is the cornerstone of their faith, the essential element upon which their spiritual lives are built. This aligns with passages such as <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, where Christ is described as the cornerstone of the church. The preciousness of this stone to believers highlights the personal relationship and the salvation they find in Him. Historically, the imagery of a cornerstone would resonate with the audience familiar with construction practices, where the cornerstone is the first stone set in the foundation, determining the position of the entire structure.<p><b>But to those who do not believe,</b><br>This phrase introduces a contrast between believers and non-believers. In the cultural and historical context of the early church, there was a clear division between those who accepted Jesus as the Messiah and those who rejected Him. This division often led to persecution and social ostracism for early Christians. The distinction here underscores the differing perceptions of Jesus' role and significance, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament.<p><b>&#8220;The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,&#8221;</b><br>This part of the verse is a direct quotation from <a href="/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, a messianic prophecy that is frequently referenced in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>). The "builders" symbolize the religious leaders and authorities of the time who rejected Jesus, failing to recognize His messianic role. Despite this rejection, Jesus becomes the cornerstone, the most crucial part of God's redemptive plan. This transformation from rejection to foundational importance is a powerful testament to God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of prophecy. The use of this imagery would have been particularly poignant for Peter's audience, who were familiar with the Jewish scriptures and the significance of the cornerstone in construction. It serves as a reminder of the unexpected ways in which God accomplishes His purposes, turning what was dismissed by men into the central element of His divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter, addressing early Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Those who have faith in Jesus Christ and recognize Him as the cornerstone of their faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/unbelievers.htm">Unbelievers</a></b><br>Those who reject Jesus, failing to see His significance and value.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stone.htm">The Stone</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, the cornerstone of the Christian faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/builders.htm">Builders</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the Jewish leaders and others who rejected Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_faith.htm">The Value of Faith</a></b><br>For believers, Jesus is precious.

Both the Hebrew and the Greek word rendered "precious" may with equal propriety be translated "honoured," and this contrasts better with the "shame" just spoken of. Thus Dr. Lightfoot takes it. The argument is this: "God has selected Jesus for special honour, and has promised that all who trust in Him, instead of scorning Him like the Jewish rulers, shall have no cause to blush. Now <span class= "ital">you do</span> trust in Him, therefore to you belongs the promise, and the honour bestowed by God on Him reflects on you. You, like Him, are made parts of the divine imperishable architecture."<p><span class= "bld">Unto them which be disobedient.</span>--The better reading is, <span class= "ital">Unto them which disbelieve;</span> the other word being an importation from <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>. The true reading better preserves the contrast with "you that believe."<p><span class= "bld">The stone which the builders disallowed.</span>--We should perhaps have rather expected the sentence to run more like this: "To you which believe belongs the honour, but to those who disbelieve belongs the shame from which you are secured." But instead, the Apostle stops short, and inserts (by a quotation) the historical fact which <span class= "ital">brought</span> the shame, viz., the disappointment of their own design, and the glorious completion of that which they opposed. The words which follow are quoted directly from the LXX., and properly represent the Hebrew. Almost all the best modern critics consider the Psalm from which this verse is cited to be a late Psalm, written subsequent to the return from Babylon, in which case it is most probable that the composer was directly thinking of the prophecy of Isaiah above quoted. The Messianic interpretation of the Psalm would be no novelty to the Hebrews who received this Epistle (see <a href="/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>), though probably they had not perceived it in its fulness. In its first application the passage seems to mean as follows: The speaker is Israel, taken as a single person. He has been a despised captive. The great builders of the world--the Babylonian and Persian empires--had recognised no greatness in him, and had no intention of advancing him; they were engaged in aggrandisement of self alone. Yet, after all, Israel is firmly planted once more in Sion, to be the first stone of a new structure, a new empire. Thus this interpretation at once suggests the admission of the Gentiles, humanity at large, into the architecture. Israel is the corner-stone, but corner-stones are not laid to be left unbuilt upon. In the fulfilment Christ takes the place of Israel, as is the case with Isaiah 53. The builders are the rulers of the Jews. In <a href="/acts/4-11.htm" title="This is the stone which was set at nothing of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.">Acts 4:11</a> our author had called the Sanhedrin to their face, "you builders." They, like the kings of Babylon, had been intent on building a fabric of their own, and had despised Jesus, yet, without any intention of so doing, had been the means of advancing Him (<a href="/context/acts/4-27.htm" title="For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,">Acts 4:27-28</a>). He had been made the basis of a new spiritual structure, in which faith, not fleshly lineage, was the cement and bond; and the believing Israelites, united to Him in both ways, shared the honour of being corner-stone. A further point is given to the quotation if we suppose, with Hengstenberg, Delitzsch, and others, that the remembrance of Isaiah's prophecy of the "corner-stone" was suggested to the original Psalmist by the works of the Second Temple, then begun, advancing, or fresh completed. It will then fit in more perfectly with the description of the "spiritual house." Leighton well points out how sore a trial it was to the faith of Jewish Christians to see that their own chosen people, even the most learned of them, rejected Christ, and adds, "That they may know this makes nothing against Him, nor ought to invalidate their faith at all, but rather testifies with Christ, and so serves to confirm them in believing, the Apostle makes use of those prophetical scriptures that foretell the unbelief and contempt with which the most would entertain Christ."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto you therefore which believe is the honor</span>. The apostle applies the last clause of the prophecy to his readers: they believe, they are built up by faith upon the chief Cornerstone; therefore the honor implied in the words of the prophet, "He that believeth on him shall not be confounded" is theirs. There may also be in the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, honor, an echo of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("precious," literally, "held in honor") of ver. 6; and thus the further meaning may be implied, "The worth which the stone has it has for you who believe" (Wiesinger, quoted by Huther). But the first explanation is nearer to the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the Head of the corner</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">for such as disbelieve</span>. St. Peter repeats the words of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, quoted by our Lord in <a href="/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, and by himself in <a href="/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>. The builders, the priests and teachers of the Jewish Church, rejected the living Stone; but it became, and indeed through that rejection, the Head of the corner. "He became obedient unto death ... therefore God also highly exalted him." If this psalm is post-Exilic, as most modern critics think, the cornerstone, in its first application, may be Israel regarded as a whole. The great builders, the rulers of Assyria, Babylon, Persia, had despised that stone; but it was chosen of God, and now it was set in Zion. It is possible, as Hengstenberg and Delitzsch suggest, that the building of the second temple may have recalled to the mind of the psalmist Isaiah's prophecy of the chief Corner-stone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/2-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
