This phrase highlights their diligent search and inquiry into God's plan. The Hebrew prophets, such as Isaiah and Daniel, often received visions and messages that were not immediately clear, prompting them to seek further understanding. This reflects the human desire to comprehend divine mysteries and the limitations of human understanding without the full revelation of God's timing.<p><b>to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing</b><br>The "Spirit of Christ" refers to the Holy Spirit, who inspired the prophets. This indicates that the message of the Messiah was consistent throughout Scripture, as the same Spirit that was in Christ was also at work in the prophets. This continuity underscores the unity of the Old and New Testaments and the divine inspiration behind the prophetic messages. The Spirit's role in guiding the prophets emphasizes the divine origin of their messages and the centrality of Christ in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>when He predicted the sufferings of Christ</b><br>The sufferings of Christ were foretold in various Old Testament passages, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the suffering servant, and <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, which vividly portrays the Messiah's anguish. These prophecies were fulfilled in the life and crucifixion of Jesus, who endured suffering for the salvation of humanity. The prediction of Christ's sufferings highlights the sacrificial nature of His mission and the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption through His atoning death.<p><b>and the glories to follow</b><br>Following His sufferings, Christ's resurrection and ascension into glory were also prophesied. Passages like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a> speak of the Messiah's triumph and eternal reign. The "glories" include His victory over death, His exaltation at the right hand of the Father, and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.

They knew that they spoke "concerning a salvation," but they did not know the <span class= "ital">details.</span> The present passage is perhaps the most striking in the whole New Testament in regard to the doctrine of prophetic inspiration. Assuming that the prophets did not speak simply of their own human calculation, but somehow under the influence of the Divine Spirit, we are brought to face the question, <span class= "ital">how far</span> their utterances were their own, and how far suggested to them from on high. The doctrine of Montanism, which has not altogether died out of the Church yet, asserts that from first to last prophecy is superhuman; that every word and letter is forced upon the man by a power not his own, which leaves him no choice. God, and God alone, is responsible for every syllable. The human will and intelligence need not even concur in the message they deliver, nor even be conscious that they are delivering it. Thus Montanus makes God to say through him: "Lo, man is as a lyre, and I am as that which strikes the chords: the man is unconscious, and I alone wake." On the other hand, some of the early opponents of Montanism went so far as to say that the inspired writers had a clear and immediate perception, a complete insight into the mysteries which they foretold,--that Isaiah, for instance, saw, as plainly as we do, Mary and Jesus in his prophecy of Immanuel. Our present verses show a doctrine between the two. The prophets find themselves impelled to say words which they are conscious of choosing and using, but which they feel to have a deeper meaning than they themselves were conscious of intending. It is clear to them (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>) that what they meant primarily as applying to present circumstances, was in reality being overruled by the Spirit to apply more fully to the future. But what that future was they struggled, and half in vain, to know. We may apply to them what Keble says of the Greek poets:--<p>"As little children lisp, and tell of Heaven,<p>So thoughts beyond their thoughts to those high bards were given."<p><span class= "bld">What, or what manner of time.</span>--If this be right, it must mean, "what exact or approximate date." But the simplest translation would be, <span class= "ital">to whom, or what period, the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing.</span> This would give new significance to the sentence. They were aware that they were speaking of a <span class= "ital">Messiah</span>; but who the man should be who would hold that office, or at what period of their history he would arise, this was what they longed to know. They foresaw a Christ, but they could not foresee Jesus; they could give to their Christ no definite position in future history. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/22-42.htm" title="Saying, What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David.">Matthew 22:42</a>; <a href="/luke/3-15.htm" title="And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;">Luke 3:15</a>; <a href="/luke/23-35.htm" title="And the people stood beholding.

The Authorized Version neglects the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle says that the Spirit of Christ dwelt in the prophets. The words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> cannot mean "the Spirit which bears witness of Christ," as Bengel and others. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ (see <a href="/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). He is not only sent from the Father by the Son, but he proceedeth from the Father and the Son. This important statement involves also the pre-existence and the Divinity of Christ (comp. <a href="/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56, 58</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>, in the best-supported reading). The prophets felt within them the working of the Spirit. They knew that the mysterious voice which filled their souls was his voice. Its utterances were not always clear; they were sometimes obscure and mystical, but the heart of the prophets was stirred to the utmost; they sought with earnest prayer and devout thought into the purposes of God announced in the revelation. Especially they asked, as the apostles asked the Lord on the Mount of Olives, "When shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming?" At what time would the Messiah be revealed? What would be the distinctive character, the marks, the signs, of that time? "Prophetae ab ipso habentes donum in ilium prophetarunt" ('Ep. Barnab.,' 100. 5). When it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow; rather, <span class="accented">the sufferings for Christ</span> (destined for Christ), <span class="accented">and the glories after these</span>. Compare St. Peter's speech (<a href="/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>), "Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled." So St. Paul, in his speech before King Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22, 23</a>), asserts that he had said "none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead." The doctrine of a suffering Messiah was a stumbling-block to the Jews. The apostles could not understand it till after the Savior's resurrection; Peter himself had recoiled from it with horror, and had been rebuked by the Lord (<a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22, 23</a>); now, taught by the Spirit, he understands the foreshadowings of the sufferings of Christ, which the Spirit of Christ had testified to the prophets. The Lord himself had expounded, on the day of his resurrection, the things concerning himself, beginning at Moses and all the prophets: "Ought not Christ," he said, "to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" (<a href="/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>). Some think that St. Peter is referring mainly to the prophets of the New Testament, and that the words, "the sufferings of Christ," are to be understood mystically of Christ suffering in his Church, as "the afflictions of Christ" in <a href="/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. But the context does not require this explanation, and the parallel passages quoted above seem to preclude it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">trying to determine</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#961;&#945;&#965;&#957;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eraun&#333;ntes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2045.htm">Strong's 2045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search diligently, examine.
