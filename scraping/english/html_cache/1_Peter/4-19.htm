The early Christians faced persecution, and Peter's letter addresses their trials, encouraging them to see their suffering as aligned with God's purposes. This echoes the experiences of Job, who suffered greatly yet remained faithful, and Jesus, who suffered according to God's will for the redemption of humanity. The concept of suffering for righteousness is also found in <a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>, where Jesus speaks of the blessedness of those persecuted for righteousness' sake.<p><b>should entrust their souls</b><br>The act of entrusting one's soul implies a deep level of faith and reliance on God. This is reminiscent of Jesus' words on the cross, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit" (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). The idea is to place one's life and future in God's hands, trusting in His ultimate plan and goodness. This trust is a recurring theme in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>, where David expresses his trust in God amidst adversity.<p><b>to their faithful Creator</b><br>Referring to God as the "faithful Creator" emphasizes His reliability and the intimate relationship between the Creator and His creation. This title reminds believers of God's sovereignty and His ongoing care for the world He made. The faithfulness of God is a central theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>, which speaks of His mercies being new every morning. The creation narrative in Genesis establishes God as the Creator, and His faithfulness is demonstrated throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>and continue to do good</b><br>Despite suffering, believers are called to persist in doing good. This reflects the teachings of Jesus, who instructed His followers to love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). The call to do good is a hallmark of Christian ethics, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which encourages believers not to grow weary in doing good. This perseverance in righteousness serves as a testimony to others and aligns with the example set by Christ, who went about doing good despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

And the clause, "according to the will of God," seems not intended to mean "in a godly and unblameable manner," as opposed to the "suffering as a murderer" (<a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>); rather, it brings out that such a death is no accident, no sudden calamity, but in strict accordance with God's prearranged design. (Comp. <a href="/1_peter/3-17.htm" title="For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.">1Peter 3:17</a> : "if the will of God will it.") Thus it harmonises with the following: "faithful Creator," "commit their souls."<p><span class= "bld">Commit the keeping of their souls</span>.--The beautiful verb rendered "commit the keeping of" is a technical term for <span class= "ital">depositing</span> a deed, or sum of money, or other valuable, with any one in trust. In the literal sense it occurs in <a href="/luke/12-48.htm" title="But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For to whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.">Luke 12:48</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12</a> : in a metaphorical sense, of <span class= "ital">doctrines</span> committed in trust to the safe keeping of the Episcopate, in <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2Timothy 1:14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm" title="And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.">2Timothy 2:2</a> : of leaving <span class= "ital">persons</span> whom you love in trust, in <a href="/acts/14-23.htm" title="And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="/acts/20-32.htm" title="And now, brothers, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.">Acts 20:32</a>. But the words which St. Peter probably has ringing in his ears when he thus writes are the words of our Lord on the cross (where the same verb is used): "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit" (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>).

Even if the worst should come to the worst, and you must die a martyr's death, it is but the execution of God's plan for you. View your life as a deposit: lay it confidently in His hands, to be returned to you again when the time comes: and you will find Him faithful to what a Creator ought to be." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let them also that suffer.</span> St. Peter sums up his exhortation; he returns to the thought of <a href="/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>, "It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing." In the hour of suffering, as well as in times of prosperity, we are in the hands of a merciful and loving Father; we are to learn submission, not because the suffering is inevitable, but because it is according to his will, and his will is our sanctification and salvation.

The word rendered "Creator" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) Occurs nowhere else in the Greek Testament. <span class="cmt_word">God is our Creator, the Father of spirits, He gave the spirit; to him it returneth</span>. We must imitate our dying Lord, and, like him, commit our souls to the keeping of our heavenly Father as a deposit which may be left with perfect confidence in the hands of a faithful Creator (see <a href="/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>). There is an evident reference here to our Lord's words upon the cross (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>). St. Peter adds, "in well-doing." The Christian's faith must bring forth the fruits of holy living; even in the midst of suffering he must "be careful to maintain good works." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/4-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8045;&#963;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#333;ste)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5620.htm">Strong's 5620: </a> </span><span class="str2">So that, therefore, so then, so as to.
