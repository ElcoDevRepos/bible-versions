Just as the floodwaters were a means of salvation for Noah and his family, baptism is a symbol of salvation for believers. The floodwaters cleansed the earth of sin, paralleling how baptism represents the cleansing of sin. Baptism is not merely a ritual but signifies a deeper spiritual reality. It is an outward expression of an inward faith, aligning with the practice of the early church as seen in <a href="/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, where Peter calls for repentance and baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins.<p><b>not the removal of dirt from the body</b><br>This phrase clarifies that baptism is not about physical cleanliness. In the cultural context of the time, ritual washings were common in various religious practices, including Judaism, where ceremonial washings were part of purification rites. However, Peter emphasizes that Christian baptism transcends these rituals. It is not about external purification but an internal transformation. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, where He states that what comes out of the mouth defiles a person, not what goes into it, highlighting the importance of inner purity over external rituals.<p><b>but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God</b><br>Baptism is described as a "pledge" or "appeal" to God for a clear conscience. This indicates a personal commitment and response to God's grace. It involves a conscious decision to turn away from sin and live a life pleasing to God. The concept of a clear conscience is significant in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>, which speaks of the blood of Christ cleansing our conscience from dead works to serve the living God. This pledge is a declaration of faith and a commitment to a new way of life in Christ.<p><b>through the resurrection of Jesus Christ</b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of Christian faith and the basis for the efficacy of baptism. It is through His resurrection that believers are given new life and hope. <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a> explains that just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too may live a new life. The resurrection signifies victory over sin and death, providing the power for believers to live transformed lives. It fulfills Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>, which foretold that God's Holy One would not see decay, affirming Jesus as the Messiah and the source of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers in Asia Minor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>Mentioned in the preceding verses, his account is used as an analogy for salvation through water.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central to the passage, His resurrection is the means by which baptism saves.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baptism.htm">Baptism</a></b><br>A Christian sacrament symbolizing purification and admission to the faith, discussed here as a pledge of a good conscience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flood.htm">The Flood</a></b><br>The event in Noah's time, symbolizing judgment and salvation through water.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_baptism.htm">Symbolism of Baptism</a></b><br>Baptism is not merely a physical act of washing but a spiritual pledge of a good conscience toward God.<br><br>It represents an inward transformation and commitment to follow Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_through_resurrection.htm">Salvation through Resurrection</a></b><br>The power of baptism lies in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which assures believers of their new life.<br><br>Our hope and salvation are anchored in Christ's victory over death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/conscience_and_commitment.htm">Conscience and Commitment</a></b><br>Baptism is a public declaration of faith and a commitment to live with a clear conscience before God.<br><br>It calls believers to a life of integrity and obedience to God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/connection_to_old_testament.htm">Connection to Old Testament</a></b><br>Just as Noah was saved through water, baptism symbolizes our salvation and deliverance from sin.<br><br>It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_faith.htm">Practical Faith</a></b><br>Baptism is an outward expression of an inward faith, encouraging believers to live out their faith in daily life.<br><br>It challenges us to continually seek a deeper relationship with God and align our actions with His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Peter_3_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Peter 3:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_3_21_Baptism_s_role_in_salvation.htm">How does 1 Peter 3:21 define the role of baptism in salvation?

Those who trust the risen Lord step into the water as living witnesses that judgment has passed, new life has begun, and Jesus saves completely.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us.</span>--There are two undoubted false readings in this sentence which must be cleared away before we can consider the meaning. First, the word "whereunto" is a mistake for the more difficult <span class= "ital">which;</span> and second, it should be <span class= "ital">you, </span>not "us." We may then translate, either, <span class= "ital">Which baptism also, in antitype, doth now save you, </span>or else, <span class= "ital">Which</span> (w<span class= "ital">ater</span>)<span class= "ital"> also, in antitype, now saveth you</span>--<span class= "ital">baptism.</span> The first is less likely, both from the order of the words in Greek, and also because of the difficulty of calling the Flood point-blank a baptism. According to the second translation, the water <span class= "ital">through</span> which Noah was saved is said in the present day ("now," as opposed to "in the days of Noe") to save <span class= "ital">us</span> (the "you" is emphatic). It does so, in the same sense as we might say, for instance, that the sprinkling of the paschal blood saves us: that is to say, it foreshadowed something which does as a fact save us. This St. Peter expresses by the adjective which may be rendered "in antitype." The thing it represented is Christian baptism. Where, then, lies the likeness between the two? Not merely in the identity of the element water, which serves but to arrest the fancy, and make one think of the deeper resemblance. One obvious point is that the number of persons accepting the proffered salvation at the present crisis is, as in the days of Noe, very small compared with those who reject it. The main thought, however, is not of the Christians, as a body or family (like Noe's), being saved while others are lost. For each individual by himself there is a meaning in his baptism which is prefigured by the Flood; and the explanation of baptism which follows, and the opening of the next chapter, show that the Apostle was thinking chiefly of this individual application. As the passage of Israel through the Red Sea is described as a baptism (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-2.htm" title="And were all baptized to Moses in the cloud and in the sea;">1Corinthians 10:2</a>) because it marked their transition from the state of bondage to a new national life, and left their enemies destroyed in the water, so Noe's safe passage through the Flood is a type of baptism, because it was a regeneration of humanity, it was a destruction of the carnal, sensual element (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>. "he also is <span class= "ital">flesh</span>")<span class= "ital">, </span>it washed the human race from its pollutions, and man rose to a new and more spiritual existence for the time being, with the bow for a sign of a perpetual covenant made. So baptism is a destruction and death to the flesh, but a new life to the spirit. It must be observed how carefully St. Peter expresses the <span class= "ital">permanent</span> effect of baptism by the present tense "saveth:" not "saved you," nor "hath saved you;" it is a living and ever present fact, the "<span class= "ital">everlasting</span> benediction of His heavenly washing;" it washes the neophyte not from past sins only, but from those which he afterwards commits, if only he still repents and believes.<p><span class= "bld">Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh.</span>--The Apostle is not cautioning his readers against the thought that baptism acted <span class= "ital">ex opere operato, </span>as a charm, but he is telling them, on the contrary, that it is no external rite. He was writing to Jews, who were very familiar with ceremonial washings, or "baptisings," which, though <span class= "ital">they symbolised</span> a cleansing from sin, really <span class= "ital">effected</span> nothing but to make the skin less dirty.<p><span class= "bld">But the answer of a good conscience toward God.</span>--An expression which has caused almost as much difficulty as any in the New Testament. The difficulty lay especially in two points: first, that the context was so involved as to give little indication what to <span class= "ital">expect;</span> secondly, that the Greek word (<span class= "ital">eperotema</span>) which is here rendered "answer" is so seldom found. and might easily take such various shades of meaning. (1) Touching the word itself, we may at once reject the translation "answer," for it could only mean an "answer" in that sense in which "question" and "answer" are identical, both of them being "the thing asked," the subject matter of both being the same; but so cumbersome a sense is not in keeping here. (2) Next we may consider the attractive theory that it means a "contract." The form in which a contract was made was as follows: N says to M, "Dost thou promise?" and M answers, "I promise." Now in Byzantine Law-Greek such a contract is known as an <span class= "ital">eperotema, </span>or "questionment," from the question with which proceedings began. And, as a matter of fact, the baptismal covenant has undoubtedly been entered upon from the earliest times with just such questions and answers. Tertullian speaks of this (<span class= "ital">De Corona, </span>chap. iii.) as an ancient custom in the end of the second century. There are, however, three serious objections: first, that "the contract of a good conscience" is a somewhat vague and imperfect phrase, and far more difficult in Greek than in English; secondly, that there is no trace of the legal term <span class= "ital">eperotema</span> until centuries after the date of St. Peter, or of Tertullian either; thirdly, that had <span class= "ital">eperotema</span> been a recognised term for a "contract" in St. Peter's time, we should have been certain to find this explanation in some of the Greek Fathers. (3) The usual meaning of the verb would lead us towards a less unsatisfactory conclusion. <span class= "ital">Eperotan</span> is "to put a question" for further information's sake. And we may remark that the order of the Greek would strongly suggest that the words "toward God" should be attached (in spite of the analogy of <a href="/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>) not to "good conscience," but to the word <span class= "ital">eperotema.</span> Now, there is a constant use of the verb <span class= "ital">eperotan</span> in the Old Testament in connection with the name of God. In <a href="/joshua/9-14.htm" title="And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD.">Joshua 9:14</a>, <a href="/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Judges 1:1</a>; <a href="/judges/18-5.htm" title="And they said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.">Judges 18:5</a>, and many other places, it means "to consult God," "to inquire of the Lord," to seek to Him for direction. Or, with a slightly different turn, it is used, as in <a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm" title="And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.">Isaiah 19:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a>, for "to inquire after God," in which sense it finds its way into the New Testament in <a href="/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.">Romans 10:20</a>. Thus baptism would be said to be, "not the flesh's putting away of dirt (for so it might be turned, though it is somewhat forced), but a good conscience's inquiry at the hands of God," or "a good conscience's inquiry after God." Observe that if the "good conscience" is the agent in this transaction, as here expressed, St. Peter would recognise (as in <a href="/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>) the man's happy state of soul <span class= "ital">before</span> baptism, and baptism would be the mode of his further approach to God. That this is good doctrine cannot be denied. (4) There is, however, another version for which a still better case can be made out: viz., "demand." It is true that the verb <span class= "ital">eperotan</span> more frequently means "to ask" a question than "to ask" a boon, expecting a verbal response rather than a practical one; but it is once used in the New Testament in the latter sense (<a href="/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a>), and in the Old Testament also (as <a href="/psalms/137-3.htm" title="For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.">Psalm 137:3</a>). And the only other instance of the word <span class= "ital">eperotema</span> in inspired literature makes for this view. This occurs in <a href="/daniel/4-17.htm" title="This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.">Daniel 4:17</a>, where the English has "demand," and the Latin <span class= "ital">petitio.</span> There is, indeed, almost as much difficulty in ascertaining the exact sense there as here; but, on the whole, it seems to mean the "demand" for Nebuchadnezzar's degradation. This was evidently the meaning assigned to our present passage by the anonymous Father in the Catena, for, wrongly joining the words "through the resurrection" with <span class= "ital">eperotema, </span>he says: "It teacheth also how we <span class= "ital">beseech</span> of Him; and how? by confessing the resurrection of the Lord." Taking, then, the rendering "demand," a further question arises: Does St. Peter mean that baptism is the demand (made by God or the Church upon the man) <span class= "ital">for</span> a good conscience towards God? or the demand <span class= "ital">made by</span> a good conscience upon God, without specifying the demand? or finally, the demand upon God (made by the man) <span class= "ital">for</span> a good conscience? Of these the second seems the weakest, because it leaves the nature of the demand so open, and because the notion of a good conscience <span class= "ital">previous</span> to baptism is less suited to the context. The first would indeed give a vigorous sense. St. Peter would then be saying, "Have a good conscience (<a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1Peter 3:16</a>), for, besides all else, it is your baptismal obligation, and in defiling conscience you forfeit your baptismal salvation;" but it labours under the defect of connecting "toward God" with "conscience" instead of with "demand," and it is imperfect, moreover, in not demanding a good conscience toward men as well as toward God. The last seems both the clearest in itself, the best antithesis to the balancing clause, and the most in keeping with the context. It will then be: "Noah's flood, in antitype, to this day saves you--that is to say, baptism, which is no cleansing of the skin from dirt, but an application to God for a clear conscience." A "good conscience," in this case, will not mean an honest frame of mind, but a consciousness of having nothing against you, such as would come to even the chief of sinners from the baptismal remission of sins. "Conscience" is used in this retrospective sense four times in Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/10-2.htm" title="For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>); and, indeed, in <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1Peter 3:16</a> it meant "having nothing on your mind because of the past," rather than "being sure that you <span class= "ital">mean</span> well." And how well this suits the context! The Apostle, from <a href="/1_peter/3-13.htm" title="And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?">1Peter 3:13</a> to <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>, is uttering the praises of a clear conscience, and warning from everything that could defile it. "With this," he says, "you cannot be harmed; with this, you will be always ready to defend the faith when called to account. It was because He had this that Christ was able to atone for you and bring you to God, and to conduct His mission to the dead, and to give by His resurrection an efficacy to your baptism; and that baptism itself only saves you by the fact that in it you ask and receive the cleansing of the conscience." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us.</span> The reading of the Textus Receptus <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>, represented by "whereunto," is without authority; all the uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;</span>, "which," in the nominative case. The oldest manuscripts also read "you" instead of "us." The antecedent of the relative must be the word immediately preceding, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, water; the word "baptism" is added in apposition, to define more clearly the apostle's meaning; the water which saves is the water of baptism. Thus the literal translation will be, "Which (as) antitype is saving you also, (namely) baptism;" that is, the water which is saving you is the antitype of the water of the Flood. That water was made the means of saving a few; it bore up the ark in which they were. It saved them, perhaps, from the malice of the ungodly; it saved them from that corruption which was almost universal; it was the means of saving the race of men as by a new birth through death into a new life, a new beginning; it washed away the evil, those who suffered for evil-doing, and so saved those who had doubtless been suffering for well-doing. Thus it is the figure (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of the antitype (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baptism; the two (the water of the Flood and the water of baptism) correspond as type and antitype. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the counterpart of the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> sometimes means the original, sometimes the figure, there is a correspondent variation in the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Delitzsch says, on <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>, "We have found <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> at 1 Peter 8:5 used in the sense of an original figure - a model from which a copy is made; such copy from an original (or architype) is that designated as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> here. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> again (as at <a href="/romans/5-14.htm">Romans 5:14</a>) is used in the sense of a prophetic foretype, of which the accomplishment is reserved for the future (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); and that accomplishment is again called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (antitype); <span class="accented">e.g.</span> baptism, at <a href="/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>, is in this sense an <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Deluge. The earthly reflection of the heavenly archetype, and the actual fulfillment of the prophetic <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, are each called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>." Here the water of the Flood is the prophetic foretype; baptism is the accomplishment. "Baptism," St. Peter says, "is saving you," the few Christians, separating you from the vast number of Gentiles, whom in some sense it condemns through their rejection of God's offered mercy (comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), saving you from the corruption of their evil example, bringing you into the ark of Christ's Church, bearing up that ark through the grace of the new birth. The apostle says, "Baptism is saving you;" he does not say, "hits saved;" he is using the present tense in its proper sense of an incomplete action; it brings us into a state of salvation, into covenant with God. But it is only the beginning, the birth; the growth must follow; the death unto sin, the new birth unto righteousness, must be realized in actual life; otherwise, alas! we shall have received the grace of God in vain (comp. <a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). (<span class="cmt_word">Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God.)</span> St. Peter hastens to explain his statement. Baptism doth save us, but not the mere outward ceremony; you may "make clean the outside" with the most scrupulous care; you may be very careful in putting away the filth of the flesh (or, if the genitive is to be regarded as subjective, with Bengel, the flesh may put away its filth); but more is needed than the old Jewish washings, the frequent purifications.

Observe that St. Peter uses the word here rendered "putting away" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) again in the Second Epistle (1. 14) of putting off the earthly tabernacle (comp. also <a href="/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, where he uses the corresponding participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The next clause presents great difficulty. Is the genitive subjective or objective? What is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>? The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in one other place in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> [in the Authorized Version, 4:17D, where it is translated "demand;" the corresponding verb is of frequent occurrence; as in <a href="/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>, "them that asked not after me;" and <a href="/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> (<a href="/2_samuel/11-7.htm">2 Samuel 11:7</a>, in the Authorized Version), where it is joined with the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, as in this verse. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> seems to mean an "inquiry," and the genitive is probably subjective. The inner meaning of baptism is not that the flesh puts away its filth, but that a good conscience inquires after God. The outward and visible sign doth not save if separated from the inward and spiritual grace. The first is necessary, for it is an outward sign appointed by Christ; but it will not save without the second; those who draw near to God must have their bodies washed with pure water, but also their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience (<a href="/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>). The inner cleansing of the soul results in a good conscience, a consciousness of sincerity, of good intentions and desires, which will instinctively seek after God. And that good conscience is the effect of baptism, when baptism has its perfect work, when those who have once been grafted into the true Vine abide in Christ, when those who have once been baptized in one Spirit into one body keep the unity of the Spirit, Christ dwelling in them, and they in Christ. Archbishop Leighton explains the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> as "the whole correspondence of the conscience with God, and with itself as towards God, or in the sight of God." If the genitive is regarded as objective, the meaning will be, "an inquiry addressed to God for a good conscience;" the soul, once awakened, seeks continually fuller purification, hungers and thirsts after righteousness. This gives a good sense, but seems less suitable in this context. It is possible also to join the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of a good conscience in relation to God; but it seems much more natural to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Some commentators follow AEcumenius in paraphrasing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; they take the ground that, in legal language, the word was used in the sense of a contract, and they see in St. Peter's words a reference to the covenant made with God in baptism, and to the questions and answers in which, from the earliest times, that covenant was expressed; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being used in a general sense so as to cover answers as well as questions.
