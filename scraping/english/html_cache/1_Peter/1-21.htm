In the context of 1 Peter, the audience is primarily Gentile Christians who have come to faith through the message of the Gospel. Jesus is the bridge between humanity and God, fulfilling the role of the High Priest as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>. This reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, where the suffering servant brings people to God. The phrase underscores the necessity of Christ for salvation, aligning with <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, where Jesus states that no one comes to the Father except through Him.<p><b>who raised Him from the dead</b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian faith, serving as the validation of Jesus' divine nature and the truth of His teachings. This event is a cornerstone of apostolic preaching, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14-17</a>. The resurrection signifies victory over sin and death, fulfilling prophecies like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-11</a>. Historically, the empty tomb and post-resurrection appearances provide evidence for this miraculous event, which transformed the disciples from fearful followers into bold proclaimers of the Gospel.<p><b>and glorified Him</b><br>The glorification of Jesus refers to His exaltation and ascension to the right hand of God, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a> and <a href="/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>. This glorification is a fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and sovereign power. It signifies Jesus' divine authority and His role as the eternal King. The cultural context of honor and shame in the ancient world highlights the significance of Jesus' glorification, as it reverses the shame of the crucifixion and affirms His divine status.<p><b>and so your faith and hope are in God</b><br>This phrase connects the believer's faith and hope directly to God, emphasizing the trustworthiness and faithfulness of God as the object of Christian hope. Faith and hope are central themes in the New Testament, often linked together as in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> and <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1-5</a>. The assurance of God's promises, demonstrated through the resurrection and glorification of Jesus, provides believers with a steadfast hope. This hope is not merely wishful thinking but a confident expectation based on God's proven character and the fulfillment of His promises throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle, writing to encourage and instruct believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of Christianity, whose resurrection and glorification are pivotal to the faith and hope of believers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who raised Jesus from the dead and glorified Him, the object of Christian faith and hope.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was raised from the dead, affirming His divinity and the truth of His teachings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glorification_of_jesus.htm">The Glorification of Jesus</a></b><br>The event where Jesus was exalted and honored by God, confirming His authority and role as Savior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_rooted_in_resurrection.htm">Faith Rooted in Resurrection</a></b><br>Our faith is not blind but is grounded in the historical event of Jesus' resurrection, which validates His claims and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_anchored_in_glorification.htm">Hope Anchored in Glorification</a></b><br>The glorification of Jesus assures us of our future hope, as His exaltation is a foretaste of the glory believers will share.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_christ_in_belief.htm">The Centrality of Christ in Belief</a></b><br>Belief in God is mediated through Jesus Christ; He is the way to the Father, and our relationship with God is established through Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_light_of_resurrection_power.htm">Living in Light of Resurrection Power</a></b><br>The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is at work in believers, empowering us to live victoriously and with purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_hope_as_pillars_of_christian_life.htm">Faith and Hope as Pillars of Christian Life</a></b><br>Faith and hope are foundational to the Christian experience, shaping our worldview and guiding our actions and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Peter_1_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Peter 1:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_1_21_Trust_God_via_Jesus.htm">How does 1 Peter 1:21 encourage trust in God through Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_reveal_God_s_power_in_1_Peter.htm">What role does faith play in experiencing God's power, according to 1 Peter 1:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Peter_1_21_to_1_Cor_15_resurrection.htm">How does 1 Peter 1:21 connect to the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_daily_strengthen_your_faith_in_God.htm">In what ways can you strengthen your faith in God daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_in_God_guide_you_today.htm">How does hope in God influence your actions and decisions today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_1_21_Resurrection_s_faith_role.htm">How does 1 Peter 1:21 affirm the resurrection's role in Christian faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_1_21_on_God-Jesus_relationship.htm">What does 1 Peter 1:21 reveal about the relationship between God and Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Peter_1_21_s_impact_on_modern_faith.htm">How does 1 Peter 1:21 challenge the concept of faith in modern Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_peter_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Peter 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_makes_saints_incorruptible.htm">What defines the incorruptibility of saints?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_age_will_we_be_in_heaven.htm">What age will we be in Heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_was_christ_chosen_pre-creation.htm">How can 1 Peter 1:20 claim Christ was chosen &#8220;before the creation of the world&#8221; when historical evidence places Jesus&#8217;s life in the first century?

The "who" might be rendered by "and you;" and the clause adds a kind of proof of the foregoing statement, drawn from the result of God's manifestation of Christ to them. "This Christian doctrine is no innovation, nothing to lead you away from the God of our fathers. That same God had had the scheme in His thoughts from the beginning, and it is in that same God that you have been led thereby to believe." There is a better supported and more forcible reading, <span class= "ital">Who through Him are faithful towards God, </span>which combines the ideas of believing, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>putting the whole trust in God, and of loyal inward observance of Him. And if any one asks whether it be possible to say that Hebrew men only came to believe in God through the revelation of Christ, we must answer by pointing to the whole scope of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and especially to <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>, where it is not faith in Christ, but faith in a living God, which they are warned not to abandon: and to <a href="/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>, where faith toward God is part of the "word of the beginning of <span class= "ital">Christ.</span>"<p><span class= "bld">That raised him up.</span>--These clauses give the historical facts which had led them, "through Christ," to a living faith in God. Though the thought is common with St. Paul (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/context/romans/1-2.htm" title="(Which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)">Romans 1:2-4</a>), St. Peter was familiar with it years before St. Paul's conversion. See this in <a href="/context/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23-24</a>; and <a href="/context/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33-36</a> of the same chapter will show what he means by "gave Him glory"--not to be confined to the Ascension, though that is the prominent thought; the glory was already partly given in the Resurrection. Comp. <a href="/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a>, where there is the same reciprocal glorification of the Father and the Son, as here. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who by him do believe in God</span>; or, according to two of the most ancient manuscripts, <span class="accented">who through him are faithful towards God</span>. Through himself, not only through his incarnation and atoning death, but through his grace and abiding presence. He was manifested for your sake who through him are faithful; for all the faithful, whether Jews or Gentiles; "for your glory," St. Paul says (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>). The thought shows the greatness of God's love for his elect. The eternal Son was manifested for their sake; it gives an additional stimulus for Christian effort. That <span class="accented">raised</span> him up from the dead, and gave him glory. St. Peter returns to the "after-glories," which he had mentioned in ver. 11. The death of Christ is the atonement for sin; his resurrection and ascension are the grounds of our confidence and hope. They throw back a halo of Divine glory upon the awful cross; they bring out the beauty and the dignity of the atoning sacrifice; they show that it is accepted, that the work of our redemption is complete. The Resurrection held a very prominent place in the preaching of St. Peter, and, indeed, of all the apostles (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-36</a>; <a href="/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; comp. also <a href="/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>; <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, etc.). That your faith and hope might be in God; rather, <span class="accented">so that your faith and hope are in God - directed</span> towards God (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); or perhaps, as Weiss, Huther, and others, "so that your faith is at the same time hope towards God." The resurrection and the glory of Christ not only inspire the Christian with confidence in God, but they also give his faith the character of hope; they fill it with hope. Christ had promised that where he is there should his servant be; he had prayed that those whom the Father had given him should be with him where he is, to behold his glory. He is in heaven, on the right hand of God. Thus the Christian's faith assumes the attitude of hope; he hopes to be where Christ is, to see him as he is, to be made like unto him. This is "the hope of glory" for which we offer our thanksgivings.
