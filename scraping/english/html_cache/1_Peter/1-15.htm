The concept of God's holiness is central to the Bible, signifying His purity, moral perfection, and separation from sin. In the Old Testament, God's holiness is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim proclaim, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty." The call to holiness is rooted in the character of God Himself, who is the ultimate standard of holiness. The calling of believers is a divine initiative, reflecting God's sovereign choice and purpose, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>, which speaks of those whom God predestined, called, justified, and glorified.<p><b>so be holy</b><br>This command to "be holy" is an imperative for believers to reflect God's holiness in their lives. Holiness involves being set apart for God's purposes and living in a manner that is distinct from the sinful patterns of the world. <a href="/leviticus/11-44.htm">Leviticus 11:44-45</a> provides a foundational understanding of holiness, where God commands the Israelites to be holy because He is holy. This call to holiness is not merely about external behavior but involves an inner transformation and dedication to God. The New Testament continues this theme, with passages like <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>, which states that God has called believers to live a holy life.<p><b>in all you do</b><br>This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the call to holiness, extending to every aspect of a believer's life. Holiness is not limited to religious activities or certain areas of life but encompasses all actions, thoughts, and attitudes. <a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a> echoes this idea, instructing believers to do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. The call to holiness in all things reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which enables believers to live lives that honor God in every situation. This holistic approach to holiness challenges believers to examine their daily lives and align them with God's standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.
