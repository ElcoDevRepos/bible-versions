Shepherding implies guidance, protection, and care, reflecting the role of leaders in the early church. The imagery of shepherding is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, where Jesus is depicted as the Good Shepherd. This connection underscores the responsibility of church leaders to emulate Christ's example. The phrase "God's flock" emphasizes that the people belong to God, not the leaders, reinforcing the idea of stewardship rather than ownership.<p><b>watching over them not out of compulsion, but willingly</b><br>Leaders are encouraged to serve voluntarily, not because they are forced. This reflects the heart of true ministry, which should be motivated by love and a desire to serve God and His people. The concept of willingness aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized serving others out of love (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>). The early church faced various challenges, and leaders were to rise to the occasion with a willing spirit, not merely fulfilling a duty.<p><b>as God would have you</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine standard for leadership. Leaders are to align their actions with God's will, seeking His guidance and approval. This aligns with the biblical principle of seeking God's kingdom and righteousness first (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). It also implies accountability to God, reminding leaders that their ultimate responsibility is to Him, not to human expectations or pressures.<p><b>not out of greed, but out of eagerness</b><br>The warning against greed addresses a common temptation for leaders, emphasizing the need for pure motives. Greed can corrupt leadership, leading to exploitation and self-serving behavior. Instead, leaders are called to serve eagerly, reflecting a genuine passion for ministry. This echoes Paul's teachings in <a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a> and <a href="/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>, where he outlines the qualifications for church leaders, including being free from the love of money. Eagerness in service reflects a heart aligned with God's purposes, prioritizing the well-being of the flock over personal gain.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

When overseers embrace this heart, the church experiences nourishment, protection, and Christ-centered joy, displaying to the watching world the true Shepherd&#8217;s care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Feed the flock of God which is among you.</span>--By the word "feed" here is meant, not merely the giving of pasture, but the whole government. It is the verb used in <a href="/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:16</a>, not that in the 15th and 17th verses. There can be hardly any doubt that St. Peter was thinking of that scene when he issued these directions. Our Lord had committed into his hands all His sheep and lambs, without restriction of age or country, to be fed and shepherded; and now the time was approaching when he would have to "put off this tabernacle" (<a href="/2_peter/1-14.htm" title="Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.">2Peter 1:14</a>), and he here takes order that "after his decease" the charge committed to him. may be fulfilled. He still shepherds the flock by proxy. Two other points must be mentioned, which bring this passage into connection with the charge given by St. Paul to the Ephesian elders (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>), which was very probably known to St. Peter. (1) St. Peter calls it "the flock <span class= "ital">of God.</span>" Textual critics are much divided on the reading in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, but, on the whole, the Received reading seems the best supported: "the Church of God which He hath purchased with His own blood." At the same time, St. Peter is in remembrance how Christ had said, "Feed <span class= "ital">My</span> sheep." It may be fairly thought, therefore, when we see St. Peter's own theology in <a href="/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1Peter 1:25</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-3.htm" title="If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.">1Peter 2:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm" title="But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:">1Peter 3:15</a>, that when he writes, "Feed the flock <span class= "ital">of God," </span>his thoughts turn to the Second Person of the Holy Trinity rather than to the First. (2) Hooker well points out, on <a href="/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>, the <span class= "ital">unity</span> of the flock. Though there were many elders in Ephesus, there was but one flock they fed between them. So now, all over Asia Minor, it was but one flock. St. Peter, to whom the flock throughout the whole world was committed, saw it as a whole, but the elders to whom he writes had only to look to that part of the one flock which was "among them." The marginal rendering is against the order of the Greek words, and does not suit the context so well when the context is rightly understood. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feed the flock of God which is among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tend</span>, as a shepherd tends his flock. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is aorist, as if St. Peter wished to concentrate into one point of view all the labors of the ministerial life. He is echoing the word so solemnly addressed to himself by the risen Lord, "Feed my sheep <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>." The word covers all the various duties of the pastoral office: "Pasce mente, pasce ore, pasce operc, pasce animi oratione, verbi exhortatione, exempli exhibitione" (St. Bernard, quoted by Alford). St. Peter lays stress upon the solemn fact that the flock belongs to God, not to the shepherds (comp. <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>). Some understand the words rendered "which is among you <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> " as meaning" quantum in vobis est," "<span class="accented">as</span> far as lies in your power." Others as "<span class="accented">that</span> which is committed to you," or "that which is placed under your care." But the simple local meaning seems the best. <span class="cmt_word">Taking the oversight thereof.</span> This word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is not found in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts. Alford thinks that "it has, perhaps, been removed for ecclesiastical reasons, for fear <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> should be supposed to be, as they really were, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> It is in the Alexandrine and most other ancient manuscripts and versions, and there seems to be no sufficient reason for omitting it. It shows that when this Epistle was written, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter and bishop, were still synonymous (comp. <a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a> and 28 in the Greek; also <a href="/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> and 7). <span class="cmt_word">Not by constraint, but willingly</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, by constraint, occurs only here. St. Paul says (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), "Necessity is laid upon me;" but that was an inward necessity, the constraining love of Christ. Bede, quoted by Alford, <span class="accented">says</span>, "Coacte pascit gregem, qui propter rerum temporalium penurium non habens unde vivat, idcirco praedicat evangelium ut de evangelio vivere possit." Some good manuscripts add, after "willingly," the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "according to God," i.e. according to his will (comp. <a href="/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not for filthy lucre.</span> The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here (for the thought, comp. <a href="/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>). It would seem that, even in the apostolic age, there were sometimes such opportunities of gain (see <a href="/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) as to be a temptation to enter the ministry for the sake of money. St. Peter uses a strong word in condemnation of such a motive. <span class="cmt_word">But of a ready mind.</span> This adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; it has a stronger meaning than the preceding word <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, willingly; it implies zeal and enthusiasm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Be shepherds</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(poimanate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4165.htm">Strong's 4165: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shepherd, tend, herd; hence: I rule, govern.
