This reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>, where He blesses those who believe without seeing. The early church was composed of many Gentile believers who had come to faith through the testimony of the apostles and other witnesses. Their love for Christ was a response to the transformative power of the Gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in their lives. This love is a fulfillment of the greatest commandment to love God with all one's heart, soul, and mind (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).<p><b>and though you do not see Him now, you believe in Him</b><br>The believers' faith is emphasized here, as they trust in Christ's promises and His presence in their lives despite His physical absence. This faith is rooted in the testimony of the apostles and the Scriptures, which testify to Christ's life, death, and resurrection. <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a> defines faith as the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen, which aligns with the believers' experience. Their belief is not based on sight but on the conviction of the truth of the Gospel and the inner witness of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,</b><br>The joy described here is a profound and overwhelming response to the believers' relationship with Christ. It is a joy that transcends circumstances and is rooted in the hope of salvation and eternal life. This joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is often associated with the presence of God (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The term "inexpressible" suggests that this joy is beyond human words and understanding, reflecting the deep spiritual reality of the believers' union with Christ. The "glorious" aspect of this joy points to its divine origin and its connection to the glory of God revealed in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle of Jesus Christ, traditionally believed to be the author of this epistle.

There seems to be a kind of tender pity in the words, as spoken by one who himself had seen so abundantly (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm" title="For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.">Acts 4:20</a>; <a href="/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>). In this and the following verse we return again from the sorrow to the joy, and to the true cause of that joy, which is only to be found in the love of Jesus Christ. There is another reading, though not so good either in sense or in authority, "whom, without <span class= "ital">knowing</span> Him, ye love." Bengel remarks that this is intended for a paradox, sight and knowledge being the usual parents of love.<p><span class= "bld">Ye love.</span>--The word of calm and divinely-given attachment, in fact the usual word in the New Testament, that which Christ used in questioning the writer (<a href="/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.">John 20:15</a>), not the word of warm human friendship with which St. Peter then answered Him.<p><span class= "bld">In whom.</span>--To be construed, not with "ye rejoice," but with "believing." The participles give the <span class= "ital">grounds</span> of the rejoicing: "because at present without seeing ye believe in Him none the less, therefore ye rejoice." The word "rejoice" takes us back to <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1Peter 1:6</a> : "ye greatly rejoice, I repeat." Notice, again, the stress laid on faith: we have already had it three times mentioned. St. Peter, whose own faith gained him his name and prerogative, is, at least, as much the Apostle of faith as St. Paul is, though his conception of it, perhaps, slightly differs from St. Paul's. The definition given by the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm" title="Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.">Hebrews 11:1</a>) might have been, perhaps was, drawn from a study of St. Peter's writings. Our present verse gives us the leading thought of "faith" as it appears in both of these works addressed to Hebrews, viz., its being the opposite of <span class= "ital">sight, "</span>the evidence of things not seen," rather than as the opposite of <span class= "ital">works.</span> And the main object of both these Epistles is to keep the Hebrews from slipping back from internal to external religion, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>to strengthen <span class= "ital">faith.</span> (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>.) The Apostle is full of admiration for a faith which (unlike his own) was not based on sight. (See <a href="/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>--an incident which may have been in the writer's mind.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom having not seen, ye love</span>. Some ancient manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "although ye know him not:" but the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is best supported, and gives the better sense. The Christians of Asia Minor had not seen the gracious face of the Lord, as St. Peter had. But though they had never known him after the flesh, they knew him by the inner knowledge of spiritual communion, and, having learned to love him, had attained the blessing promised to those who had not seen, but yet had believed. St. Peter may possibly be thinking of his well-remembered interview with the risen Lord (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). He has here the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, expressive of reverential love, which Christ had used in his first two questions; not the word of warm human affection (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ) which he himself had employed in his three answers. In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. The words, "in whom" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "on whom now not looking, but believing"), are to be taken with the participles "seeing" and "believing," not with "ye rejoice." St. Peter insists on the necessity and blessedness of faith as earnestly as St. Paul does, though with him the antithesis is rather between faith and sight than between faith and works. As a tact, St. Peter's readers had never seen the Lord; now, though not seeing him with the outward eye, they realized his presence by faith, and in that presence they rejoiced. The verb is that used in ver. 6 - they rejoiced greatly, they exulted, and that though they saw him not. Human love needs the seen presence of the beloved one to complete the fullness of its joy (2 John 12); but their joy was even amid afflictions unspeakable - like all our deepest and holiest feelings, not to be expressed in words; and it was glorified by the unseen presence of Christ. His chosen behold even now, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, and, beholding, are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Joy in the Lord is a foretaste of the joy of heaven, and is irradiated by glimpses of the glory that shall be revealed. Others, as Huther and Alford, again give to the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye rejoice," a quasi-future sense.
