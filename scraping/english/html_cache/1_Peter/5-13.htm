Historically, Babylon was a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its wealth and power. By the time of the New Testament, Babylon had declined, and some scholars suggest that "Babylon" here is a symbolic reference to Rome, a common practice in early Christian writings to avoid persecution. The use of "Babylon" as a metaphor for Rome is seen in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17-18</a>, where it represents a center of worldly power and opposition to God. The church in Babylon signifies a group of believers who, like those in other parts of the world, are part of the universal body of Christ.<p><b>chosen together with you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the shared experience of election among believers. The concept of being "chosen" is rooted in the Old Testament, where Israel is described as God's chosen people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). In the New Testament, this idea extends to all who are in Christ, highlighting the unity and common purpose among Christians. This shared election is a source of encouragement, reminding believers of their identity and calling in Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>.<p><b>sends you greetings</b><br>The act of sending greetings was a common practice in ancient letters, serving to strengthen bonds and express fellowship among early Christians. This greeting signifies the connection and mutual support between different Christian communities, reflecting the unity of the body of Christ. It also serves as a reminder of the broader network of believers who share in the same faith and mission, as seen in other epistles like <a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a> and <a href="/philippians/4-21.htm">Philippians 4:21</a>.<p><b>as does my son Mark</b><br>Mark, referred to here as "my son," is likely John Mark, the author of the Gospel of Mark. The term "son" indicates a close spiritual relationship, suggesting that Mark was a disciple or mentee of Peter. This relationship is similar to that of Paul and Timothy, where spiritual mentorship and familial language are used (<a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>). Mark's presence with Peter in Babylon (or Rome) aligns with historical accounts of Mark's association with Peter, as noted by early church fathers like Papias. This connection underscores the collaborative nature of early Christian ministry and the transmission of apostolic teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_babylon.htm">The Church in Babylon</a></b><br>This refers to the Christian community that Peter is addressing.

Jeremiah had urged exiles in ancient Babylon to &#8220;seek the welfare of the city&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>), and Peter&#8217;s friends are doing exactly that&#8212;thriving spiritually amid cultural pressure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chosen together with you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Chosen&#8221; echoes Peter&#8217;s opening words to the &#8220;elect&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1&#8211;2</a>) and ties every believer&#8212;whether in Asia Minor or Babylon&#8212;into the same gracious call of God (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This shared election erases distance.

A man once hesitant (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>) now stands firm beside Peter, illustrating redemption and growth.

Some, therefore, seeing immediately after, "Marcus, my son," and knowing that St. Peter was a married man (<a href="/matthew/8-14.htm" title="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.">Matthew 8:14</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1Corinthians 9:5</a>), have thought that this "co-elect one" was St. Peter's wife. But (1) it is highly improbable that St. Mark was in that sense "son" to St. Peter; (2) quite as improbable that she would have been put so prominently forward in such an Epistle; (3) the word "co-elect" evidently refers back to <a href="/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1Peter 1:2</a>, and means "co-elect with <span class= "ital">you," </span>not "with me." It was becoming a not infrequent mode of designating a church, to personify it under a female title (see <a href="/2_john/1-1.htm" title="The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;">2John 1:1</a>; <a href="/context/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1Peter 1:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1Peter 1:13</a>); and it seems therefore much more natural to suppose that the salutation is from this church of "Babylon" to her sister churches in the provinces of Asia Minor. The modesty with which this church at "Babylon" is spoken of, as being only one of many "co-elect" ones is noteworthy. She does not claim such a position among churches as (<span class= "ital">e.g.</span>) in <a href="/context/songs/6-8.htm" title="There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.">Song of Solomon 6:8-9</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the co-elect in Babylon</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>. The word "Church" is given in no manuscripts with the remarkable exception of the Sinaitic; the rest have simply "the co-elect." We ask - What word is to be supplied, "Church" or "sister"? Some think that St, Peter's wife (comp. <a href="/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>) is intended, or some other well-known Christian woman (comp. <a href="/2_john/1.htm">2 John 1</a>). In favor of this view is the following salutation from Marcus. It is more natural to join together the names of two persons than to couple a Church with an individual. Also it scorns exceedingly improbable that such a word as "Church" should be omitted (a word, we may remark, which occurs nowhere in St. Peter's Epistles), and the ellipse left to be filled up by the readers. On the other hand, it is said to be unlikely that a humble Galilaean woman should be described as "the co-elect in Babylon." This argument would have considerable weight if the apostle were writing from large and well-known Church, like that at Rome; but it is quite possible that "the co-elect" might be the only Christian woman, or the one best known among a very small number in Babylon. On the whole, it seems most probable to us that by "the co-elect" (whether we supply "together with you" or "with me") is meant a Christian woman known at least by name to the Churches of Asia Miner, and therefore very possibly St. Peter's wife, who, St. Paul tells us, was his companion in travel. The question now meets us - Is "Babylon" to be taken in a mystic sense, as a cryptograph for Rome, or literally? Eusebius, and ancient writers generally, understand it of Rome. Eusebius is commonly understood to claim for this view the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria (as has been stated in the Introduction, p. 9.). But the historian's words ('Hist. Eccl.,' 1. 15. 2) seem to claim that authority only for the connection of St. Peter with St. Mark's Gospel; the identification of Babylon with Rome seems to be mentioned only as a common opinion in the time of Eusebius. It is said that there is n o trace o f the existence of a Christian Church at the Chaldean Babylon, and no proof, apart from this passage, that St. Peter was ever there. There had been a great Jewish colony at Babylon, but it had been destroyed in the time of Caligula. In answer to these arguments, it may be urged that the cryptograph of Babylon for Rome would probably not be understood; even if we assume the earliest date assigned to the Apocalypse, that book could scarcely be known very generally in Asia Minor when this Epistle was written. St. Peter at Babylon, like St. Paul at Athens, may have met with little success; the infant Church may have been quickly crushed. There may have been a second settlement of Jews at Babylon between A.D. and the date of this Epistle. But it is quite possible that St. Peter may have been working as a missionary among the Babylonian Gentiles, for we cannot believe that he confined his ministrations to the Jews. On the whole, it seems much more probable that St. Peter was writing at the famous city on the Euphrates, though no traces of his work there remain, than that he should have used this one word in a mystical sense at the end of an Epistle where all else is plain and simple (see this question discussed in the Introduction, p. 9.). <span class="cmt_word">And so doth Marcus my son</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the word used by St. Paul of spiritual relationship (see <a href="/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>). St. Peter has <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> here. Still, it seems most probable that Marcus, mentioned as he is without any further description, is not a son of the apostle after the flesh, but the well-known John Mark of the Acts (see Introduction, p. 8.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The church]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
