This reflects the teaching of Jesus in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>) and highlights the familial bond between God and His children. The concept of God as Father is rooted in the Old Testament, where God is seen as the Father of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>). This relationship implies both privilege and responsibility for believers.<p><b>who judges each one&#8217;s work impartially</b><br>God's impartial judgment is a consistent biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-11</a>, where God is described as rewarding or punishing individuals based on their deeds, without favoritism. This impartiality underscores God's justice and holiness, reminding believers that their actions are significant and will be evaluated. The idea of divine judgment is also present in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, where God is said to bring every deed into judgment.<p><b>conduct yourselves in reverent fear</b><br>Reverent fear is a profound respect and awe for God, recognizing His holiness and authority. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. It is not a paralyzing fear but a motivating force for holy living. The call to live in reverent fear is a reminder of the believer's accountability to God and the need for a life that reflects His character.<p><b>during your stay as foreigners</b><br>This phrase highlights the temporary nature of the believer's life on earth, echoing the theme of pilgrimage found throughout Scripture. <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a> speaks of the patriarchs as strangers and exiles on the earth, seeking a heavenly homeland.

(See Note on <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1Thessalonians 4:14</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Ye call on the Father.</span>--We might paraphrase by "if you use the Lord's Prayer." (Refer again to <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,">1Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm" title="As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:">1Peter 1:14</a>.) The word seems not only to mean "if you <span class= "ital">appeal</span> to the Father," but "if you appeal to the Father by the <span class= "ital">title</span> of Father." (Comp. <a href="/romans/8-15.htm" title="For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - And if ye call on the Father. "If" does not imply doubt; it introduces an hypothesis which, being taken for granted, involves a duty. Apparently there is here a reference to the Lord's Prayer, as in <a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. You call on God as your Father; then pass your time in fear (comp. <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, "If I be a Father, where is mine honor?"). He called you first; now ye call on him. The translation of the Revised Version is more exact than the Authorized Version, "If ye call on him as Father." Who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "without respect of persons," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the thought is familiar. St. Peter himself had said, when he was sent to receive Cornelius into the Church, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons" (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The disciples of the Pharisees had said the same of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; comp. also <a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>). The Lord said (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son." But the Father is "Fens judicii," as Didymus says (quoted by Alford), "judicante Filio, Pater est qu;. judicat," for the Son judges as his Delegate; as it was through the Son that the Father made the worlds. He judges according to every man's work, regarding, not distinctions of rank, or wealth, or nationality, but only the character of the work. Observe that the word "work" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is in the singular number, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. God judges according to every man's work as a whole, according to the whole scope and meaning of his life as issuing from the one governing principle, whether faith or selfishness. So Bengel, "Unius hominis unum est opus, bouum malumve." Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. The verb here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, corresponds with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> ("conversation") of ver. 15; both might be rendered (as Dean Plumptre suggests) by "conduct" (noun or verb) - "in all your conduct" in ver. 15; and here, "conduct yourselves." The word "sojourning" reminds us of ver. 1 of this chapter and of <a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, in which last place we have the corresponding Greek word. We are sojourners here, life is short; but the character of that short life determines our eternal condition; therefore live in fear. St. John says, "Perfect love casteth out fear;" but there is no contradiction, as some have said, between the two holy apostles; for the fear which cannot coexist with perfect love (it may in various measures coexist with imperfect love) is slavish fear, selfish fear of death and punishment. The fear which St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>) commend is holy fear - the fear of a son for a loving father, the fear of displeasing God before whom we walk, God who gave his blessed Son to die for us, God who will judge us at the last. This fear is not cowardice. Our Lord said (<a href="/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>), "Be not afraid of them that kill the body.... Fear him," etc. They who fear God need fear nothing else but God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_peter/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Since</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
