The early church faced persecution, and this call to rejoice would have been a radical departure from the natural human response to suffering.<p><b>that you share in the sufferings of Christ</b><br>Sharing in Christ's sufferings means participating in the same kind of trials and persecutions that Jesus endured. This concept is rooted in the idea of fellowship with Christ, as seen in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. The early Christians understood that suffering for their faith was a way to identify with Jesus, who suffered for humanity's redemption.<p><b>so that you may be overjoyed</b><br>The future promise of joy is a recurring theme in the New Testament.

Suffering meekly borne draws the Christian nearer to Christ, lifts him, as on a cross, nearer to the crucified Lord; but this it does only when he looks to Jesus in his suffering, when the eye of faith is fixed upon the cross of Christ. Then faith unites the sufferings of the disciple with the sufferings of his Lord; he is made a partaker of Christ's sufferings; and so far as suffering has that blessed result, in such measure he must rejoice in his sufferings.
