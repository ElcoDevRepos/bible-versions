The context of 1 Peter is addressing Christians who are experiencing persecution and trials. The calling here is not just to salvation but to a life that mirrors Christ's own experience, including suffering. This aligns with passages like <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, which speaks of sharing in Christ's sufferings in order to share in His glory.<p><b>because Christ also suffered for you</b><br>Christ's suffering is central to the Christian faith, serving as the ultimate act of love and sacrifice. This suffering was prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which describes the Messiah as a suffering servant. The historical context of Christ's crucifixion under Roman rule highlights the extent of His suffering, both physically and spiritually, as He bore the sins of humanity. This act is foundational for the atonement and redemption of believers.<p><b>leaving you an example</b><br>The Greek word for "example" here is "hypogrammon," which refers to a pattern or model to be followed. Christ's life and suffering provide a template for Christian conduct, especially in the face of adversity. This concept is echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>, where believers are encouraged to have the same mindset as Christ, who humbled Himself and became obedient to death.<p><b>that you should follow in His footsteps</b><br>Following in Christ's footsteps implies a life of discipleship and imitation of His character and actions. This includes enduring suffering with patience and faith, as well as living a life of holiness and obedience to God's will. The imagery of walking in someone's footsteps suggests a close and intentional following, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>, where Jesus instructs His disciples to do as He has done. This call to follow is both a privilege and a responsibility for believers, as they seek to reflect Christ in their daily lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>The apostle Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, is the author of this epistle.

He left a clear pattern&#8212;humble obedience, non-retaliation, and trust in the Father&#8212;so that we might walk the same path, confident that the God who called us will also sustain and reward us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_peter/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For even hereunto were ye called.</span>--Namely, to the combination of suffering and well-doing. To this they "were called" by the Gospel which St. Paul had preached to them; it ought not to be a surprise to them when it comes. (See <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm" title="Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:">1Peter 4:12</a>.) It was a special point in St. Paul's preaching to forewarn fairly of the tribulations attending all who wished to enter the kingdom of God. Comp. <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.">1Thessalonians 3:3-4</a>, and <a href="/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22</a>, which latter passage refers to preaching in the very homes of some of the recipients of this Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Because.</span>--This justifies the last assertion. It appeared on the very face of the gospel message that we should all (slave and freeman alike) have to do well, and at the same time suffer, because the gospel told us that it was so with Him, the subject of the gospel. Notice what a fine assumption lies in this "because"--viz., that Christ's experience must needs be that of every Christian.<p><span class= "bld">Christ also suffered.</span>--It is to be carefully observed again that he does not say "<span class= "ital">Jesus</span> suffered;" the whole point is that these Hebrew Christians have given in their adhesion to a <span class= "ital">suffering Messiah.</span> (See Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm" title="Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.">1Peter 1:11</a>.) And the true reading immediately after is "for <span class= "ital">you, </span>leaving <span class= "ital">you</span> an example, that ye should follow His steps;" not, of course, that St. Peter exempts himself from the need of the atonement or the obligation of following Christ's steps, but because it is his accustomed style to give a charge (as it were) rather than to throw himself in with those whom he addresses. (See Note on <a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>.) There is one important point to be observed. Christ is said to have suffered "for you," but this does not mean "in your <span class= "ital">stead</span>" but "on your behalf, for your good." Christ's atonement for us is not represented in this passage as <span class= "ital">vicarious.</span> He did not, according to St. Peter's teaching, die as a <span class= "ital">substitute</span> for us, any more than He <span class= "ital">rose again</span> as our substitute. So far as the words themselves go, the death of the Messiah "for us" might have been such a death as that of the hero who, in the battle of Murgarten, gathered the Austrian spears like a sheaf into his own bosom, "<span class= "ital">for</span>" his fellow-patriots, clearing the way for them to follow. The addition "for you" conveys the thought that in gratitude we ought to suffer with, or even for, Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_peter/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For even hereunto were ye called</span>; that is, to do good and to suffer patiently (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/3-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). Omit "even," for which there is no authority. St. Peter is speaking of slaves, but what he says of slaves is true in some sense of all Christians (comp. <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because Christ also suffered for us</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for you</span>, with the oldest manuscripts.

It means a copy set by a writing or drawing master, which was to be exactly reproduced by his pupils (see 2 Macc. 2:28, in the Greek). The life of Christ is our model.
