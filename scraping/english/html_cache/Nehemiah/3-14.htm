It was named for its function as the exit point for waste materials, leading to the Valley of Hinnom. This gate's name and purpose highlight the practical aspects of city life in ancient Jerusalem, emphasizing the need for cleanliness and order. The Valley of Hinnom, associated with this gate, later became a symbol of judgment and hell (Gehenna) in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>).<p><b>was repaired by Malchijah son of Rechab</b><br>Malchijah, whose name means "My King is Yahweh," was a significant figure in the rebuilding efforts. The mention of his lineage, "son of Rechab," connects him to the Rechabites, a group known for their faithfulness and adherence to a nomadic lifestyle as commanded by their ancestor Jonadab (Jeremiah 35). This connection underscores the theme of covenant faithfulness and obedience to God.<p><b>ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem</b><br>Beth-haccherem, meaning "House of the Vineyard," was a district located near Jerusalem. As a ruler of this area, Malchijah held a position of authority and responsibility. This highlights the collaborative effort in Nehemiah's project, where leaders from various regions contributed to the restoration of Jerusalem's walls. The involvement of regional leaders signifies the unity and collective commitment of the people to God's work.<p><b>He rebuilt it and installed its doors, bolts, and bars</b><br>The detailed description of the reconstruction work&#8212;rebuilding and installing doors, bolts, and bars&#8212;emphasizes the thoroughness and security of the restoration.
