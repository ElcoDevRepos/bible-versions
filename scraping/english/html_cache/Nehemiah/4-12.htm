The context is the mid-5th century BC, a time of significant opposition from surrounding peoples. The phrase indicates a moment of heightened tension and threat, emphasizing the urgency and danger faced by the Jewish community.<p><b>the Jews who lived nearby</b><br>These Jews were likely those residing in the surrounding areas of Judah, outside the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Their proximity to hostile groups such as the Samaritans, Ammonites, and others made them more aware of the threats. This highlights the broader Jewish community's involvement and concern for the safety and success of the rebuilding efforts.<p><b>came and told us ten times over</b><br>The repetition of the warning "ten times over" underscores the seriousness and persistence of the threat. In biblical terms, the number ten often signifies completeness or intensity. This repeated warning reflects the genuine fear and urgency felt by the Jews, emphasizing the need for vigilance and preparedness.<p><b>&#8220;Wherever you turn, they will attack us.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase captures the sense of being surrounded by enemies, with no safe direction to turn. It reflects the strategic disadvantage and vulnerability of the Jews at that time. The threat of attack from all sides is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God's people faced overwhelming odds, such as in <a href="/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15-17</a>, where Elisha's servant sees the surrounding enemy but is reassured by God's protection.
