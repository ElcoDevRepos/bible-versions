This teamwork reflects the unity and shared purpose among the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of community in accomplishing God's work. The rebuilding project required coordination and cooperation, symbolizing the body of Christ working together with different gifts and roles (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs</b><br>Jedaiah, whose name means "God knows," is identified as the son of Harumaph. The mention of his lineage highlights the importance of family heritage and identity in Jewish culture. The act of making repairs signifies personal involvement and responsibility in restoring what was broken, a theme that resonates with the call for believers to participate in the restoration of God's kingdom on earth.<p><b>across from his house</b><br>The location "across from his house" suggests that Jedaiah was repairing the section of the wall nearest to his own dwelling. This personal investment in the work underscores the principle of stewardship and the idea that one's immediate environment is a primary area of responsibility. It also reflects the practical strategy of Nehemiah to engage people in rebuilding efforts that directly affected their own lives and security.<p><b>and next to him</b><br>This repetition of "next to him" reinforces the theme of unity and continuity in the rebuilding process. It serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of the community, where each person's work supports and complements the efforts of others. This mirrors the biblical principle of believers being interconnected as members of one body, each contributing to the whole (<a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p><b>Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs</b><br>Hattush, meaning "assembled," is another individual contributing to the reconstruction. His lineage, being the son of Hashabneiah, is noted, which may indicate a family known for their faithfulness or skill. The act of making repairs by Hattush further exemplifies the collective commitment to restoring Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish identity and worship. This restoration can be seen as a type of Christ's work in restoring humanity to God, as He repairs the breach caused by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jedaiah_son_of_harumaph.htm">Jedaiah son of Harumaph</a></b><br>A worker involved in the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem.
