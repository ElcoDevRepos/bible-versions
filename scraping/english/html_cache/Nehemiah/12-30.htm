In the Old Testament, purification often involved washing with water, offering sacrifices, and abstaining from certain activities (<a href="/leviticus/16-30.htm">Leviticus 16:30</a>, <a href="/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-7</a>). This act underscores the necessity for those who serve in the temple to be ceremonially clean, reflecting the holiness required by God. The priests and Levites, as spiritual leaders, set an example for the people, highlighting the principle that leaders must first be right with God before leading others in worship.<p><b>they purified the people</b><br>The purification of the people indicates a communal preparation for worship and dedication. This act likely involved ceremonial washings and possibly sacrifices, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-14</a>). It reflects the collective responsibility of the community to be pure before God, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and His people. This purification is a precursor to worship and celebration, ensuring that the community is spiritually prepared to participate in the dedication of the wall.<p><b>the gates, and the wall</b><br>Purifying the gates and the wall symbolizes the sanctification of the entire city, not just the people. This act signifies that the physical structures, which represent security and identity for Jerusalem, are dedicated to God. The gates and walls are not merely defensive structures but are seen as part of the holy city, set apart for God's purposes. This dedication can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate gate and wall for believers, providing protection and sanctification (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>, <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>). The act of purifying these structures also connects to the broader biblical theme of God dwelling among His people, as seen in the dedication of the temple (<a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_and_levites.htm">Priests and Levites</a></b><br>These were the religious leaders responsible for the spiritual oversight of the Israelites.
