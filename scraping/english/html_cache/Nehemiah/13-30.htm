The priests and Levites were set apart for sacred duties, and any foreign influence could lead to idolatry or syncretism, which was a recurring issue in Israel's history (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>). The purification process likely involved both physical and spiritual cleansing, aligning with the Levitical laws (<a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6-8</a>).

This mirrors the original division of duties among the Levites as outlined in <a href="/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3 and 4</a>, where specific tasks were assigned to different families. Such structure is crucial for maintaining the integrity of worship and ensuring that God's commands are followed precisely.
