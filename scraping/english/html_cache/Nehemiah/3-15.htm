Shallun, identified as the son of Col-hozeh, was a leader in Mizpah, a region north of Jerusalem. His involvement highlights the collaborative effort among various leaders and regions in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. Mizpah was historically significant as a gathering place for Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>) and a center of governance during the time of the judges.<p><b>He rebuilt it, roofed it, and installed its doors, bolts, and bars.</b><br>The detailed description of the reconstruction work&#8212;rebuilding, roofing, and installing doors, bolts, and bars&#8212;emphasizes the thoroughness and security measures taken. This reflects the importance of protecting the city from potential threats. The use of bolts and bars indicates a focus on fortification, ensuring that the gate was not only functional but also secure against enemies, a common concern in ancient city defenses.<p><b>He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Shelah near the king&#8217;s garden,</b><br>The Pool of Shelah, also known as the Pool of Siloam, was an essential water reservoir in Jerusalem, fed by the Gihon Spring through Hezekiah's Tunnel. This pool played a significant role in the city's water supply and was later mentioned in the New Testament (<a href="/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>) as the site where Jesus healed a blind man. The king's garden, likely a royal park or orchard, indicates the area's importance and proximity to the royal residence, underscoring the strategic and aesthetic value of this section of the wall.<p><b>as far as the stairs that descend from the City of David.</b><br>The City of David refers to the oldest settled area of Jerusalem, located on the southeastern hill. The stairs mentioned here likely provided access from the City of David to the lower parts of Jerusalem, facilitating movement and trade. This connection to the City of David highlights the historical and spiritual significance of the area, as it was the original stronghold captured by King David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>) and became the political and spiritual center of Israel. The restoration of this section of the wall would have been crucial for maintaining the integrity and heritage of the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallun.htm">Shallun</a></b><br>The son of Col-Hozeh and ruler of the district of Mizpah.
