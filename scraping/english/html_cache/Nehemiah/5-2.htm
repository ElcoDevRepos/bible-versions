It reflects the communal nature of the Jewish society during Nehemiah's time, where the well-being of the community was a shared concern. This communal approach is seen throughout the Old Testament, where the actions and conditions of individuals often impact the entire community, as in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a> with Achan's sin affecting Israel.<p><b>&#8220;We and our sons and daughters are numerous.</b><br>The mention of sons and daughters highlights the family structure and the importance of children in Jewish culture. Large families were common and seen as a blessing from God, as indicated in <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>. The emphasis on numerous offspring also underscores the severity of the situation, as more mouths to feed increased the urgency of their plight.<p><b>We must get grain</b><br>Grain was a staple food in ancient Israel, essential for survival. The need to "get grain" suggests a shortage or difficulty in accessing this basic necessity, possibly due to economic exploitation or poor harvests. This situation echoes the famine in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, where Joseph's management of grain saved Egypt and surrounding nations, highlighting the critical role of grain in sustaining life.<p><b>in order to eat and stay alive.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the dire circumstances faced by the people, where basic survival was at stake. It reflects the broader theme of dependence on God for provision, as seen in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>) where Jesus teaches to pray for daily bread. The struggle for sustenance also parallels the Israelites' reliance on manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), emphasizing God's provision in times of need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
