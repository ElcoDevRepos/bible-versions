It was later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>). The Sabbath served as a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). It was a day set apart for rest and worship, symbolizing God's rest and the future rest believers would find in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). The revelation of the Sabbath to Israel emphasized God's desire for His people to trust in His provision and to prioritize spiritual over material pursuits.<p><b>and gave them commandments and statutes and laws</b><br>The giving of commandments, statutes, and laws refers to the comprehensive legal and moral code provided to Israel at Mount Sinai. This included the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>) and the broader Mosaic Law, which covered religious, civil, and moral aspects of life. These laws were designed to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>) and to guide them in their relationship with God and others. The law also served as a tutor to lead people to Christ by highlighting the need for a Savior (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>).<p><b>through Your servant Moses</b><br>Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament, chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai.
