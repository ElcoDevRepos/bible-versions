The Samaritans were a mixed population, partly descended from Israelites left in the land after the Assyrian conquest and partly from foreign settlers. This context highlights the longstanding animosity between Jews and Samaritans, which is evident in other biblical accounts, such as <a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>. The presence of the army suggests a significant threat to the Jews' efforts, emphasizing the political and military tension of the period.<p><b>&#8220;What are these feeble Jews doing?</b><br>Sanballat's derogatory reference to the Jews as "feeble" underscores the perception of their vulnerability and weakness. Historically, the Jews had returned from exile and were in the process of rebuilding their community and identity. This taunt reflects the broader theme of opposition faced by God's people throughout scripture, as seen in the stories of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17) and the Israelites in Egypt (Exodus 1).<p><b>Can they restore the wall by themselves?</b><br>The question challenges the Jews' ability to rebuild Jerusalem's walls without external help. This reflects the broader biblical theme of reliance on God rather than human strength, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," says the Lord Almighty. The rebuilding of the wall is a physical manifestation of spiritual renewal and protection.<p><b>Will they offer sacrifices?</b><br>This question mocks the Jews' religious practices, suggesting that their spiritual rituals are futile in the face of such a daunting task. Sacrifices were central to Jewish worship and covenant relationship with God, as outlined in Leviticus. The implication is that their faith and religious observance are insufficient for the practical challenges they face.<p><b>Will they complete it in a day?</b><br>Sanballat's sarcasm here highlights the enormity of the task and the improbability of quick success. The rebuilding of the wall was indeed a monumental task, requiring perseverance and divine assistance. This echoes the biblical principle of patience and endurance in faith, as seen in <a href="/james/1-4.htm">James 1:4</a>, which encourages believers to let perseverance finish its work.<p><b>Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of "burnt stones" and "mounds of rubble" emphasizes the destruction and desolation of Jerusalem. The stones, likely damaged by fire during the Babylonian conquest, symbolize the seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This phrase can be seen as a metaphor for restoration and resurrection, themes central to the Christian faith, as exemplified in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The idea of bringing life from death is a powerful motif throughout scripture, pointing to God's ability to restore and renew.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat.htm">Sanballat</a></b><br>A prominent adversary of Nehemiah, Sanballat was a Samaritan leader who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

By "his brethren" would seem to be meant his chief counsellors - probably Tobiah among them<span class="cmt_word">. The army of Samaria</span>. Some understand by this a Persian garrison, stationed in Samaria under its own commander, with which Sanballat had influence (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 153), but there is no real ground for such a supposition. <a href="/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, belongs probably to David's time; and as Samaria had doubtless its own native force of armed citizens, who were Sanballat's subjects, it is quite unnecessary to suppose that he addressed himself to any other "army" than this. The Persians would maintain a force in Damascus, but scarcely in Samaria; and Persian soldiers, had there been any in that city, would have been more likely to support a royal cupbearer than a petty governor with no influence at court. We can really only explain the disturbed state of things and approach to open hostility which appears in Nehemiah's narrative, by the weakness of Persia in these parts, and the consequent power of the native races to act pretty much as they pleased - even to the extent of making war one upon another<span class="cmt_word">. Will they fortify themselves?</span> No other rendering is tenable. Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 3. p. 154, note 5)defends it successfully<span class="cmt_word">. Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day?</span> The meaning seems to be, "Will they begin and make an end in a day?" It is assumed that they will begin by offering a sacrifice to inaugurate their work. <span class="cmt_word">Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</span> Rather, "Will they revive the burnt stones (the stones that are burned) out of the heaps of the rubbish?" Will they do what is im-possible-solidify and make into real stone the calcined and crumbling blocks which are all that they will find in the heaps of rubbish? If not, how are they to procure material? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
