The law referred to here is likely the command found in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>, which prohibits Ammonites and Moabites from entering the assembly of the Lord. This immediate action reflects a strong commitment to obedience and a desire to align with God's commands. Historically, this period follows the return from Babylonian exile, a time when the Israelites were particularly focused on re-establishing their identity and purity as God's chosen people.<p><b>they excluded from Israel</b><br>The act of exclusion signifies a separation to maintain the holiness of the community. This was not merely a social or ethnic separation but a spiritual one, intended to preserve the religious integrity of Israel. The exclusion was a practical application of the law to prevent the influence of foreign practices and idolatry, which had previously led Israel astray. This action echoes the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah, who were instrumental in restoring the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>all of foreign descent</b><br>The term "foreign descent" refers to those who were not part of the covenant community of Israel. This exclusion was not based on ethnicity alone but on religious and cultural practices that were contrary to the worship of Yahweh. The historical context includes the intermarriage with foreign nations, which had introduced idolatry and compromised the distinctiveness of Israel's worship. This separation is reminiscent of the call to holiness found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, where God commands His people to be holy as He is holy.<br><br>In summary, <a href="/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a> reflects a decisive moment of reform and commitment to God's law, emphasizing the importance of spiritual purity and obedience. This action is part of a broader narrative of restoration and covenant renewal, highlighting the ongoing struggle to maintain faithfulness amidst external influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the people.

The &#8220;law&#8221; just read aloud was <a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>, which forbade Ammonites and Moabites from entering the congregation because they had opposed Israel and hired Balaam to curse them (<a href="/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1-2</a>). The public reading of Scripture (see <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2-8</a>) freshly reminded everyone of God&#8217;s clear command, proving again that &#8220;faith comes by hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Immediate obedience</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;they excluded&#8230;&#8221; The response was swift; no committees, no delays. Like Israel at Sinai who said, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>), and like the psalmist who &#8220;hurried and did not delay&#8221; to keep God&#8217;s commands (<a href="/psalms/119-60.htm">Psalm 119:60</a>), the returned exiles practiced <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> by being doers, not hearers only.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They excluded</b><p>Separation here meant removing those who chose to remain identified with pagan nations from Israel&#8217;s worship assembly (<a href="/ezra/10-3.htm">Ezra 10:3</a>). This was not ethnic hostility but covenant obedience designed to guard against idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). Solomon&#8217;s downfall through foreign wives (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-8</a>) stood as a cautionary tale. The New Testament reiterates the same moral principle&#8212;&#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Israel</b><p>The phrase underscores Israel&#8217;s distinct calling: &#8220;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Holiness required drawing clear lines around the covenant community (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). Today, believers are likewise called &#8220;a chosen race&#8221; and must maintain spiritual distinctiveness while showing Christ&#8217;s love (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; <a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All of foreign descent</b><p>Those excluded were people persisting in foreign allegiance, not repentant outsiders who embraced Israel&#8217;s God.

Isaiah foresaw a day when foreigners who &#8220;bind themselves to the LORD&#8221; would be welcomed (<a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3-8</a>), a promise fulfilled in Christ who makes believing Gentiles &#8220;fellow citizens with the saints&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>) and grafts them into the covenant people (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a> illustrates the power of God&#8217;s Word to expose sin and prompt decisive obedience.

The rebukes of Nehemiah (vers. 25-27) did not suffice to produce a voluntary putting away of the foreign wives. Judicial proceedings had to be taken, and the "mixed multitude" separated off by authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
