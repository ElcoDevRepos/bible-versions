The outcry he heard was from the Jewish people who were suffering under economic oppression by their own countrymen. This situation reflects the social injustices that were prevalent during the post-exilic period. The complaints were about the exploitation through high-interest loans and the selling of children into slavery to pay debts, which was against the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>). This highlights the importance of community and justice in the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>I became extremely angry,</b><br>Nehemiah's anger is a righteous indignation, similar to the anger of Jesus when He cleansed the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>). This anger is not sinful but is a response to the violation of God's laws and the mistreatment of His people. Nehemiah's reaction is a call to action, demonstrating leadership that aligns with God's heart for justice and compassion. His response is also reminiscent of the prophets who spoke against social injustices, such as Amos and Isaiah, emphasizing the need for leaders to advocate for the oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes.

Nehemiah models a leader who tunes his ear to the people instead of blocking them out.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s own attentiveness: &#8220;I have heard them cry out because of their taskmasters&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Our response, like Nehemiah&#8217;s, begins with genuine listening; <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> reminds believers to be &#8220;quick to listen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because the verse records an actual moment, we see that attentive hearing is not optional&#8212;it is the first literal step toward justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their outcry</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Outcry&#8221; signals deep distress, much like Israel&#8217;s groaning in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23&#8211;25</a>.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a> warns, &#8220;Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too shall cry out and receive no answer.&#8221; Nehemiah refuses to be that person.<p>&#8226; The community&#8217;s pain was economic and familial: land, grain, and children were at risk (<a href="/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; By recognizing the outcry, Nehemiah mirrors God&#8217;s heart described in <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>: &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and these complaints</b><p>&#8226; The complaints were specific, not vague:<p>&#8211; Heavy interest rates (contrary to <a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8211; Loss of property and freedom (violating <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35&#8211;40</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming injustices openly brings them into the light; <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a> condemns those who &#8220;add house to house&#8221; at others&#8217; expense.<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s literal commands against exploitation remain binding, establishing a clear moral standard for God&#8217;s people in every age.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I became extremely angry</b><p>&#8226; Anger can be righteous when it mirrors God&#8217;s hatred of oppression; &#8220;God is a righteous Judge &#8230; a God who shows His wrath every day&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself &#8220;looked around at them with anger&#8221; over hardened hearts (<a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a> gives the boundary: &#8220;Be angry, yet do not sin.&#8221; Nehemiah&#8217;s anger is not a loss of control; it propels him to corrective action (<a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Authentic faith does not stay passive in the face of sin. Righteous anger, submitted to God, protects the vulnerable and restores obedience to His Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/5-6.htm">Nehemiah 5:6</a> shows a chain of godly leadership: he hears, acknowledges the people&#8217;s outcry, identifies concrete injustices, and responds with righteous anger that drives reform.

The common wailing and the three complaints in which it found expression are distinct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was very angry</span>. It is not clear that the letter of the law was infringed, unless it were in the matter of taking interest (ver. 11), of which the people had not complained. That men might sell their daughters to be concubines or secondary wives is clear from <a href="/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>; and it is therefore probable that they might sell their sons for servants. But the servitude might only be for six years (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>); and if a jubilee year occurred before the sexennial period was out, the service was ended (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). Land too might be either mortgaged or sold (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. vers. 14-16), but under the condition that it returned to the seller, or at any rate to his tribe, in the jubilee year (ibid. vers. 10, 13). The spirit, however, of the law - the command, "Ye shall not oppress one another" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 14, 17) - was transgressed by the proceedings of the rich men. It was their duty in a time of scarcity not to press hard upon their poorer brethren, but freely to alleviate their necessities. Nehemiah, his near relations, and his followers had done so to the utmost of their power (ver. 10, with the comment). The rich men had acted differently, and made all the profit that they could out of the need of their fellow-countrymen. Hence Nehemiah's anger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
