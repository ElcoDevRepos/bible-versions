Its large and spacious nature reflects its former glory before the Babylonian exile. The city was designed to accommodate a large population, with ample space for the temple, marketplaces, and residential areas. This description highlights the potential for growth and restoration, aligning with God's promises to restore Israel. The spaciousness also symbolizes the spiritual capacity for renewal and revival among the people.<p><b>but there were few people in it</b><br>The sparse population is a direct result of the Babylonian exile, where many Jews were taken captive, and only a remnant returned under the leadership of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah. This situation underscores the challenges Nehemiah faced in rebuilding not just the physical walls but also the community and spiritual life of Jerusalem. The few people present represent the faithful remnant, a recurring theme in Scripture, where God often works through a small, dedicated group to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>and the houses had not yet been rebuilt</b><br>The lack of rebuilt houses indicates the incomplete state of Jerusalem's restoration. While the walls had been reconstructed under Nehemiah's leadership, the infrastructure necessary for a thriving community was still lacking. This reflects the ongoing process of restoration that requires both physical and spiritual rebuilding. The unrebuilt houses symbolize the need for the people to establish their lives and families in the city, fulfilling prophecies of return and restoration found in books like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The rebuilding of homes can also be seen as a metaphor for the restoration of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.

Like <a href="/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>&#8212;&#8220;Enlarge the place of your tent&#8221;&#8212;He prepares room for growth before it happens.<p>- A roomy city also recalls Solomon&#8217;s era, when Jerusalem bustled with people (<a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>). The rebuilt walls invite the people to envision that flourishing again.<p>- <a href="/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a> describes the city once laid waste; Nehemiah&#8217;s work reversed that shame and set the stage for future blessing (<a href="/psalms/102-16.htm">Psalm 102:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there were few people in it</b><p>- Though the exile was over, only a remnant had returned (<a href="/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64-65</a>).
