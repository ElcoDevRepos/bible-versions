In biblical numerology, the number five can symbolize grace, but here it underscores the relentless opposition Nehemiah faced. The repeated attempts to distract and intimidate Nehemiah highlight the spiritual warfare often encountered by those doing God's work. This persistence can be compared to the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>, emphasizing the need for perseverance in the face of opposition.<p><b>Sanballat sent me</b><br>Sanballat was a prominent leader of the Samaritans and an adversary of Nehemiah. His opposition to the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls reflects the historical animosity between the Samaritans and the Jews, which is also evident in the New Testament (<a href="/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>). Sanballat's actions are typical of the political and social tensions of the time, as local leaders often resisted changes that threatened their power or influence.<p><b>this same message</b><br>The message Sanballat sent was a repeated attempt to lure Nehemiah away from his work. This reflects a common tactic of the enemy: distraction. In the broader biblical narrative, similar strategies are used by adversaries to divert God's people from their mission, as seen in the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>by his young servant</b><br>The use of a young servant to deliver the message may indicate a strategy to make the communication seem less threatening or official. In ancient Near Eastern culture, messengers often held positions of trust and were used to convey important information. This detail highlights the subtlety and cunning often employed by those opposing God's work.<p><b>who had in his hand an unsealed letter</b><br>An unsealed letter was unusual for official correspondence, which was typically sealed to ensure privacy and authenticity. The unsealed nature of the letter suggests an intention for the contents to become public, potentially to spread rumors or incite fear. This tactic of spreading false information is reminiscent of the accusations against Jesus, where false witnesses were used to undermine His mission (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56-59</a>). The openness of the letter also reflects the transparency of the enemy's tactics, which can be a reminder of the need for discernment and wisdom in dealing with opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is overseeing the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.
