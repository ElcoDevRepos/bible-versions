In the ancient Near Eastern context, servants were an integral part of household and community life, often responsible for various domestic and labor-intensive tasks. The large number of servants indicates the wealth and social structure of the returning community. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>, where God promises to bring His people back from captivity. The presence of both menservants and maidservants also underscores the patriarchal society of the time, where households were often large and included extended family and servants.<p><b>as well as their 245 male and female singers</b><br>The inclusion of singers among the returning exiles emphasizes the importance of worship and music in Israelite culture. Music played a crucial role in religious ceremonies and celebrations, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>, where David appoints singers for the Ark's procession. The presence of both male and female singers suggests a community committed to restoring the worship practices that were central to their identity. This also points to the prophetic vision of restored worship in passages like <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>, where the redeemed will return with singing. The singers can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of worship and praise, as He leads His people in perfect worship before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah who led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/menservants_and_maidservants.htm">Menservants and Maidservants</a></b><br>These individuals were part of the households of the returning exiles, indicating the social structure and economic conditions of the time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/singers.htm">Singers</a></b><br>The 245 men and women singers highlight the importance of worship and music in the community's spiritual life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, central to Jewish identity and worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return_from_exile.htm">The Return from Exile</a></b><br>This event marks the return of the Jewish people from Babylonian captivity, a significant moment of restoration and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_servants_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Servants in God's Plan</a></b><br>The inclusion of menservants and maidservants in the census reminds us that every person, regardless of social status, has a role in God's kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_worship.htm">The Importance of Worship</a></b><br>The presence of singers among the returnees highlights the centrality of worship in community life.
