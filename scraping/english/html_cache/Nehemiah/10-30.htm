Historically, intermarriage often led to the introduction of foreign gods and practices, which was a direct violation of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. This commitment echoes earlier commands found in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>, where God instructs Israel not to intermarry with the Canaanites to prevent turning away from Him. The context of Nehemiah is post-exilic, where the Israelites are re-establishing their identity and religious practices after returning from Babylonian captivity. The "people of the land" refers to the non-Israelite inhabitants of the region, who had different religious and cultural practices. This decision is part of a broader covenant renewal, emphasizing obedience to God's laws.<p><b>and we will not take their daughters for our sons</b><br>This part of the vow reinforces the commitment to avoid alliances that could lead to spiritual compromise. In the ancient Near Eastern context, marriages were often used to form political alliances and secure peace between different groups. However, for the Israelites, such alliances posed a threat to their distinct identity as God's chosen people. The prohibition against taking foreign wives is also seen in the reforms of Ezra, a contemporary of Nehemiah, who dealt with the issue of intermarriage in <a href="/ezra/9.htm">Ezra 9-10</a>. The concern was not ethnic purity but religious fidelity, as foreign wives could lead Israelite men to worship other gods, as seen in the example of Solomon in <a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>. This commitment to separation is a type of Christ's call for His followers to be in the world but not of it, maintaining spiritual distinctiveness while engaging with the broader culture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who returned from exile and were re-establishing their covenant relationship with God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples_of_the_land.htm">The Peoples of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the non-Israelite inhabitants of the region, often seen as a spiritual and cultural threat to the purity of Israel's worship and practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant_renewal.htm">The Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites recommitted themselves to God's laws, including the prohibition against intermarriage with surrounding nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the city whose walls Nehemiah helped to rebuild, symbolizing the restoration of the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_standards.htm">Commitment to God's Standards</a></b><br>The Israelites' pledge not to intermarry reflects a commitment to uphold God's standards and maintain spiritual purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_and_spiritual_distinction.htm">Cultural and Spiritual Distinction</a></b><br>The prohibition against intermarriage underscores the importance of maintaining a distinct cultural and spiritual identity as God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_compromise.htm">Guarding Against Compromise</a></b><br>This verse serves as a reminder to guard against compromises that can lead to spiritual decline.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_accountability.htm">Community Accountability</a></b><br>The communal nature of this pledge highlights the importance of accountability within the faith community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/relevance_for_today.htm">Relevance for Today</a></b><br>While the specific context of intermarriage may differ, the principle of aligning our closest relationships with those who share our faith remains relevant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Nehemiah_10_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Nehemiah 10:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_10_30_s_relevance_to_purity.htm">How does Nehemiah 10:30 emphasize the importance of maintaining spiritual purity today?

The people are not leaving obedience to chance; they are pledging an act of the will. Joshua called Israel to &#8220;choose this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), and Nehemiah&#8217;s generation echoes that spirit. Their vow flows from renewed covenant commitment after reading the Law (<a href="/bsb/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8&#8211;9</a>). Genuine revival always produces practical steps of obedience, not vague feelings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our daughters in marriage</b><p>Family life is the first arena where covenant loyalty is tested. Giving a daughter in marriage in ancient Israel was a solemn act involving lifelong alliances. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a> warned, &#8220;Do not intermarry with them&#8230;for they will turn your sons away from following Me.&#8221; By specifying daughters, the community addresses what they can directly control&#8212;parental consent. In a culture where marriages were arranged, this line underlines parental stewardship over the next generation&#8217;s faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the people of the land</b><p>This phrase describes the surrounding, ungodly nations inhabiting Judah after the exile. Ezra faced identical compromise a generation earlier (<a href="/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1&#8211;2</a>). &#8220;People of the land&#8221; were not merely foreigners; they were adherents of idolatry. <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15&#8211;16</a> had already linked intermarriage with eventual idol worship. The issue is spiritual purity, not ethnic superiority. By refusing such unions, the Jews guard the worship of the one true God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we will not take</b><p>The vow is reciprocal. It is not enough to refuse giving daughters; they also refuse taking pagan daughters. Obedience requires consistency on both sides of the marriage equation. <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> calls a double-minded person unstable; here, the community chooses single-minded devotion. They close every loophole that could dilute their faith through mixed marriages.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their daughters for our sons</b><p>Sons, future heads of households, must also remain within covenant boundaries. Solomon&#8217;s downfall vividly illustrated how &#8220;his wives turned his heart after other gods&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). Protecting sons from ungodly influences safeguards future leadership, worship, and national identity. <a href="/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a> asks, &#8220;And why one? He seeks godly offspring.&#8221; The goal is a lineage that glorifies God, free from idolatry&#8217;s snare.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/10-30.htm">Nehemiah 10:30</a> means the renewed community vows to preserve covenant faithfulness by refusing marriages that would link them to idolatry. They recognize parental responsibility, close every loophole, and aim for generations of godly offspring. The verse highlights that true revival shapes everyday decisions, especially in the home, ensuring worship remains pure and God&#8217;s people remain distinct in a hostile culture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That we would not give our daughters</span>, etc. On the recurrence of the mixed marriages so soon after the reformation of Ezra, see the comment on Nehemiah 13:23. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/10-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">We will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">give</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(nit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our daughters {in marriage}</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
