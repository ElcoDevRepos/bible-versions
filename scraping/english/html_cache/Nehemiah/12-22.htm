Eliashib was the high priest during Nehemiah's time, and his family played a significant role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls (<a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua succeeded him, marking a lineage of priestly leadership. This period spans the late 5th to early 4th century BC, a time of Persian rule over Judah. The mention of these priests underscores the continuity of religious leadership and the importance of maintaining the priestly lineage, which was crucial for the spiritual and social stability of the Jewish community.<p><b>during the reign of Darius the Persian</b><br>This refers to Darius II or Darius III, kings of Persia during the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC. The Persian Empire's control over Judah provided a relatively stable political environment, allowing the Jewish people to focus on religious and cultural restoration. The Persian kings, including Darius, are noted for their policies of tolerance towards different cultures and religions, which facilitated the rebuilding efforts in Jerusalem. This period is significant as it sets the stage for the eventual return of the Jewish exiles and the re-establishment of Jerusalem as a center of Jewish life.<p><b>the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded</b><br>The recording of the heads of the families signifies the importance of maintaining genealogical records for the Levites and priests. These records ensured the purity of the priestly line, which was essential for the proper conduct of temple services and rituals. The Levites and priests held critical roles in teaching the Law, leading worship, and performing sacrifices, which were central to Jewish religious life. This practice of recording genealogies is seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>) and underscores the emphasis on heritage and divine order in the community. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in preserving His people and their leaders through generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliashib.htm">Eliashib</a></b><br>A high priest during the time of Nehemiah, known for his role in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and his later controversial alliance with Tobiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joiada,_johanan,_and_jaddua.htm">Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua</a></b><br>Successive high priests following Eliashib, representing the continuity of the priestly line and the religious leadership in post-exilic Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/darius_the_persian.htm">Darius the Persian</a></b><br>Likely referring to Darius II or Darius III, Persian kings during whose reigns the Jewish community in Jerusalem continued to re-establish itself.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites_and_priests.htm">Levites and Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders responsible for temple worship and maintaining the spiritual life of the Jewish community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/recording_of_heads_of_families.htm">Recording of Heads of Families</a></b><br>This event signifies the importance of maintaining genealogical records for the Levites and priests, ensuring the purity and legitimacy of their service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_leadership_continuity.htm">The Importance of Leadership Continuity</a></b><br>The succession of high priests underscores the need for stable and faithful leadership in maintaining spiritual and communal integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_record-keeping_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Record-Keeping in God's Plan</a></b><br>Genealogical records were crucial for preserving the identity and purity of the priesthood, reflecting God's order and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_historical_context.htm">God's Sovereignty in Historical Context</a></b><br>The mention of Darius the Persian reminds us of God's control over world events and rulers, using them to fulfill His purposes for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>The Levites and priests serve as examples of dedication to God's service, encouraging us to remain faithful in our own callings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_spiritual_heritage.htm">The Significance of Spiritual Heritage</a></b><br>Understanding our spiritual heritage can inspire us to live out our faith with a sense of purpose and continuity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Nehemiah_12_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Nehemiah 12:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_12_22_Why_record_priests_lineages.htm">How does Nehemiah 12:22 highlight the importance of recording priestly lineage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Darius_s_role_in_Nehemiah_12_22.htm">What role did "the reign of Darius the Persian" play in Nehemiah 12:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ensure_accurate_church_records_today.htm">How can we ensure accurate spiritual records in our church communities today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_keep_records_of_faith_leaders.htm">Why is it important to maintain historical records of faith leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_12_22_and_God_s_faithfulness.htm">How does Nehemiah 12:22 connect with God's faithfulness throughout biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_12_22_and_priestly_lineage.htm">How does Nehemiah 12:22 confirm the historical accuracy of the priestly lineage during Darius's reign?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_12_22_s_view_on_genealogies.htm">What does Nehemiah 12:22 reveal about the importance of genealogies in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_12_22_and_Israel_s_leadership.htm">How does Nehemiah 12:22 support the continuity of religious leadership in Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_nehemiah_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Nehemiah 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/which_darius_is_in_nehemiah_12_22.htm">In Nehemiah 12:22, which Darius the Persian is mentioned, and how does this align with known Persian history?
