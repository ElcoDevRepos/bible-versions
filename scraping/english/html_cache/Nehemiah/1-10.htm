The term "servants" reflects their role in fulfilling God's purposes, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The Israelites are often referred to as God's people, highlighting their unique status among the nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). This relationship is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The concept of being God's people is further developed in the New Testament, where believers in Christ are described as a chosen people and a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>You redeemed them by Your great power and mighty hand.</b><br>The word "redeemed" signifies deliverance, often used in the context of liberation from slavery or oppression. This phrase recalls the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from Egyptian bondage through miraculous signs and wonders (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). The "great power and mighty hand" refer to God's sovereign ability to intervene in human history, demonstrating His authority over creation. This deliverance is a type of the ultimate redemption found in Jesus Christ, who redeems believers from sin and death (<a href="/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>). The imagery of God's mighty hand is also seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/26-8.htm">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>, reinforcing His role as a powerful deliverer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is the central figure in the book.
