These adversaries used intimidation as a tactic to halt the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. This reflects a common biblical theme where God's people face opposition when undertaking His work, as seen in the stories of Moses, David, and the early church in Acts. The enemies' strategy was psychological warfare, aiming to instill fear and doubt.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Their hands will be weakened in the work,</b><br>The phrase indicates the specific method of discouragement: predicting failure. In ancient Near Eastern culture, hands symbolize strength and capability. By targeting the workers' hands, the enemies aimed to undermine their physical and mental resolve. This tactic is reminiscent of the serpent's deception in Genesis, where doubt is sown to weaken faith and action.<p><b>and it will never be finished.&#8221;</b><br>The completion of the wall was crucial for the security and identity of Jerusalem. The enemies' assertion that the work would remain unfinished was not just a practical threat but also a spiritual one, challenging God's promises to restore His people. This echoes the doubts faced by the Israelites in the wilderness, questioning whether they would reach the Promised Land.<p><b>But now, my God, strengthen my hands.</b><br>Nehemiah's response is a prayer for divine empowerment, reflecting his reliance on God rather than human strength. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Nehemiah's prayer is an act of faith, invoking God's power to overcome human weakness, similar to Jesus' reliance on the Father during His earthly ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

In every case the real target is faith, because &#8220;without faith it is impossible to please God&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Fear distorts reality, but truth steadies the heart: &#8220;The LORD is my light and my salvation&#8212;whom shall I fear?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;saying, &#8216;Their hands will be weakened in the work&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The enemy&#8217;s prediction aimed to sap strength by suggestion&#8212;planting doubt that stamina and resolve would dry up (compare <a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; The wall work had already demanded extraordinary effort (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>); yet discouragement, not fatigue, posed the bigger threat.<p>&#8226; Paul later warned believers not to &#8220;grow weary in well-doing&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>). When the task is God-given, He supplies the endurance (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29&#8211;31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and it will never be finished.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The tactic escalates from undermining strength to denying completion, casting the entire mission as doomed (see <a href="/2_kings/18-29.htm">2 Kings 18:29&#8211;30</a> for Assyrian propaganda).<p>&#8226; The lie contradicts God&#8217;s earlier promise through Nehemiah&#8217;s burden and King Artaxerxes&#8217; favor (<a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7&#8211;8</a>).

The Apostle prayed similarly: &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Note the personal address&#8212;&#8220;my God&#8221;&#8212;a relationship that transforms fear into courage (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Opponents tried to paralyze God&#8217;s builders with fear, predicting weakened hands and an unfinished wall. Nehemiah answered not with arguments but with faith-anchored prayer, asking God to supply the strength human resolve lacked. The verse reminds us that every God-given task attracts intimidation, yet divine power sustains completion. When fear whispers &#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; faith replies, &#8220;My God can,&#8221; and the work moves forward to the glory of His name.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.</span>--The answer sent was that the thing was not true, and that the report itself did not exist. The reflection in Nehemiah's journal was that they sought to make him afraid. Quoting this, he adds the prayer that he recorded when he wrote it. It is one of those sudden, interjectional petitions which abound in the narrative, and is all the more remarkable from the absence of the words "O God," which are here inserted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They all made us afraid</span>. Rather, "<span class="accented">sought</span> to affright us." Their attempts did not succeed. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands</span>. "O God" is not in the original; whence some critics do not see in the words used a prayer, but only a statement - "But I now strengthened my hands" (so the Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions).
