It also reflects the intimate relationship between Nehemiah and God, emphasizing prayer and reliance on divine wisdom.<p><b>to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people</b><br>The gathering of these groups indicates a structured and hierarchical society in post-exilic Jerusalem. The nobles and officials were likely leaders and decision-makers, while "the people" refers to the general populace.

Much like <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>, where he testifies, &#8220;I had not told anyone what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem,&#8221; this phrase reminds us that restoration work begins with divine prompting. <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> echoes the same truth&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221; Even New Testament believers are moved &#8220;to will and to act&#8221; by God (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).

This reflects <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>, where Moses chose &#8220;capable men from all the people,&#8221; and underscores that covenant community is not a one-man project. <a href="/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1</a> lists heads of families traveling back to Jerusalem, showing precedent for corporate action. First Corinthians 12:12 affirms that the body functions when every member is present and active. Nehemiah&#8217;s assembly unites the community around God&#8217;s purpose, preventing fragmentation after the wall&#8217;s completion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be enrolled by genealogy</b><p>The point of the gathering was &#8220;to be enrolled by genealogy.&#8221; In <a href="/numbers/1-18.htm">Numbers 1:18</a> each tribe &#8220;declared their lineage,&#8221; establishing covenant identity through recorded ancestry. After exile, purity of the priesthood and clarity of inheritance mattered (<a href="/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59-63</a>). Genealogies were more than lists; they preserved the promises of God to Abraham&#8217;s descendants and anticipated the Messiah&#8217;s lineage (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>). <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a> reminds us that God still keeps books; being recorded in His register is of eternal significance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I found the genealogical register of those who had first returned</b><p>Nehemiah located an earlier list&#8212;virtually identical to <a href="/bsb/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>&#8212;confirming continuity between the first wave of exiles (circa 538 BC) and his generation (444 BC). Finding the document parallels <a href="/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>, where God &#8220;stirred up the spirit&#8221; of leaders to rebuild the temple, and fulfills <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>&#8217;s promise that exiles would return after seventy years. The discovery bolstered Nehemiah&#8217;s authority; he was not inventing requirements but building on God-ordained precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I found the following written in it</b><p>Like Hilkiah&#8217;s discovery of &#8220;the Book of the Law in the house of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>) or Jesus unrolling Isaiah&#8217;s scroll in <a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>, Nehemiah&#8217;s find underscores the reliability of written revelation. The record he is about to quote bears the stamp of divine preservation. By consulting the scroll, Nehemiah anchors present reforms in documented history, demonstrating that God&#8217;s purposes are consistent and written for all generations (<a href="/psalms/102-18.htm">Psalm 102:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a> highlights five timeless truths:<p>&#8226; God initiates kingdom work by moving hearts.<p>&#8226; The whole community&#8212;leaders and laity&#8212;must respond together.<p>&#8226; Clear identity rooted in God&#8217;s covenant matters for worship and witness.<p>&#8226; Present obedience connects with past faithfulness; Scripture preserves that link.<p>&#8226; Written records testify to God&#8217;s unchanging purposes and guide future generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5-73) The genealogical reckoning of the people, as the first step towards increasing the population of the metropolis, is determined on, not without express Divine suggestion; the allusion to this inspiration from God, is, as in <a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm" title="And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode on.">Nehemiah 2:12</a>, very emphatic. The original register of Zerubbabelis found and copied. The express language of both Ezra and Nehemiah makes it plain that this is no other than the list of those who came up with Zerubbabel and Joshua after the decree of Cyrus, in B.C. 538. Nehemiah's own census follows, in Nehemiah 11. The exposition, especially as compared with Ezra 2, has been given on that chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles</span>, etc. As Nehemiah contemplated the vast empty spaces within the city walls, and considered with himself how they might best be peopled, the thought came to him - and he hailed it as a Divine inspiration - that by taking a census of the people he might pave the way for some transfer of the inhabitants of the country districts into the capital, which would at any rate strengthen the latter, and lessen the desolate appearance of its streets and squares, which had so pained him. The census would show what proportion the country and town populations bore to each other, and would point out which were the places in the country districts that could best afford to lose a portion of their inhabitants. A census, therefore was resolved upon, and, according to ordinary Jewish usage (<a href="/numbers/1-17.htm">Numbers 1:17-47</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5, 6</a>; <a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-62</a>), it was genealogical. The tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi were numbered separately (<a href="/nehemiah/11-4.htm">Nehemiah 11:4-19</a>); and in the tribe of Judah the children of Pharez were reckoned apart from those of Zerah (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-4.htm">1 Chronicles 9:4, 6</a>). No doubt the genealogical principle was acted upon throughout, but further evidence upon the point is wanting. It would seem to have been in the course of his preparations for this census, perhaps in searching for precedents, that Nehemiah found the "register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first," which is the subject of the next section. <p> CHAPTER 7:6-73 THE REGISTER OF THOSE WHO RETURNED UNDER ZERUBBABEL, WITH THE NUMBER OF THEIR SLAVES, BEASTS, AND OBLATIONS (<a href="/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-73</a>). It is no doubt a curious circumstance that this list should occur twice, with no important differences, in the two Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Perhaps it was not in the original Ezra, that writer not having had the good fortune to "<span class="accented">find"</span> the document; but Nehemiah having "found" it and inserted it here, in connection with its discovery, a later arranger (Malachi?) removed it to the early part of Ezra, because it belonged to that portion of the Jewish history chronologically. The double record enables us to make out a more perfect catalogue than we could have obtained from either separately,-since there are corruptions in each which may be corrected by means of the other.
