Careful assessment is a mark of faith, not unbelief&#8212;just as Jesus advised counting the cost before building (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people</b><p>Having gathered the facts, Nehemiah rises to address every stratum of society. Leadership is public and inclusive, calling &#8220;the nobles, the officials, and the rest&#8221; to hear the same charge. Moses practiced a similar pattern by appointing leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens (<a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>).
