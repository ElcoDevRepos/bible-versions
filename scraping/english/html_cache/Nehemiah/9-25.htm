The fortified cities indicate the strength and preparedness of the Canaanite inhabitants, yet God delivered these cities into the hands of the Israelites, demonstrating His power and faithfulness. The fertile land signifies the abundance and prosperity of Canaan, often described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This conquest fulfills the promise made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>.<p><b>and took houses full of all goods</b><br>The Israelites inherited homes and possessions they did not labor for, illustrating God's provision and grace.

It underscores the theme of divine blessing and the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>wells already dug</b><br>Water was a precious resource in the ancient Near East, and wells were vital for survival. The mention of wells already dug highlights the completeness of God's provision, as the Israelites did not have to expend effort to secure this essential resource.

Vineyards and olive groves were significant for producing wine and oil, staples in the Israelite diet and economy. The abundance of fruit trees further emphasizes the richness of the land. This abundance is a tangible sign of God's blessing and favor, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>.<p><b>So they ate and were filled; they grew fat</b><br>This phrase indicates the satisfaction and prosperity experienced by the Israelites.
