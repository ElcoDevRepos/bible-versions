This response demonstrates Nehemiah's leadership and confidence in God's plan. His answer is direct and authoritative, reflecting his role as a leader appointed by God and the Persian king.<p><b>The God of heaven is the One who will grant us success</b><br>Nehemiah attributes success to God, emphasizing divine sovereignty and providence. This phrase reflects the biblical theme that true success comes from God (<a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>). It also highlights Nehemiah's faith and reliance on God rather than human strength or political alliances. The title "God of heaven" underscores God's supreme authority over all earthly matters.<p><b>We, His servants, will start rebuilding</b><br>Nehemiah identifies himself and the Jewish people as God's servants, indicating their dedication and commitment to God's work. This phrase shows the collective effort and unity among the Jews in rebuilding Jerusalem. It also reflects the biblical principle of serving God through action and obedience (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>but you have no portion, right, or claim in Jerusalem</b><br>Nehemiah asserts that the opponents have no legitimate stake in Jerusalem. This statement is rooted in the historical and covenantal context, where Jerusalem is the city chosen by God for His people (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). The phrase "portion, right, or claim" indicates legal and spiritual exclusion, emphasizing that the opponents are outside God's covenant community. This exclusion also foreshadows the New Testament theme of the church as the new Jerusalem, where only those in Christ have a rightful place (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who becomes a leader in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat,_tobiah,_and_geshem.htm">Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem</a></b><br>Opponents of Nehemiah who mock and attempt to thwart the rebuilding efforts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, whose walls Nehemiah is determined to rebuild to restore its former glory and protect its inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_heaven.htm">The God of Heaven</a></b><br>The sovereign deity whom Nehemiah invokes as the source of success and authority for the rebuilding project.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebuilding_of_jerusalem's_walls.htm">Rebuilding of Jerusalem's Walls</a></b><br>A significant event symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community and their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/confidence_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Confidence in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Nehemiah's response demonstrates unwavering faith in God's ability to bring success.

Together these truths encourage believers to trust God wholly, work diligently, and guard the mission uncompromisingly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">He will prosper us.</span>--The reply is a defiance in the name of the God of heaven. The closing words imply that, as in the days of Zerubbabel, the Samaritan enemies desired really to have their share in the undertaking. Nehemiah makes Zerubbabel's answer, but strengthens it; they had nothing in common with Jerusalem, not even a place in its memorials, save one of shame.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered I.</span> It is remarkable that Nehemiah takes no notice of the serious charge brought against him, does not say that he had the king's permission, but rather leaves the "<span class="accented">adversaries"</span> to suppose that he had not. Perhaps he thought that to reveal the truth would drive them to some desperate attempt, and therefore suppressed it<span class="cmt_word">. The God of heaven, he will prosper us</span>. Instead of a human, Nehemiah claims a Divine sanction for his proceedings. He and his brethren will build as <span class="accented">servants of the God of heaven.</span> Compare the answer made to Tatnai in Zerubbabel's time - "We are <span class="accented">the servants of the God of heaven</span> and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago" (<a href="/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</span> As the claim of the Samaritans to interfere in the affairs of the Jews had been disallowed when they came with an offer of aid (<a href="/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2, 3</a>), so now, when their interference is hostile in character, it is still more fiercely and indignantly rejected. They are told that they have no part in Jerusalem, no right, not even so much as a place in the recollections of the inhabitants. Their interference is officious, impertinent - what have they to do with Nehemiah, or the Israelites, or Jerusalem? Let them be content to manage the affairs of their own idolatrous community, and not trouble the worshippers of the true God. Nehemiah avoids opposition by concealment as long as he can; but when opposition nevertheless appears, he meets it with defiance. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/2-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I answered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
