This area included territories such as Syria, Phoenicia, and parts of modern-day Israel and Jordan. The governors were regional leaders appointed by the Persian king to maintain order and collect taxes. Nehemiah's visit underscores the administrative structure of the empire and the importance of securing local support for his mission to rebuild Jerusalem's walls. This journey also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to restore His people, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God speaks of using leaders to rebuild Jerusalem.<p><b>and gave them the king&#8217;s letters.</b><br>The king's letters were official documents granting Nehemiah authority and safe passage through the territories. These letters were crucial for legitimizing his mission and ensuring cooperation from the local governors. The use of written decrees was a common practice in the Persian Empire, as seen in the book of Esther (<a href="/esther/3-12.htm">Esther 3:12-13</a>), where royal edicts were used to communicate the king's commands. Nehemiah's reliance on these letters demonstrates the importance of legal and political backing in accomplishing God's work, reflecting the principle that divine missions often require human cooperation and resources.<p><b>The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.</b><br>The presence of army officers and cavalry indicates the king's strong support for Nehemiah's mission. This military escort not only provided protection but also signified the importance and official nature of Nehemiah's task. In the ancient Near East, such escorts were a sign of royal favor and authority, ensuring that Nehemiah's journey would be respected and unimpeded. This provision can be seen as a type of Christ, where divine protection and authority accompany those who are sent on God's mission. It also parallels the protection God promises to His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, where He commands His angels to guard His faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is granted permission to rebuild Jerusalem's walls.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/governors_of_the_region_beyond_the_river.htm">Governors of the region beyond the River</a></b><br>These are the local authorities in the Trans-Euphrates region, which Nehemiah must pass through to reach Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who authorizes Nehemiah's mission and provides him with letters of safe passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/army_officers_and_cavalry.htm">Army officers and cavalry</a></b><br>Military personnel sent by the king to ensure Nehemiah's safe travel, indicating the king's support and the importance of Nehemiah's mission.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_river.htm">The River</a></b><br>Refers to the Euphrates River, a significant geographical marker in the Persian Empire.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_secular_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Secular Affairs</a></b><br>Nehemiah's mission is a testament to God's control over political powers.

Enemies like Sanballat and Tobiah (<a href="/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>) now face royal authority behind the wall-builder.<p>&#8226; Yet the narrative later clarifies that ultimate security comes from the Lord, not from horses and chariots (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/4-14.htm">Nehemiah 4:14-20</a>).
