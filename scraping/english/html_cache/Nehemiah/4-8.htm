Historically, the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls under Nehemiah faced opposition from surrounding groups, including the Samaritans, Ammonites, Arabs, and Ashdodites. The term "conspired" suggests a secretive and deliberate plan, highlighting the intensity of the opposition. This reflects the broader biblical theme of opposition to God's work, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>to come and fight against Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the city of David, holds significant religious and political importance as the center of Jewish worship and identity. The enemies' intention to fight against Jerusalem underscores their desire to halt the restoration of the city, which symbolized the re-establishment of Jewish identity and worship. This opposition can be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, prefiguring the ultimate battle between good and evil. The physical attack on Jerusalem can be compared to spiritual attacks on believers, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces.<p><b>and create a hindrance</b><br>The goal of creating a hindrance was to stop the progress of rebuilding the walls, which were crucial for the protection and stability of Jerusalem. This reflects a common tactic of the enemy to disrupt God's plans and discourage His people. The hindrance can be seen as a metaphor for the obstacles believers face in their spiritual journey. Nehemiah's response to this threat, through prayer and strategic planning, serves as a model for overcoming opposition. This aligns with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, which encourages believers to resist the devil and stand firm in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
