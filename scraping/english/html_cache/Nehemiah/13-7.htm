After serving as governor and overseeing the rebuilding of the city's walls, he had returned to the Persian court. His journey back to Jerusalem highlights his commitment to the spiritual and physical restoration of the city. This return is reminiscent of other biblical figures who returned to places of significance, such as Moses returning to Egypt to lead the Israelites out of bondage. Jerusalem, as the center of Jewish worship and identity, holds a central place in biblical prophecy and eschatology, often symbolizing the future hope of God's people.<p><b>Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done</b><br>Eliashib, the high priest, was expected to uphold the sanctity of the temple and the laws of God. His actions, however, reveal a compromise with pagan influences, which was a recurring issue for Israel. This discovery by Nehemiah underscores the theme of vigilance against corruption and the need for reform. The term "evil" here is significant, as it denotes actions contrary to God's commands, echoing the warnings of the prophets against idolatry and unfaithfulness.<p><b>on behalf of Tobiah</b><br>Tobiah was an Ammonite official and a long-time adversary of Nehemiah. His presence in the temple precincts represents a direct violation of the law, which prohibited Ammonites and Moabites from entering the assembly of God (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>). This alliance between Eliashib and Tobiah illustrates the dangers of forming unholy alliances and the influence of external enemies within the community of faith. Tobiah's involvement is a reminder of the persistent opposition faced by those seeking to follow God's will.<p><b>by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.</b><br>The courts of the house of God were meant for worship and the activities of the Levites and priests. By allowing Tobiah to occupy a room there, Eliashib desecrated the sacred space, compromising its intended purpose. This act of defilement is reminiscent of the desecration of the temple by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, as prophesied in Daniel, and foreshadows the cleansing of the temple by Jesus Christ. It serves as a powerful reminder of the need to maintain the holiness of places dedicated to God and the importance of spiritual purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the city's walls and reform the community.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliashib.htm">Eliashib</a></b><br>The high priest who was responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the temple but compromised by allowing Tobiah, an Ammonite, to use a room in the temple courts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tobiah.htm">Tobiah</a></b><br>An Ammonite official and adversary of Nehemiah, who was given a room in the temple, contrary to the Law of Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city of the Jews, where the temple was located and where Nehemiah returned to enforce religious reforms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The sacred place of worship for the Israelites, which was defiled by the presence of Tobiah, an outsider and enemy of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_sanctity_of_worship.htm">Guarding the Sanctity of Worship</a></b><br>Just as Nehemiah took action to cleanse the temple, Christians are called to protect the purity of their worship and community from influences that contradict God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_accountability.htm">Leadership Accountability</a></b><br>Eliashib's failure as a leader serves as a warning that leaders must uphold God's standards and be vigilant against compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Allowing Tobiah into the temple illustrates how small compromises can lead to significant spiritual decline.
