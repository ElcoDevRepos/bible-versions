The Israelites, during their wilderness journey, were sustained by this bread-like substance that appeared each morning. Manna is often seen as a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "bread of life" in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>. This provision highlights God's faithfulness and care for His people, even in times of need. The manna also served as a test of obedience, as the Israelites were instructed to gather only what they needed for each day, except before the Sabbath.<p><b>in their thirst You brought them water from the rock.</b><br>This phrase recalls the events in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2-13</a>, where God provided water from a rock to quench the thirst of the Israelites. The rock is often seen as a symbol of Christ, as Paul explains in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where he states that the spiritual rock that followed them was Christ. This miraculous provision underscores God's ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations and serves as a reminder of His power and presence.<p><b>You told them to go in and possess the land</b><br>This phrase refers to God's command to the Israelites to enter and take possession of the Promised Land, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>. The land was a central part of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it represented a place of rest and blessing for the nation of Israel. The command to possess the land required faith and obedience, as the Israelites faced formidable enemies and challenges.<p><b>that You had sworn to give them.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenantal promise God made to the patriarchs, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18, and 26:3. God's oath to give the land to the descendants of Abraham was a foundational aspect of Israel's identity and history. The fulfillment of this promise was contingent upon Israel's faithfulness and obedience, yet it also demonstrated God's unwavering commitment to His word. The land promise is seen as a precursor to the ultimate rest and inheritance believers have in Christ, as described in <a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the provider and sustainer of the Israelites, fulfilling His promises and meeting their needs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from Egypt and sustained in the wilderness.

The Apostle points to the Savior, struck once for our salvation, from whom living water flows (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>).<p>&#8209; God&#8217;s patience is evident; He answered complaints with kindness, showing that grace is greater than grumbling.<p>&#8226; For readers, the phrase assures that no hardship&#8212;financial drought, emotional dryness, spiritual fatigue&#8212;is beyond His reach. If He can make rivers out of granite, He can refresh any soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You told them to go in and possess the land that You had sworn to give them</b><p>&#8226; The LORD&#8217;s oath began with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>) and was reiterated: &#8220;See, I have placed the land before you. Go in and possess it&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>). Nehemiah highlights God&#8217;s integrity&#8212;He not only promises; He commands entry.<p>&#8226; Key observations:<p>&#8209; The land is gift and responsibility. <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a> echoes both aspects: &#8220;I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread.&#8221;<p>&#8209; Failure to believe kept the first generation out (<a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13&#8211;14</a>).
