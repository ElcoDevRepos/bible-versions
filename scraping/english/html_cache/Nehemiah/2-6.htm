The queen's presence may have influenced the king's favorable response. This setting reflects the intimate and personal nature of the request, suggesting that Nehemiah had a trusted position. The king referred to here is Artaxerxes I, who reigned from 465-424 BC. The queen's identity is not specified, but her presence underscores the gravity of the situation. This moment highlights the providence of God in preparing the hearts of rulers to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord.<p><b>&#8220;How long will your journey take, and when will you return?&#8221;</b><br>The king's questions indicate his concern for Nehemiah's duties and responsibilities in the Persian court. This reflects the trust and value placed on Nehemiah as a cupbearer, a position of significant influence and responsibility. The inquiry about the duration of the journey and return shows the king's willingness to grant Nehemiah's request, provided it does not permanently remove him from his duties. This interaction demonstrates the balance between divine intervention and human planning, as Nehemiah had to provide a practical timeline for his mission. It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and accountability, as seen in <a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>, which emphasizes counting the cost before undertaking a task.<p><b>So it pleased the king to send me</b><br>The king's favorable decision is a testament to God's sovereignty and the power of prayer, as Nehemiah had previously prayed for success in his endeavor (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>). This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to work through earthly authorities to accomplish His will, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is established by God. The king's approval also signifies the divine favor that rested upon Nehemiah, reminiscent of the favor shown to Esther and Daniel in foreign courts. This moment marks the beginning of the fulfillment of God's plan to restore Jerusalem, aligning with the prophetic promises of restoration found in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>and I set a time</b><br>Nehemiah's ability to set a time for his journey indicates his careful planning and foresight. This reflects the biblical principle of wise planning and preparation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states that a man's heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps. Nehemiah's leadership qualities are evident in his ability to organize and execute a complex mission. The setting of a time also underscores the importance of accountability and commitment to one's word, as Nehemiah was responsible for fulfilling his promise to return. This phrase highlights the balance between faith and action, as Nehemiah trusted in God's provision while also taking practical steps to achieve his goals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is deeply concerned about the state of Jerusalem and its walls.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_artaxerxes.htm">King Artaxerxes</a></b><br>The Persian king who grants Nehemiah permission to return to Jerusalem to rebuild its walls.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen.htm">The Queen</a></b><br>Although not named, her presence indicates the importance of the moment and possibly her influence in the king's favorable decision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of Nehemiah's ancestors, whose walls are in ruins, prompting Nehemiah's request to the king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>Nehemiah's planned trip to Jerusalem to oversee the rebuilding of the city's walls.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor_and_timing.htm">Divine Favor and Timing</a></b><br>Recognize that God's timing is perfect, and He can move the hearts of leaders to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_leadership.htm">Courage in Leadership</a></b><br>Nehemiah's boldness in making his request teaches us to approach challenges with faith and courage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer.htm">The Role of Prayer</a></b><br>Nehemiah's success was preceded by prayer, reminding us of the importance of seeking God's guidance in our plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning.htm">Strategic Planning</a></b><br>Nehemiah set a time for his journey, demonstrating the value of planning and setting clear goals in our endeavors.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/influence_of_relationships.htm">Influence of Relationships</a></b><br>The presence of the queen suggests the importance of relationships and influence in achieving our objectives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Nehemiah_2_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Nehemiah 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_2_6_God_s_timing_in_plans.htm">How does Nehemiah 2:6 demonstrate God's timing in fulfilling His plans?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_prayer_affect_Nehemiah_s_king_talk.htm">What role does prayer play in Nehemiah's interaction with the king?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_2_6_Prov_21_1_God_s_guidance.htm">How does Nehemiah 2:6 connect with Proverbs 21:1 about God directing leaders' hearts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Nehemiah_s_king_approach.htm">What can we learn from Nehemiah's preparation before approaching the king?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Nehemiah_s_patience_in_leadership.htm">How can we apply Nehemiah's patience and faith in our own leadership roles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_king_approve_Nehemiah_s_wish.htm">Why did the king grant Nehemiah's request in Nehemiah 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_2_6_God_s_rule_in_events.htm">How does Nehemiah 2:6 demonstrate God's sovereignty in human affairs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_prayer_affect_Nehemiah_s_request.htm">What role does prayer play in Nehemiah's interaction with the king in Nehemiah 2:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_nehemiah_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Nehemiah 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_nehemiah_2_rarely_corroborated.htm">Why do other biblical or historical records rarely corroborate Nehemiah&#8217;s account of official support from the Persian Empire (Nehemiah 2)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_mention_the_queen_before_the_king.htm">Why does Nehemiah mention the queen&#8217;s presence before the king, given Persian court protocols at that time (Nehemiah 2:6)?
