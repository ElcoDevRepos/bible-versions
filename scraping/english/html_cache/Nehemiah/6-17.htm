The phrase "in those days" often indicates a specific period of time, suggesting ongoing challenges during the reconstruction. This period is marked by opposition and internal strife, reflecting the broader theme of perseverance in the face of adversity.<p><b>the nobles of Judah</b><br>The nobles were influential leaders within the community of Judah. Their involvement in correspondence with Tobiah highlights internal divisions and the complexity of leadership during the rebuilding process. Historically, the nobles often held significant power and could sway public opinion, which is crucial in understanding the dynamics at play.<p><b>sent many letters to Tobiah</b><br>Tobiah was an Ammonite official and one of Nehemiah's adversaries. The exchange of letters indicates a level of collusion or at least communication between the nobles and an external enemy. This reflects the political intrigue and the challenges Nehemiah faced not only from external threats but also from within his own ranks. The act of sending letters suggests a breach of loyalty and highlights the theme of betrayal.<p><b>and Tobiah&#8217;s letters kept coming to them</b><br>The continuous correspondence from Tobiah suggests persistent efforts to undermine Nehemiah's leadership and the rebuilding efforts. This ongoing communication could be seen as an attempt to influence or intimidate the nobles, reflecting the broader spiritual warfare theme present in the book. The persistence of Tobiah's letters underscores the relentless nature of opposition that God's people often face, drawing parallels to the New Testament's exhortations to remain vigilant against spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile.
