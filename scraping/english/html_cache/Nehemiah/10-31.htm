The "people of the land" refers to non-Israelites living in or around Judah, who did not observe the Sabbath. The Israelites' refusal to engage in commerce on the Sabbath underscores their dedication to keeping it holy, as prescribed in the Mosaic Law. This practice set them apart from surrounding nations and emphasized their covenant relationship with God. The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>), and observing it was a way to honor God and trust in His provision.<p><b>we will not buy from them on a Sabbath or holy day</b><br>This commitment reflects the broader principle of rest and worship on the Sabbath, extending to all forms of economic activity. By refraining from buying, the Israelites demonstrated their reliance on God rather than on economic transactions. This practice also served as a witness to the surrounding nations of Israel's distinct identity and devotion to God. The mention of "holy day" includes other significant religious festivals, such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles, which were also times of rest and spiritual reflection (Leviticus 23).<p><b>Every seventh year we will let the fields lie fallow</b><br>This practice is known as the Sabbatical year, commanded in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25:1-7</a>. Allowing the land to rest every seventh year was an act of faith, trusting God to provide enough in the sixth year to sustain them through the seventh. It also had practical benefits, such as restoring soil fertility. This agricultural sabbath mirrored the weekly Sabbath, reinforcing the rhythm of work and rest established by God. It was a reminder of God's sovereignty over the land and His provision for His people.<p><b>and will cancel every debt</b><br>The cancellation of debts every seventh year is part of the broader social and economic laws found in <a href="/deuteronomy/15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-11</a>. This practice was designed to prevent the accumulation of debt and the oppression of the poor, promoting social equality and compassion. It reflects God's concern for justice and mercy, ensuring that the community lived in harmony and that no one was permanently impoverished. This principle foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness of debts through Christ, who cancels the debt of sin for believers (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and reforming the community after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are recommitting to the covenant and making specific pledges to follow God's laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighboring_peoples.htm">Neighboring Peoples</a></b><br>Non-Israelite traders who would bring goods to sell to the Israelites, even on the Sabbath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath_day.htm">Sabbath Day</a></b><br>A holy day of rest instituted by God, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening, as a sign of the covenant between God and Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_year.htm">Seventh Year (Sabbatical Year)</a></b><br>A year of rest for the land, where no agricultural work was to be done, and debts were to be forgiven, as commanded in the Law of Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/honoring_the_sabbath.htm">Honoring the Sabbath</a></b><br>The commitment to not buy or sell on the Sabbath underscores the importance of setting aside time for rest and worship, prioritizing spiritual over economic gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Observing the Sabbatical year and canceling debts requires faith in God's provision, teaching us to rely on Him rather than our own efforts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_covenant.htm">Community and Covenant</a></b><br>The collective commitment of the Israelites to these practices highlights the importance of community accountability in spiritual growth and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/economic_justice_and_mercy.htm">Economic Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cancellation of debts every seven years reflects God's heart for justice and mercy, encouraging us to practice forgiveness and generosity in our financial dealings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_distinctiveness.htm">Cultural Distinctiveness</a></b><br>By adhering to these practices, the Israelites maintained their distinct identity as God's people, reminding us of the call to live counter-culturally in obedience to God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Nehemiah_10_31_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Nehemiah 10:31?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Nehemiah_10_31_s_Sabbath_guidance_today.htm">How does Nehemiah 10:31 guide us in honoring the Sabbath today?
