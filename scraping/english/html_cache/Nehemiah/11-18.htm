Their presence in Jerusalem, the "holy city," underscores the city's spiritual significance as the center of Jewish worship and governance. Jerusalem was considered holy because it housed the temple, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The Levites' role was crucial in maintaining the temple services, teaching the law, and leading worship, which highlights the importance of spiritual leadership in the community. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's chosen people being set apart for His purposes, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called a "kingdom of priests."<p><b>totaled 284</b><br>The specific number of Levites, 284, indicates a well-organized and structured community within Jerusalem. This number reflects the careful planning and dedication to reestablishing proper worship and religious order after the return from Babylonian exile. The detailed record-keeping seen here is consistent with other parts of Nehemiah, emphasizing the importance of accountability and stewardship in God's work. The number also suggests a significant, though not overwhelming, presence, indicating that while the Levites were essential, they were part of a larger community effort to restore Jerusalem. This can be compared to the detailed genealogies and census records found in books like Numbers and Chronicles, which underscore the importance of each individual's role in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and temple service.
