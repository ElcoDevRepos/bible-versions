His blessing of the LORD signifies a public acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and greatness. This act of blessing is a form of praise and thanksgiving, setting the tone for the communal worship that follows. The title "the great God" emphasizes God's supreme authority and power, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>). This moment occurs during the reading of the Law, a significant event in the post-exilic period, highlighting the restoration of religious practices after the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and with their hands uplifted</b><br>The lifting of hands is a common biblical gesture of prayer and worship, symbolizing openness, surrender, and a plea for divine intervention. This physical expression of worship is seen in various parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/63-4.htm">Psalm 63:4</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, indicating a posture of reverence and earnestness before God. It reflects the people's readiness to receive God's word and blessing.<p><b>all the people said, &#8220;Amen, Amen!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of "Amen" underscores the people's agreement and affirmation of the truths being proclaimed. "Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," and its use here signifies the congregation's collective assent to Ezra's blessing and the reading of the Law. This communal response is a powerful expression of unity and shared faith, reminiscent of similar affirmations in <a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>, where the Israelites confirm their commitment to God's covenant.<p><b>Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground</b><br>Bowing down with faces to the ground is an act of deep humility and submission, acknowledging God's holiness and majesty. This posture of worship is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> when Abraham falls facedown before God. It signifies reverence and awe, recognizing the LORD's authority and the people's unworthiness. This act of worship is a physical manifestation of the heart's attitude, aligning with the biblical principle that true worship involves both spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). The communal nature of this worship reflects the restored identity and unity of the Israelites as God's chosen people, renewed in their covenant relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who played a crucial role in the spiritual renewal of the Israelites.
