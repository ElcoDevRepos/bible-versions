Sanballat was the governor of Samaria, and Tobiah was an Ammonite official. Their opposition represents the broader resistance from surrounding regions to the restoration of Jerusalem, highlighting the political and social tensions of the time. This opposition can be seen as a reflection of the enmity between the Israelites and their neighbors, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Together with the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites</b><br>These groups represent the various peoples surrounding Judah. The Arabs were likely nomadic tribes from the desert regions, the Ammonites were descendants of Lot and traditional enemies of Israel, and the Ashdodites were Philistines from the coastal city of Ashdod. This coalition of adversaries underscores the widespread opposition to the Jewish community's efforts to reestablish itself. Historically, these groups had vested interests in keeping Jerusalem weak and vulnerable.<p><b>Heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing</b><br>The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls was a significant undertaking, symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community and their covenant with God. The progress of the repairs was a threat to the surrounding nations, as a fortified Jerusalem would be a political and military power. This phrase highlights the determination and resilience of the Jewish people under Nehemiah's leadership, despite external pressures.<p><b>And that the gaps were being closed</b><br>Closing the gaps in the walls was crucial for the security and defense of Jerusalem. It also symbolized the closing of spiritual and communal breaches among the Jewish people. The physical act of repairing the walls can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and unity. This effort reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to restore His people, as seen in prophecies like those in Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>They were furious</b><br>The anger of Sanballat, Tobiah, and their allies reflects the threat they perceived from a restored and fortified Jerusalem. Their fury can be seen as a manifestation of the spiritual warfare against God's plans and His people. This opposition is reminiscent of the broader biblical theme of the conflict between God's purposes and the forces that seek to thwart them. The hostility faced by Nehemiah and the Jews is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are warned of opposition in their spiritual journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sanballat.htm">Sanballat</a></b><br>A Samaritan leader who opposed Nehemiah's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem's walls.

For every believer, the lesson is clear: expect resistance, stay the course, and trust the Lord who empowers His people to finish well.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Were made up.</span>--Arose to the height before mentioned.<p><span class= "bld">Began to be stopped.</span>--The wall, they heard, was continuous. The tribes here enumerated were only small parties under the immediate influence of Sanballat: nothing beyond that would have been likely to occur among subjects in common of Persia.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah</span>, at Samaria, <span class="cmt_word">and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites</span>, in their respective residences, <span class="cmt_word">heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up</span>, or "that the (entire) wall of Jerusalem was of a (good) height," <span class="cmt_word">they were wroth</span>. Observe that Tobiah is here quite separated from the nation of the Ammonites, and in no way represented as their leader. Jealousy of Jerusalem on the part of the Ammonites and Philistines is quite natural; and, if the Arabs are the Edomites, their opposition would be equally a matter of course (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12</a>; <a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10, 14</a>); but the Edomites are not called Arabs in Scripture, nor do Arabs appear very often among the enemies of the Jews. It has been suggested that the "Arabians" here mentioned are the descendants of a colony which Sargon planted in Samaria itself. This, of course, is possible; but they may perhaps have been one of the desert tribes, induced to come forward by the hope of plunder (Ewald), and influenced by the Ammonites, their neighbours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;a&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
