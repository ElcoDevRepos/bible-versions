The mention of "one ox" and "six choice sheep" indicates a diet that was both substantial and varied, typical of a person in a high position. Oxen and sheep were common livestock in ancient Israel, used for both food and sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-10</a>). The inclusion of "some fowl" suggests additional variety and luxury, as birds were less commonly consumed. This provision underscores the wealth and resources available to Nehemiah as governor, yet also sets the stage for his restraint in not exploiting these resources.<p><b>and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided</b><br>Wine was a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, often safer to drink than water due to fermentation. The phrase "an abundance of all kinds of wine" suggests a variety of wines, indicating both wealth and the importance of hospitality in leadership. The ten-day interval may reflect a cultural or practical rhythm for restocking supplies. Wine is frequently mentioned in Scripture, symbolizing joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>) but also cautioning against excess (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). Nehemiah's provision of wine aligns with the cultural norms of his time, yet his moderation in consumption is implied.<p><b>But I did not demand the food allotted to the governor</b><br>Nehemiah's refusal to demand the governor's food allowance demonstrates his integrity and concern for the people. Governors were entitled to certain provisions, often at the expense of the local population. By not claiming these rights, Nehemiah sets an example of self-sacrifice and servant leadership, reminiscent of Christ's teaching in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> about serving rather than being served. This decision reflects a deep understanding of the burdens faced by the people and a commitment to justice and compassion.<p><b>because the burden on the people was so heavy</b><br>This phrase highlights the socio-economic context of Nehemiah's time. The people of Judah were under significant financial strain due to taxes and tributes imposed by the Persian Empire, as well as local economic challenges. Nehemiah's awareness of this burden and his decision to alleviate it by not taking his entitled provisions demonstrate his empathy and leadership. This concern for the oppressed echoes the prophetic calls for justice found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>, and prefigures the compassionate ministry of Jesus Christ, who came to lift the burdens of the oppressed (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah was the governor of Judah and a key leader in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

He offers plentiful, top-quality food and periodic wine at his own expense, willingly forfeiting the official allowance to spare an already burdened people. The verse models servant leadership: rights surrendered for the good of others, resources stewarded for God&#8217;s glory, and compassion guiding every decision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Once in ten clays store of all sorts of wine</span>.

The bondage intended must be that under the Persian crown, since neither the labour at the wall nor the oppression of the creditors lasted during the twelve years that Nehemiah was governor.
