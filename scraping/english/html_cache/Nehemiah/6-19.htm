Their allegiance to Tobiah, an Ammonite official, highlights the political and social complexities Nehemiah faced. Tobiah's connection to the Jewish nobles was likely strengthened through marriage alliances, as Tobiah was related to Eliashib the high priest (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>). This phrase underscores the internal opposition Nehemiah encountered, as these nobles were more loyal to Tobiah than to Nehemiah's mission. The reporting of Tobiah's "good deeds" suggests an attempt to sway Nehemiah's opinion or undermine his authority by presenting Tobiah in a favorable light, despite his opposition to the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.<p><b>and they relayed my words to him</b><br>This indicates a breach of trust and confidentiality, as the nobles were acting as informants for Tobiah. Nehemiah's words, likely concerning the rebuilding efforts and strategies, were being communicated to an adversary. This betrayal highlights the challenges of leadership and the need for discernment and wisdom in dealing with internal threats. It also reflects the broader theme of spiritual warfare, where opposition can come from unexpected sources within one's own community.<p><b>And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me</b><br>Tobiah's use of letters to intimidate Nehemiah is a tactic of psychological warfare, aiming to instill fear and discourage the work on the wall. This method of intimidation is consistent with other forms of opposition Nehemiah faced, such as mockery and threats (<a href="/nehemiah/4.htm">Nehemiah 4:1-3, 4</a>:7-8). The letters represent a direct challenge to Nehemiah's leadership and the divine mission to restore Jerusalem. This scenario echoes the broader biblical theme of God's people facing opposition when fulfilling His purposes, as seen in the stories of Moses, David, and the early church. Nehemiah's response to such intimidation is a model of steadfast faith and reliance on God, as he continually sought divine guidance and strength in prayer (<a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

Their steady flow of compliments about him was meant to soften Nehemiah&#8217;s view of an enemy of the work.<p>&#8226; Flattery is a well-known tool of manipulation (<a href="/proverbs/29-5.htm">Proverbs 29:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-3</a>). By praising Tobiah&#8217;s &#8220;good deeds,&#8221; the nobles disguised the reality that he was opposing God&#8217;s rebuilding project (<a href="/nehemiah/2-19.htm">Nehemiah 2:19</a>; 4:7-8).<p>&#8226; The incident warns believers to discern between genuine fruit and a polished reputation (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15-20</a>).

Compromise always erodes loyalty (<a href="/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah&#8217;s leadership was being undercut from within, echoing earlier betrayals in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/judges/16-18.htm">Judges 16:18-20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Nehemiah did not abandon transparency; he kept leading openly while trusting God to expose hidden schemes (<a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me</b><p>&#8226; When flattery and espionage didn&#8217;t derail the work, Tobiah resorted to threatening letters, just as Sennacherib once wrote intimidating messages to King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9-14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern is familiar: God&#8217;s enemies try deception first, intimidation next (<a href="/nehemiah/4-8.htm">Nehemiah 4:8-11</a>; <a href="/acts/4-17.htm">Acts 4:17-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah responded by steadfast prayer and continued building (<a href="/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9</a>). Spiritual courage resists fear tactics because &#8220;God has not given us a spirit of fear&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/6-19.htm">Nehemiah 6:19</a> exposes three coordinated attacks: flattering words, information leaks, and threatening letters. Each strategy aimed to weaken Nehemiah&#8217;s resolve and stall God&#8217;s rebuilding plan. By discerning the true nature of &#8220;good deeds,&#8221; guarding his speech without retreating, and refusing to be intimidated, Nehemiah models how believers can stay faithful when opposition arises from both outside and inside the community.
