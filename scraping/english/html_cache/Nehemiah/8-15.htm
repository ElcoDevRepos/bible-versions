In the context of Nehemiah, this proclamation is a call to obedience and remembrance of God's laws. The public nature of the proclamation emphasizes the communal aspect of worship and obedience, reflecting the practices seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>, where the law is read aloud to the people.<p><b>and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem</b><br>The spreading of the message throughout the towns and in Jerusalem highlights the importance of unity and collective participation among the Israelites. Jerusalem, being the spiritual and political center, serves as the focal point for religious observance. This mirrors the centrality of Jerusalem in other significant events, such as the Passover celebrations (<a href="/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30:1-5</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8220;Go out to the hill country</b><br>The hill country refers to the elevated regions surrounding Jerusalem, known for their natural resources. This area is historically significant, as it was part of the land promised to the Israelites (<a href="/joshua/11-16.htm">Joshua 11:16</a>). The command to go out signifies an active participation in the observance of the Feast of Tabernacles, a reminder of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<p><b>and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees</b><br>The specific mention of these branches is tied to the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>), where these materials were used to construct temporary shelters or booths. Each type of branch has symbolic meaning, representing the diversity and richness of God's creation. The use of these natural elements underscores the connection between the Israelites and the land God provided.<p><b>to make booths</b><br>The making of booths, or sukkot, is a direct command from <a href="/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42-43</a>, serving as a physical reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God during their 40 years in the wilderness. This practice is a type of Christ, as it foreshadows the temporary nature of earthly life and the ultimate rest found in Jesus (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>as it is written</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority of Scripture and the importance of adhering to God's commands as recorded in the Torah. It reflects the principle of sola scriptura, emphasizing that practices and beliefs should be grounded in the written Word of God. This adherence to Scripture is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, as seen in Jesus' own use of "it is written" during His temptations (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who led the public reading of the Law, which inspired the people to observe the Feast of Booths.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of Jewish worship and the location where the people gathered to hear the Law and celebrate the feast.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country.htm">Hill Country</a></b><br>The surrounding region from which the people were instructed to gather branches for constructing booths.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_booths.htm">Feast of Booths (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' wilderness journey, during which they lived in temporary shelters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>The people's response to Ezra's reading of the Law demonstrates the importance of aligning our actions with Scripture.

But it is better to adopt Houbigant's slight emendation of the text, which thus runs: "And when they heard it, they proclaimed," &c. The command, then, is to go out to the Mount of Olives, and gather, not precisely the branches which the ancient law required, but such as circumstances allowed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that they should publish</span>. See <a href="/leviticus/23-4.htm">Leviticus 23:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saying,</span> <span class="cmt_word">Go forth</span>, etc. These words are not found in any existing Scripture, and some corruption of the present text may therefore be suspected. The Septuagint interposes, between "Jerusalem" and "Go forth," the words "And Esdras said," which would remove the difficulty; but it is difficult to understand how Ezra's name should have fallen out. Perhaps Houbigant is right in his suggestion of an emendation, by which the verse would run thus: - "And when they heard it, they proclaimed in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth," etc. Into the mountain. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the neighbouring mountain, the Mount of Olives. <span class="cmt_word">Pine branches</span>.

The same expression is used in <a href="/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, the meaning in each place being uncertain. Perhaps trees with thick, viscous leaves are intended. It is remark- able that two of the trees commanded in Leviticus are omitted, viz., the hadar and the "willow of the brook," while three not mentioned in Leviticus - the olive, oleaster, and myrtle - are added. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they proclaimed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#353;&#183;m&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this message</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6963.htm">Strong's 6963: </a> </span><span class="str2">A voice, sound</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and spread [it]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
