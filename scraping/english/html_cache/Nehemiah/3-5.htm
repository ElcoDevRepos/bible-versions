Tekoa is mentioned in other parts of the Bible, such as in the story of the wise woman from Tekoa in <a href="/2_samuel/14.htm">2 Samuel 14</a>. The Tekoites' involvement in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls demonstrates their commitment to the restoration of the city, despite the distance from their hometown. This reflects a broader theme of unity and cooperation among the Israelites during Nehemiah's leadership. The phrase "made repairs" indicates active participation and dedication to the communal effort, a recurring theme in the book of Nehemiah.<p><b>but their nobles did not put their shoulders to the work</b><br>The mention of the nobles' reluctance highlights a contrast between the common people and their leaders. This phrase suggests a lack of humility or willingness to serve among the Tekoite nobles, which can be seen as a failure to fulfill their leadership responsibilities. This reluctance may have been due to pride, a sense of superiority, or political reasons. The phrase "did not put their shoulders to the work" implies a refusal to engage in the physical labor required, which is a metaphor for not supporting the collective mission. This can be compared to other biblical instances where leaders failed to act, such as in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where the servant who did not invest his talent was reprimanded.<p><b>under their supervisors</b><br>The term "supervisors" refers to those who were appointed to oversee the construction work. This structure of leadership and accountability was crucial for the successful completion of the wall. The presence of supervisors indicates an organized approach to the rebuilding effort, with clear lines of authority and responsibility. This mirrors the biblical principle of orderly conduct and submission to authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, which emphasizes the importance of respecting governing authorities. The failure of the nobles to work under their supervisors can be seen as a disregard for this principle, highlighting the importance of humility and cooperation in achieving God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tekoites.htm">Tekoites</a></b><br>The people from Tekoa, a town in Judah.

The ordinary people of the place, however, did double duty. (See <a href="/nehemiah/3-27.htm" title="After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lies out, even to the wall of Ophel.">Nehemiah 3:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Tekoites</span> are the people of Tekoah, whence came the "wise woman" whom Joab sent to incline David to fetch home Absalom (<a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2, 3</a>). It was a small place, and does not appear, either in the catalogue of those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="/ezra/2-20.htm">Ezra 2:20-35</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25-38</a>), or in the census list of Nehemiah (<a href="/nehemiah/11-25.htm">Nehemiah 11:25-35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their nobles put not their necks to the work</span>. This imputation of blame has been thought out of harmony with the general narrative contained in the chapter, and various emendations have been proposed to remove the so-called difficulty. But it has really first to be shown that a difficulty exists. Surely it would have been more strange if there had been no opposition to Nehemiah's wishes - no withdrawal from the work, than if there were the amount of opposition that is recorded. And supposing opposition to be made, why should Nehemiah not notice it? In music, the force and value of harmonious notes is brought out by an occasional discord. A desire to do honour to those who deserved it would be quite compatible with a determination to brand with disgrace the undeserving. And the contrast would enhance the value of the praise. Thus, there is no reason for disturbing the existing text, nor for questioning its plain meaning. The upper classes at Tekoah, the <span class="accented">adirim</span> or "exalted, withdrew from the work, like oxen withdrawing their necks from the yoke, and stood aloof, leaving it to the common people to engage in it, or not, as they pleased. The common people were perhaps moved to the greater zeal by the defection of their natural leaders. They were among those who accomplished a double task, repairing a second portion of the wall (ver. 27) after having finished their first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Next</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
