Lending money and grain was a common practice in ancient Israel, especially during times of economic hardship. The Law of Moses allowed lending but prohibited charging interest to fellow Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>). Nehemiah's mention of his brothers and servants indicates a collective responsibility among the leaders and those in authority. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where family and household units were integral to social and economic structures. The practice of lending grain is significant, as grain was a staple food and a form of currency in the ancient Near East, highlighting the severity of the famine and economic distress faced by the people (<a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3</a>).<p><b>Please, let us stop this usury.</b><br>Nehemiah calls for an end to usury, which is the practice of charging excessive interest on loans. This plea aligns with the biblical injunctions against usury among Israelites, emphasizing justice and compassion (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>). The historical context reveals that returning exiles faced economic challenges, including rebuilding efforts and external threats, which exacerbated financial burdens. Nehemiah's appeal is a call to return to covenantal faithfulness and social justice, reflecting the prophetic tradition that condemns exploitation and advocates for the poor (<a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6-7</a>, <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>). This moment foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized mercy, generosity, and the care for the needy (<a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-36</a>). Nehemiah's leadership here is a type of Christ, demonstrating sacrificial concern for the well-being of others and a commitment to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes.
