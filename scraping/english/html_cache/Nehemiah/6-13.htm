The hiring of individuals to intimidate Nehemiah reflects the persistent efforts of adversaries like Sanballat and Tobiah to thwart the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. This tactic of intimidation is a common theme in biblical narratives, where God's people often face opposition from those who seek to undermine God's work (e.g., <a href="/daniel/6-4.htm">Daniel 6:4-5</a>). The use of hired agents suggests a calculated and organized effort to disrupt Nehemiah's mission.<p><b>so that I would sin by doing as he suggested</b><br>The suggestion here was likely to lure Nehemiah into the temple under false pretenses, which would have been a sin for him as a layperson (<a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>). This reflects the enemy's strategy to lead God's servants into sin, thereby discrediting their leadership and mission. The temptation to sin is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the temptations of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where the enemy seeks to derail God's plan through deceit.<p><b>so they could give me a bad name</b><br>A bad name or reputation would undermine Nehemiah's authority and leadership. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a leader's reputation was crucial for maintaining influence and support. <a href="/proverbs/22.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a> emphasizes the value of a good name, indicating its importance in biblical culture. The enemies' goal was to tarnish Nehemiah's reputation, thereby weakening his ability to lead and complete the work God had called him to do.<p><b>in order to discredit me</b><br>Discrediting Nehemiah would have broader implications for the community and the work of rebuilding Jerusalem. The enemies' ultimate aim was to stop the work of God by discrediting His chosen leader. This reflects a broader spiritual battle, where the forces of evil seek to discredit and destroy the work of God (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). Nehemiah's discernment and reliance on God highlight the importance of spiritual vigilance and integrity in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is dedicated to rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
