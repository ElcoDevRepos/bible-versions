Nighttime travel would have minimized attention and potential opposition from those who might resist his plans. This reflects the wisdom often associated with leaders in Scripture, such as David's strategic movements (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7</a>). The "few men" accompanying him suggests a trusted group, emphasizing the importance of wise counsel and fellowship, akin to Jesus choosing His disciples (<a href="/mark/3-13.htm">Mark 3:13-14</a>).<p><b>I did not tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem.</b><br>Nehemiah's silence about his mission underscores the importance of discretion and divine guidance. His reliance on what "my God had laid on my heart" highlights a personal and intimate relationship with God, reminiscent of the prophets who received direct revelation (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>). This phrase also points to the theme of divine calling and purpose, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Paul (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>).<p><b>The only animal with me was the one on which I was riding.</b><br>The mention of a single animal, likely a donkey or mule, suggests humility and practicality. This detail contrasts with the grandeur of royal processions, aligning Nehemiah with the humble yet determined leaders in Scripture. It also foreshadows Christ's entry into Jerusalem on a donkey (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>), symbolizing peace and fulfillment of prophecy. The simplicity of Nehemiah's approach reflects a focus on mission over material display, a principle echoed in Jesus' teachings on humility and service (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is deeply concerned about the welfare of Jerusalem and its people.
