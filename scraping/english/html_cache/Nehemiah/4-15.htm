The enemies' scheme was to attack and create confusion among the builders. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where God's people often face opposition from adversaries. The awareness of the scheme suggests vigilance and discernment, qualities encouraged throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p><b>and that God had frustrated it</b><br>The frustration of the enemies' plans is attributed to divine intervention. This demonstrates God's sovereignty and protection over His people, a recurring theme in the Bible. It echoes the assurance found in passages like <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>, where God thwarts the plans of nations. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of God over evil, as seen in the life and work of Jesus Christ, who overcame the schemes of Satan (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>each of us returned to his own work on the wall</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unity and dedication of the Israelites in rebuilding Jerusalem's wall. Despite opposition, they resumed their work, reflecting the biblical principle of perseverance in the face of trials (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>). The wall's reconstruction was crucial for the security and identity of Jerusalem, symbolizing restoration and renewal. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who restores and rebuilds the spiritual lives of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.
