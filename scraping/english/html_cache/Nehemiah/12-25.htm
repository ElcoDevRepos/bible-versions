The mention of these specific names highlights the importance of each individual's role in the community. In the context of Nehemiah, these men were part of the post-exilic community that returned to Jerusalem to restore the city and its temple. The listing of names signifies the importance of each person's contribution to the collective effort of rebuilding and maintaining the spiritual and physical integrity of Jerusalem. The names themselves are Hebrew, with meanings that often reflect attributes of God or aspects of faith, which was common in Israelite culture.<p><b>were gatekeepers</b><br>Gatekeepers held a significant role in ancient Israel, responsible for the security and order of the temple and city gates. Their duties were not merely physical but also spiritual, as they ensured that only those who were ceremonially clean could enter the sacred spaces. This role is reminiscent of the cherubim guarding the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), symbolizing the protection of holy places. Gatekeepers were often Levites, emphasizing the connection between worship and daily life, as they maintained the sanctity of the temple.<p><b>who guarded the storerooms</b><br>Storerooms in the temple complex were used to store offerings, tithes, and other contributions from the people. These storerooms were crucial for the sustenance of the Levites and priests, as well as for the maintenance of temple services. The guarding of these storerooms was a task of great responsibility, ensuring that the resources dedicated to God were protected and used appropriately. This duty reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where God's people are called to manage His provisions wisely.<p><b>at the gates</b><br>The gates of a city in ancient times were not only entry points but also places of judgment, commerce, and social interaction. In Jerusalem, the gates were particularly significant as they were the first line of defense and a symbol of the city's strength and integrity. The positioning of gatekeepers at the gates underscores the importance of vigilance and readiness in protecting the community. Biblically, gates often represent places of decision and transition, as seen in passages like <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>, where legal matters were settled at the city gate. The role of gatekeepers at the gates thus carries both practical and symbolic weight, emphasizing the need for spiritual and physical guardianship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mattaniah.htm">Mattaniah</a></b><br>- A Levite involved in the temple service, specifically in the role of a gatekeeper.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bakbukiah.htm">Bakbukiah</a></b><br>- Another Levite serving as a gatekeeper, highlighting the importance of this role in maintaining the sanctity and order of the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>- A Levite gatekeeper, contributing to the collective effort of guarding the temple storerooms.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/meshullam.htm">Meshullam</a></b><br>- A gatekeeper, part of the team responsible for the security and management of temple resources.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/talmon_and_akkub.htm">Talmon and Akkub</a></b><br>- Both served as gatekeepers, emphasizing the collaborative nature of temple service.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/s/storerooms_at_the_gates.htm">Storerooms at the gates</a></b><br>- These were critical areas within the temple complex where offerings and supplies were stored, requiring diligent oversight.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithful_service.htm">The Importance of Faithful Service</a></b><br>The role of gatekeepers, though seemingly mundane, was crucial for the functioning and sanctity of the temple.

In every age, God still looks for people willing to sing His praise, sign His covenants, and stand their post with unwavering devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">At the thresholds.</span>--<span class= "ital">At the treasuries,</span> or <span class= "ital">store-chambers</span> attached to the several gates of the Temple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Obadiah</span> are new as Levitical names; but the remaining names of the passage are well known. <span class="cmt_word">Talmon and Akkub</span> are among the porters of David's time (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>), and are mentioned in <a href="/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/7-45.htm">Nehemiah 7:45</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Bakbukiah and Mattaniah</span> occur in <a href="/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a> and Nehemiah 12:8, 9; but as families of singers, rather than of porters, in those places. <span class="cmt_word">Keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates</span>.

DEDICATION OF THE WALL OF JERUSALEM UNDER NEHEMIAH AND EZRA, WITH NEHEMIAH'S ARRANGEMENT OF THE TEMPLE OFFICERS, AND HIS EFFORTS FOR THE REFORM OF RELIGION (CH. 12:27-47, AND CH. 13.). DEDICATION OF THE WALL (<a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>). It is supposed by some that the author has here departed from the chronological order, and gone back to a date not much subsequent to the completion of the wall in September, <span class="date">B.C. 444</span>, since the dedication of a work under ordinary circumstances follows closely upon its accomplishment. But no reason has been shown for the actual place held by the narrative in the Book upon this supposition, nor is it easy to imagine that the author would have separated the dedication of the wall from its completion by five chapters and a half, unless they had been separated in fact by an interval of some duration. The interval seems, by the notes of time contained in chs. 12, 13, to have been one of nearly thirteen <span class="accented">years.</span> Nehemiah's religious reforms were certainly subsequent to the visit that he paid to the Persian court in <span class="date">B.C. 432</span> (<a href="/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>). These reforms grew out of a reading of the law which took place at the time when Nehemiah appointed the temple officers (<a href="/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1</a>), and that appointment followed closely on the dedication (<a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>). We may account for the long delay by supposing that Nehemiah was afraid of offending Artaxerxes if he ventured on a ceremony, to which the superstition of the surrounding heathen may have attached extreme importance, without his express permission, and that to obtain this permission his personal influence was necessary. The dedication of a city wall was, so far as we know, a new thing in Israel; but it had been customary from a remote time to dedicate houses (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>); and natural piety extended this practice to aggregations of houses, and to the limit or fence by which they were practically made one. The priestly order had shown its sense of the fitness of such a consecration when they raised their portion of the wall, and had at once "sanctified it" (<a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>). Nehemiah now, by the ceremony which he planned and carried out, placed the whole circuit of the wall under the Divine protection, confessing in this solemn act the intrinsic worthlessness of mere walls and bulwarks, unless God lends them strength and makes them a protection against enemies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Mattaniah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mat&#183;tan&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4983.htm">Strong's 4983: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mattaniah -- 'gift of Yah', the last king of Judah, also a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Bakbukiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1467;&#1469;&#1511;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;buq&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
