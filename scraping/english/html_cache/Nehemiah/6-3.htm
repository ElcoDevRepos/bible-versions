By sending messengers, he maintains a level of diplomacy and avoids direct confrontation, which could lead to unnecessary conflict. This approach reflects the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." Nehemiah's leadership style is characterized by discernment and prudence, qualities essential for effective governance and conflict resolution.<p><b>&#8220;I am doing a great work</b><br>Nehemiah recognizes the significance of his mission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. This "great work" is not just a construction project but a divine mandate to restore the city and its people. The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls symbolizes the restoration of God's covenant with Israel, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>, which speaks of rebuilding ancient ruins and raising up age-old foundations. Nehemiah's commitment to this task reflects the importance of prioritizing God's work above personal or political agendas.<p><b>and cannot come down.</b><br>Nehemiah's refusal to leave his work demonstrates his unwavering dedication and focus. This phrase highlights the importance of perseverance in the face of distraction and opposition. In the New Testament, Jesus exemplifies this same determination in <a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>, where He resolutely sets out for Jerusalem despite knowing the challenges ahead. Nehemiah's steadfastness serves as a model for believers to remain committed to their God-given missions.<p><b>Why should the work stop</b><br>Nehemiah's rhetorical question underscores the critical nature of the task at hand. Stopping the work would not only delay the project but also potentially demoralize the people and give the enemies an opportunity to thwart their efforts. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might." Nehemiah's question challenges the notion of abandoning God's work for lesser pursuits.<p><b>while I leave it to go down to you?&#8221;</b><br>Nehemiah's decision to not "go down" to his adversaries signifies his refusal to be drawn into their schemes. The phrase "go down" can also imply a descent into compromise or distraction. This mirrors the temptation of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>, where He refuses to be diverted from His mission by Satan's offers. Nehemiah's resolve to stay focused on his divine assignment serves as an example of prioritizing God's calling over worldly distractions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah is the governor of Judah and the leader of the effort to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
