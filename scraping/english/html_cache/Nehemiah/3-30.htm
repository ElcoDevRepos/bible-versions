Hananiah and Hanun are mentioned as working together, which reflects the unity among the Israelites during this period. The mention of "another section" indicates the systematic approach to the reconstruction, with different groups assigned specific portions of the wall. This method ensured efficiency and accountability. The genealogical details, such as "son of Shelemiah" and "sixth son of Zalaph," underscore the importance of family lineage and heritage in Jewish culture, often serving as a means of establishing identity and credibility. The involvement of multiple family members in the work signifies a collective commitment to the restoration of their city, which was both a physical and spiritual endeavor.<p><b>Next to them, Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his own quarters.</b><br>Meshullam's work "opposite his own quarters" suggests a personal investment in the project, as he was directly responsible for the area near his residence. This personal stake likely motivated him to ensure the quality and durability of the repairs. The phrase highlights the practical strategy of assigning work to those who would benefit directly from the security and stability of the wall. Meshullam's mention in other parts of Nehemiah (e.g., <a href="/nehemiah/6-18.htm">Nehemiah 6:18</a>) indicates his active role in the community and possibly his influence or leadership. The focus on individual contributions within the larger communal effort reflects the biblical theme of the body of Christ, where each member plays a vital role in the health and function of the whole (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>). This passage also serves as a reminder of the importance of stewardship and responsibility in one's immediate environment, a principle that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hananiah_son_of_shelemiah.htm">Hananiah son of Shelemiah</a></b><br>A worker involved in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall, demonstrating dedication to the communal effort.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanun,_the_sixth_son_of_zalaph.htm">Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph</a></b><br>Another individual contributing to the wall's repair, highlighting the collective responsibility of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/meshullam_son_of_berechiah.htm">Meshullam son of Berechiah</a></b><br>He repaired the section opposite his own quarters, indicating personal investment in the project.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem's_wall.htm">Jerusalem's Wall</a></b><br>The central focus of Nehemiah's mission, representing the restoration of the city's physical and spiritual integrity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebuilding_effort.htm">Rebuilding Effort</a></b><br>A significant event in Jewish history, symbolizing renewal and faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/community_involvement.htm">Community Involvement</a></b><br>The rebuilding of the wall was a communal effort, emphasizing the importance of working together in the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_investment.htm">Personal Investment</a></b><br>Like Meshullam, who repaired the section opposite his own quarters, believers should take personal responsibility for the areas of ministry closest to them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_adversity.htm">Perseverance in Adversity</a></b><br>The builders faced opposition, yet they persevered.

But, as general superintendent of the whole (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-23</a>), he could scarcely take any special work; and the argument that might have been founded upon a single occurrence of the expression "after me" is deprived of all force by its double occurrence, here and in ver. 31. <span class="cmt_word">Another piece</span>.
