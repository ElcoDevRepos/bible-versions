The high priest held significant religious authority in Israel, responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the temple and the purity of worship. This connection highlights the gravity of the situation, as it involves the priestly lineage, which was expected to uphold the highest standards of religious and cultural integrity. The involvement of Eliashib's family in compromising alliances reflects a broader issue of spiritual and cultural decline among the leadership.<p><b>had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite</b><br>Sanballat was a known adversary of Nehemiah, opposing the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls. He was a Samaritan leader, and the term "Horonite" likely refers to his origin from Horonaim in Moab. This marriage alliance with Sanballat represents a significant breach of Israelite law, which prohibited intermarriage with foreign nations that could lead to idolatry and cultural assimilation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). Such alliances were seen as threats to the religious purity and identity of the Jewish people, as they often led to the introduction of foreign gods and practices.<p><b>Therefore I drove him away from me</b><br>Nehemiah's response was decisive and uncompromising. By driving away the son-in-law, Nehemiah was upholding the law and protecting the community from potential spiritual corruption. This action reflects the broader theme of Nehemiah's leadership, characterized by a commitment to reform and the restoration of covenant faithfulness. Nehemiah's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who also cleansed the temple and called for purity among God's people (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>).

Jehoiada, a priestly son of Eliashib, should have modeled covenant faithfulness, yet his own offspring compromised.

Because this alliance violated God&#8217;s covenant, Nehemiah decisively removes the offender, illustrating that holiness cannot be sacrificed for social or familial alliances.
