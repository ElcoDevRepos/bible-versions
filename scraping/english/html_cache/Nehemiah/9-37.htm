The abundant harvest signifies the fertility and productivity of the land, which was a blessing from God. However, due to the people's sins, these blessings are now enjoyed by foreign kings. This situation fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, where it is stated that a nation unknown to them would eat the fruit of their labor. The kings set over them are likely the Persian rulers, as Nehemiah was a cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations to discipline His people, as seen in the Babylonian exile.<p><b>And they rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the extent of foreign domination. The Israelites are not only economically oppressed but also physically subjugated. The reference to "bodies" suggests forced labor or servitude, reminiscent of the Egyptian bondage described in Exodus. The control over livestock indicates a loss of autonomy and economic freedom, as livestock were crucial for agriculture and sustenance. This situation is a direct result of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to subjugation by foreign powers.<p><b>We are in great distress.</b><br>The phrase captures the emotional and spiritual state of the Israelites. Their distress is not only due to physical oppression but also a recognition of their spiritual failure. This acknowledgment is part of a larger confession and repentance process seen throughout <a href="/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>, where the people recount their history of rebellion and God's faithfulness. The distress echoes the cries of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>) and during the period of the Judges, where they repeatedly turned back to God in times of trouble. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, pointing to the need for a savior, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and leading spiritual renewal among the Israelites after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are confessing their sins and the sins of their ancestors, acknowledging the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings.htm">Kings</a></b><br>Foreign rulers who have dominion over the Israelites as a result of their disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, significant as the center of Jewish worship and identity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites were taken captive by Babylon, leading to the events described in Nehemiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_sin.htm">Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has tangible consequences, often leading to bondage and distress.
