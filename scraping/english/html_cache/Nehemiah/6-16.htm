The "enemies" refer to groups like the Samaritans, Ammonites, Arabs, and Ashdodites, who opposed the rebuilding efforts (<a href="/nehemiah/4-7.htm">Nehemiah 4:7-8</a>). Their opposition was both political and religious, as the restoration of Jerusalem threatened their influence and challenged their syncretistic worship practices. The news of the wall's completion would have spread quickly, given the interconnected nature of the ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>all the surrounding nations were afraid and disheartened</b><br>The fear and discouragement of the surrounding nations highlight the power and protection of God over His people. This reaction fulfills the promise seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-10.htm">Deuteronomy 28:10</a>, where God assures Israel that if they obey Him, "all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you." The nations' fear is not just of Israel's military might but of the divine favor and presence that enabled such a rapid and successful completion of the wall.<p><b>for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God</b><br>This acknowledgment by the enemies underscores the theme of divine intervention and sovereignty throughout the book of Nehemiah. Despite the opposition, the wall was completed in just 52 days (<a href="/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a>), a feat that could only be attributed to God's involvement. This realization by the nations serves as a testimony to God's power and faithfulness, similar to how the Egyptians recognized God's hand during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-25.htm">Exodus 14:25</a>).
