It consisted of twelve loaves placed on a table in the Holy Place of the Tabernacle and later the Temple, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. This bread was a continual offering before God, symbolizing His provision and the covenant relationship between God and His people. The showbread was replaced every Sabbath, and the old loaves were consumed by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). This practice underscores the importance of regular, ongoing worship and the sustenance provided by God. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), drawing a parallel to the showbread as a type of Christ, who sustains and nourishes spiritually.<p><b>for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings</b><br>Grain offerings and burnt offerings were integral parts of the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law. The grain offering, often consisting of fine flour, oil, and frankincense, was a tribute to God, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving (Leviticus 2). The burnt offering, typically an animal sacrifice, was entirely consumed by fire, representing atonement and complete surrender to God (Leviticus 1). These offerings were made daily, emphasizing the need for continual devotion and atonement. The regularity of these offerings points to the constancy of God's grace and the need for ongoing repentance and dedication. In the New Testament, Christ's sacrifice is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of these offerings, providing a once-for-all atonement for sin (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>for the Sabbath offerings</b><br>Sabbath offerings were additional sacrifices made on the Sabbath day, a day set apart for rest and worship (<a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9-10</a>). These offerings included two lambs, along with grain and drink offerings, highlighting the importance of the Sabbath as a time for spiritual renewal and reflection on God's creation and deliverance. The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>), and its observance is a reminder of God's rest after creation and His deliverance from Egypt. In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the "Lord of the Sabbath" (<a href="/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>), indicating that He fulfills the rest and restoration that the Sabbath symbolizes.<p><b>for the New Moons and appointed feasts</b><br>The New Moon offerings marked the beginning of each month in the Hebrew calendar and were times of special sacrifices and celebrations (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). The appointed feasts, such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, were significant religious festivals that commemorated key events in Israel's history and God's provision (Leviticus 23). These feasts served as reminders of God's faithfulness and the covenant relationship with His people. They also foreshadowed future redemptive events fulfilled in Christ, such as His death and resurrection during Passover and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>for the holy offerings</b><br>Holy offerings refer to various sacrifices and gifts dedicated to God, set apart for sacred purposes. These offerings included peace offerings, vow offerings, and freewill offerings, each with specific regulations and significance (<a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-21</a>). They were expressions of worship, gratitude, and commitment to God. The concept of holiness, being set apart for God, is central to these offerings and reflects the call for believers to live holy lives (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). In Christ, believers are made holy through His sacrifice, and their lives become a living offering to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel</b><br>Sin offerings were sacrifices made to atone for unintentional sins and cleanse the people from impurity (Leviticus 4). These offerings were essential for maintaining the covenant relationship with God and ensuring His presence among His people. The blood of the sin offering was a key element, symbolizing purification and forgiveness. This sacrificial system pointed to the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). Christ's sacrifice is the fulfillment of the sin offering, providing complete and eternal atonement for all who believe.<p><b>and for all the duties of the house of our God</b><br>The duties of the house of God encompassed various responsibilities related to the maintenance and service of the Temple, including the care of sacred objects, the preparation of offerings, and the conduct of worship services. These duties were carried out by the Levites and priests, who were set apart for this sacred work (<a href="/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28-32</a>). The emphasis on these duties highlights the importance of orderly and reverent worship, as well as the communal responsibility to support the house of God. In the New Testament, believers are described as a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, called to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of

obedient to Scripture. Each category highlights a different aspect of God&#8217;s holiness, provision, and grace, all pointing forward to the finished work of Christ.

See <a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-8</a>. Small as the cost of the shew-bread was, consisting, as it did, of no more than twelve cakes of fine flour weekly, it is yet placed first on account of its importance, being the bread of God's presence, the type of the sacramental bread of the new covenant. <span class="cmt_word">The continual meat offering</span> is that offering of flour mingled with fine olive oil which God had required to be offered twice a day, at morning and at evening, in conjunction with the two lambs, which constituted the <span class="cmt_word">continual burnt offering</span> (<a href="/numbers/28-5.htm">Numbers 28:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the sabbaths</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "for the offering of the sabbath days," which consisted of two lambs with appropriate meat and drink offerings, in addition to the offering of every day (<a href="/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of the new moons</span>. Two bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, with appropriate meat and drink offerings (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 11-14). <span class="cmt_word">For the set feasts</span>. The passover, the feast of Pentecost, the feast of trumpets, and the feast of tabernacles. The offerings required at each are given with great exactness in <a href="/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29. <span class="cmt_word">The holy things</span>. "Wave-offerings" and "peace-offerings" (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10, 17, 19</a>) are probably intended. They were "holy to the Lord for the priest" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20). The sin offerings are those commanded in <a href="/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15, 22, 30</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-5.htm">Numbers 29:5, 11, 16, 19</a>, etc<span class="cmt_word">.
