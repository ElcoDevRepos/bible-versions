This serves as a warning against compromising faith for political alliances or personal desires. Solomon's actions are a cautionary tale about the dangers of disobedience to God's commands, specifically the prohibition against intermarrying with pagan nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>).<p><b>There was not a king like him among many nations,</b><br>Solomon's reign was marked by unprecedented prosperity and peace, making him a unique figure among the kings of Israel and the surrounding nations. His wisdom and wealth were unparalleled, as seen in his building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This phrase highlights the exceptional nature of Solomon's rule, which was a fulfillment of God's promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and he was loved by his God,</b><br>God's love for Solomon is evident in the blessings bestowed upon him, including wisdom, wealth, and honor (<a href="/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10-14</a>). This love was conditional upon Solomon's obedience, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Despite his later failings, God's initial favor towards Solomon underscores the potential for divine blessing when one walks in obedience.<p><b>who made him king over all Israel&#8212;</b><br>Solomon's kingship was divinely ordained, fulfilling God's promise to David that his son would succeed him and build the Temple (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-5.htm">1 Chronicles 28:5-6</a>). His rule over a united Israel represents a high point in the nation's history, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His covenant people. This also prefigures the ultimate kingship of Christ, who reigns over a spiritual Israel (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><b>yet foreign women drew him into sin.</b><br>Solomon's marriages to foreign women led him to idolatry, as he built high places for their gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>). This disobedience resulted in God's anger and the eventual division of the kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/11-9.htm">1 Kings 11:9-13</a>). The influence of these women serves as a warning about the spiritual dangers of unequal yoking (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>) and the importance of remaining faithful to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel, known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.
