Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, led the first group of exiles back to Jerusalem and was instrumental in rebuilding the temple (<a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>). Nehemiah, a cupbearer to the Persian king, later returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the city walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2.htm">Nehemiah 2:1-8</a>). Their leadership marked a time of restoration and renewal for the Jewish people, fulfilling prophecies of return from exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><b>all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers</b><br>This highlights the communal responsibility and unity among the Israelites in supporting the temple services. The singers and gatekeepers were essential for the worship and security of the temple, respectively. The daily contributions ensured that these roles could be maintained without interruption, reflecting the importance of worship and order in the life of Israel. This practice is rooted in the instructions given in the Law of Moses, where the community was to support the Levites and those serving in the temple (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>).<p><b>They also set aside daily portions for the Levites</b><br>The Levites, who were responsible for assisting the priests and maintaining the temple, received their sustenance from the offerings of the people. This system of provision was established in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1-8</a>) and ensured that the Levites could focus on their spiritual duties without concern for their material needs. The regularity of these contributions underscores the ongoing commitment of the people to uphold the worship and service of God.<p><b>and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron</b><br>The descendants of Aaron, the priestly line, were given a portion of the offerings to support their work in the temple. This reflects the hierarchical structure within the Levitical system, where the priests had specific roles in offering sacrifices and maintaining the sanctity of the temple. The provision for the Aaronic priests is a fulfillment of God's covenant with Aaron and his descendants (<a href="/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>). This system of support ensured that the spiritual leadership of Israel could function effectively, pointing to the ultimate High Priest, Jesus Christ, who fulfills and surpasses the priestly role (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zerubbabel.htm">Zerubbabel</a></b><br>A leader of the first group of Jews who returned from Babylonian exile.
