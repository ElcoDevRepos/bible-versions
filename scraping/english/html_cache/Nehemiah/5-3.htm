The context is the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls under Nehemiah's leadership, where internal social and economic problems arise. The use of "others" implies that this is not an isolated complaint but part of a larger pattern of distress among the Jewish community.<p><b>We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes</b><br>The act of mortgaging indicates a severe economic crisis. Fields, vineyards, and homes were essential for sustenance and livelihood in ancient Israel. Mortgaging these assets meant risking long-term security for immediate survival. This reflects the socio-economic structure of the time, where land ownership was crucial for maintaining one's family and social status. The Torah, particularly in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, outlines laws regarding land and debt, emphasizing the importance of land as a divine inheritance that should not be permanently lost.<p><b>to get grain during the famine</b><br>The famine mentioned here exacerbates the economic hardship, forcing people to take drastic measures. Famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East and often resulted from drought, war, or poor harvests. Grain was a staple food, and its scarcity would have dire consequences. This situation echoes the story of Joseph in Genesis, where famine led to the centralization of resources in Egypt. Theologically, famines in the Bible often serve as a backdrop for testing faith and reliance on God, as seen in the stories of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem and addressing social injustices among the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jewish_people.htm">The Jewish People</a></b><br>Specifically, those who are suffering economic hardship and are forced to mortgage their properties to survive the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events are taking place, which is in the process of being rebuilt after the Babylonian exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food that exacerbates the economic struggles of the people, leading them to mortgage their properties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields,_vineyards,_and_homes.htm">Fields, Vineyards, and Homes</a></b><br>These represent the livelihood and heritage of the Jewish people, which they are forced to risk losing due to the economic crisis.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/economic_justice_and_compassion.htm">Economic Justice and Compassion</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of addressing economic injustices within a community.
