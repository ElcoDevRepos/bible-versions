The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal name of God, highlighting His eternal and self-existent nature. This is a reminder of God's faithfulness and His role as the divine ruler over all creation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a> where God reveals His name to Moses.<p><b>who chose Abram</b><br>God's choice of Abram (later Abraham) is a foundational moment in biblical history, marking the beginning of the covenant relationship with the Hebrew people. This divine election is an act of grace, not based on Abram's merit, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>. It underscores the theme of God's sovereign will in choosing individuals for His purposes, a concept echoed in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29-30</a>.<p><b>who brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans</b><br>Ur was an ancient city in Mesopotamia, known for its advanced culture and idolatry. God's call to Abram to leave Ur (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31, 12</a>:1) signifies a break from his past and the idolatrous practices of his homeland. This journey symbolizes a spiritual pilgrimage towards a life of faith and obedience. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed Ur's historical significance, providing context for Abram's departure.<p><b>and gave him the name Abraham</b><br>The change from Abram to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) signifies a transformation in identity and purpose. "Abram" means "exalted father," while "Abraham" means "father of many nations," reflecting God's promise to make him the progenitor of a multitude of descendants. This name change is a prophetic act, foreshadowing the fulfillment of God's covenant and the coming of the Messiah, through whom all nations would be blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians
