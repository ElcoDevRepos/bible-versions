The priests were responsible for maintaining the temple worship and rituals, which were central to Jewish religious life. The emphasis on priestly lineage underscores the need for purity and legitimacy in temple service, as outlined in the Law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>).<p><b>the descendants of Hobaiah,</b><br>Hobaiah is a name that appears only in this context, suggesting a lesser-known priestly family. The mention of descendants implies a continuation of the family line, which was crucial for maintaining the priestly duties. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in preserving His people and their roles throughout generations.<p><b>the descendants of Hakkoz,</b><br>Hakkoz is a more prominent priestly family, mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-10.htm">1 Chronicles 24:10</a> as one of the divisions of priests established by King David. This connection to David's organization of the priesthood highlights the historical continuity and the importance of maintaining the divinely ordained order of worship.<p><b>and the descendants of Barzillai</b><br>Barzillai is a notable figure, known for his support of King David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>). His descendants' inclusion among the priests suggests a merging of influential families, which was not uncommon in ancient Israel. This connection to David's time reinforces the theme of loyalty and support for God's anointed leaders.<p><b>(who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name).</b><br>This parenthetical note provides insight into the cultural practice of name adoption through marriage, which could signify the merging of family lines and inheritance rights. Barzillai the Gileadite's legacy was significant enough that his name carried weight and honor, indicating the high regard in which he was held. This practice also reflects the broader biblical theme of identity and belonging, as seen in Ruth's integration into the Israelite community (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hobaiah.htm">Hobaiah</a></b><br>A priestly family mentioned in the context of those returning from exile.

The same verification appears earlier in <a href="/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36&#8211;39</a>, showing that priestly lineage was taken seriously for the purity of worship (cf. <a href="/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Descendants of Hobaiah</b><p>&#8226;
