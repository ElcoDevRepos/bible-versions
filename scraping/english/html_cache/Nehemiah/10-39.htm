The contributions of grain, new wine, and oil were essential offerings in the Old Testament, used for sustenance and religious rituals. Grain offerings were a staple in the sacrificial system (Leviticus 2), symbolizing dedication to God. New wine and oil were also significant, representing joy and the anointing of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a>, <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The inclusion of both Israelites and Levites underscores the communal effort in maintaining worship practices, reflecting the covenant community's commitment to God.<p><b>to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept</b><br>The storerooms were designated areas within the temple complex for storing offerings and sacred items. These storerooms ensured that the temple had a continuous supply of necessary materials for worship and sacrifices. The articles of the sanctuary included items used in daily temple rituals, such as utensils, incense, and other sacred objects (<a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>). This organization reflects the meticulous care and reverence for the temple, emphasizing the holiness and order required in worship.<p><b>and where the ministering priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers stay</b><br>This phrase identifies the various roles within the temple service. The ministering priests were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple's spiritual integrity (<a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>). Gatekeepers ensured the security and order of the temple, controlling access to the sacred spaces (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17-27</a>). Singers played a crucial role in worship, leading the congregation in praise and enhancing the spiritual atmosphere (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>). Each group had a specific function, illustrating the diverse yet unified effort required to maintain the temple's operations.<p><b>Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.</b><br>This concluding statement reflects a collective commitment to prioritize the temple, which was central to Israel's religious life. Neglecting the house of God would signify a lapse in spiritual devotion and covenant faithfulness. The phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of maintaining God's dwelling place, seen in the construction of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>) and Solomon's temple (1 Kings 6). It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>), emphasizing the importance of spiritual upkeep and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are committing to uphold the covenant and support the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties, responsible for assisting the priests and maintaining the temple.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/ministering_priests.htm">Ministering Priests</a></b><br>Those who perform the sacred duties in the temple, offering sacrifices and leading worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gatekeepers.htm">Gatekeepers</a></b><br>Individuals tasked with guarding the temple, ensuring its sanctity and security.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/singers.htm">Singers</a></b><br>Levites assigned to lead worship through music, an integral part of temple services.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/s/storerooms.htm">Storerooms</a></b><br>Designated areas in the temple for storing offerings and supplies necessary for worship and temple maintenance.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_our_god.htm">House of our God</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_house.htm">Commitment to God's House</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites committed to not neglecting the temple, Christians today should prioritize their local church, supporting it through attendance, service, and giving.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_generosity.htm">Stewardship and Generosity</a></b><br>The contributions of grain, wine, and oil symbolize the broader principle of giving back to God from what He has provided.

And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.">Nehemiah 13:11-14</a>.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering.</span> The priests were not to be troubled with the conveyance of any of the offerings. The first-fruits and other oblations of the people were to be brought to the temple by the people themselves; and the "tithe of the tithe,' which was the priests' due, by the Levites. Thus the priests would not be drawn away from their duty of ministering in the temple by secular employments and matters of mere worldly business. <span class="cmt_word">We will not forsake, or neglect, the house of our God</span>. We will not suffer, that is, any interruption of the continual service of the temple, we will not be parties to any neglect or slovenliness in the conduct of it. So far as we are concerned, everything shall be done to enable the priests and Levites to remain constantly at Jerusalem in full numbers, and to devote themselves wholly to their sacred duties in God's house. With this emphatic declaration of their intentions the people concluded the engagements by which they voluntarily bound themselves. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the Levites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
