The valley mentioned is likely the Kidron Valley, which runs along the eastern side of Jerusalem. Conducting this inspection at night allowed Nehemiah to assess the damage without drawing attention from potential adversaries or causing alarm among the inhabitants. This action demonstrates wisdom and prudence, qualities often associated with effective leadership in the Bible. The nighttime inspection also symbolizes the spiritual vigilance required to discern and address the broken areas in one's life or community.<p><b>and inspected the wall.</b><br>The inspection of the wall was crucial for Nehemiah to understand the extent of the damage and to plan the necessary repairs. Walls in ancient cities were vital for protection against enemies, and their condition was directly linked to the city's security and the people's morale. Nehemiah's careful examination signifies the importance of assessing the current state before undertaking a restoration project. This act can be seen as a metaphor for self-examination and the need to identify areas in one's life that require rebuilding or strengthening, aligning with the biblical theme of restoration.<p><b>Then I headed back and reentered through the Valley Gate.</b><br>The Valley Gate was one of the gates of Jerusalem, located on the western side of the city. Nehemiah's return through this gate indicates a completion of his reconnaissance mission. The Valley Gate's mention highlights the organized structure of Jerusalem's defenses and the importance of each gate in the city's overall security. Historically, gates were not only entry points but also places of commerce and legal transactions. Nehemiah's reentry through the Valley Gate signifies a return to the community with a renewed vision and plan for restoration. This action can be seen as a precursor to the rebuilding efforts that follow, emphasizing themes of renewal and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader and cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, tasked with rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley.htm">The Valley</a></b><br>Likely referring to the Kidron Valley, which runs along the eastern side of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall.htm">The Wall</a></b><br>The wall of Jerusalem, which had been broken down and needed repair.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_gate.htm">The Valley Gate</a></b><br>One of the gates of Jerusalem, located in the western part of the city, through which Nehemiah entered and exited during his inspection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inspection_by_night.htm">Inspection by Night</a></b><br>Nehemiah's strategic decision to inspect the wall at night to avoid drawing attention to his plans prematurely.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_planning.htm">Strategic Planning</a></b><br>Nehemiah's inspection of the wall at night underscores the importance of strategic planning and discretion in leadership.

Earlier he records, &#8220;I set out by night with only a few men&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>). In hostile surroundings, discretion protects the work God has assigned.<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows night missions advancing God&#8217;s plans&#8212;think of the spies in Jericho (<a href="/bsb/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>) or Paul lowered from Damascus &#8220;by night&#8221; (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>). Each instance highlights trusting obedience coupled with practical caution.<p>&#8226; This valley route likely follows the Kidron, a quiet path that lets Nehemiah observe without drawing attention. It reminds us that God sometimes leads His servants through hidden places before public action (compare <a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and inspected the wall</b><p>&#8226; Nehemiah does not rely on hearsay; he looks &#8220;carefully&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>) at every breach. Wise leadership starts with honest assessment&#8212;&#8220;Be sure to know the condition of your flocks&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed the same principle: &#8220;Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>). Planning is faith&#8217;s companion, not its rival.<p>&#8226; The wall is literal, yet it also pictures the spiritual boundaries that protect God&#8217;s people. A broken wall exposes families and churches to enemy attack (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). Nehemiah&#8217;s inspection challenges us to examine our own defenses (1 <a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then I headed back</b><p>&#8226; After gathering facts, Nehemiah returns to where the leaders wait (<a href="/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>).

Observation without action breeds discouragement, but observation followed by prayerful strategy fuels hope (compare <a href="/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reentered through the Valley Gate</b><p>&#8226; The Valley Gate anchors the western wall, a practical exit for workers heading to the lower city.

Passing this gate again underlines that rebuilding begins with humble trust (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The closed loop also confirms security: no breach went uninspected, no enemy spotted him. God preserved both the messenger and the message.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/2-15.htm">Nehemiah 2:15</a> records more than a midnight stroll; it showcases Spirit-led leadership. Moving under cover of night, Nehemiah gathers accurate information, measures the damage, then returns through the Valley Gate poised to rally God&#8217;s people. His example marries faith with prudence, vigilance with humility, and planning with absolute confidence that the Lord will restore what is broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">By the gate of the valley, and so returned.</span>--The itineration seems to have completed the circuit of the walls.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the brook</span>.
