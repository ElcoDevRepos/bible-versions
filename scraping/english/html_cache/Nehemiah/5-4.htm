The context of <a href="/nehemiah/5.htm">Nehemiah 5</a> reveals a time of economic distress and social injustice among the returned exiles. The phrase suggests a communal outcry, highlighting the widespread nature of the problem. This communal aspect is reminiscent of other biblical instances where the people of Israel collectively express their grievances, such as in <a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>, where the Israelites groan under Egyptian bondage.<p><b>We have borrowed money</b><br>Borrowing money in ancient times often led to severe consequences, including servitude or loss of property. The Law of Moses provided guidelines for lending and borrowing, emphasizing fairness and compassion (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>). The need to borrow indicates a failure in the community to uphold these laws, reflecting a deeper spiritual and social crisis. This situation parallels the warnings in Proverbs about the dangers of debt (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>).<p><b>to pay the king&#8217;s tax</b><br>The king referred to here is likely Artaxerxes I of Persia, under whose reign Nehemiah served as governor. The Persian Empire imposed heavy taxes on its provinces, which could be burdensome for the local populations. This taxation system is corroborated by historical records from the Persian period, which describe the administrative and fiscal policies of the empire. The burden of taxation is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>, where Samuel warns the Israelites about the demands a king would place on them.<p><b>on our fields and vineyards</b><br>Fields and vineyards were vital to the agrarian economy of ancient Israel, representing both sustenance and wealth. The loss or mortgaging of these lands would have been devastating, threatening the livelihood and heritage of families. This situation echoes the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30-33</a> about the consequences of disobedience to God&#8217;s covenant, where foreign powers would consume the produce of the land. The mention of fields and vineyards also evokes the imagery of the Promised Land, a place of abundance and blessing, now under threat due to external pressures and internal failings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is serving as the governor of Judah.

Nehemiah records a chorus of complaints; this third group speaks up after those who lacked grain (<a href="/nehemiah/5-2.htm">Nehemiah 5:2</a>) and those who mortgaged property (<a href="/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Their words widen the picture of distress, showing that hardship was not isolated but widespread&#8212;much like the groaning of Israel under Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-24</a>) or the lament of the returned exiles in <a href="/ezra/9-4.htm">Ezra 9:4</a>.<p>&#8226; By including &#8220;others,&#8221; Scripture underscores unity in suffering and sets the stage for Nehemiah&#8217;s corporate response (<a href="/nehemiah/5-6.htm">Nehemiah 5:6-11</a>; cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have borrowed money</b><p>&#8226;

Proverbs cautions, &#8220;The borrower is slave to the lender&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>), a reality now felt in Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s heart is for generosity, not exploitation. Commands to lend without interest (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>) stand in sharp contrast to the oppressive terms these families faced.<p>&#8226; Nehemiah soon rebukes the nobles for exacting interest (<a href="/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7-10</a>), echoing earlier prophets who condemned economic injustice (<a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>; <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To pay the king&#8217;s tax</b><p>&#8226; The Persian empire required land taxes, a burden that fell hardest on smallholders. Ezra&#8217;s contemporaries already knew such levies could &#8220;damage the revenue of the king&#8221; if unpaid (<a href="/ezra/4-13.htm">Ezra 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Taxation had long been a sore point in Israelite history; Samuel warned that kings would &#8220;take a tenth of your grain and your vintage&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying &#8220;the king&#8217;s,&#8221; the text highlights foreign domination. Even in their own land, the returned exiles served another ruler (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/9-36.htm">Nehemiah 9:36-37</a>).<p>&#8226; This financial strain threatened both worship (tithes) and livelihood, mirroring the later poll-tax crisis under Caesar that provoked Jesus&#8217; famous &#8220;Render to Caesar&#8221; teaching (<a href="/matthew/22-17.htm">Matthew 22:17-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On our fields and vineyards</b><p>&#8226; Fields and vineyards were covenant gifts (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>).

To stake them for debt was to mortgage hope itself.<p>&#8226; The scene recalls Naboth, who refused to sell &#8220;the inheritance of my fathers&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-3.htm">1 Kings 21:3</a>). Here, however, circumstances forced the people to pledge what should have remained in the family.<p>&#8226; Nehemiah later ensures restoration, compelling lenders to give back fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses (<a href="/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a>), fulfilling the Jubilee spirit (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/5-4.htm">Nehemiah 5:4</a> exposes a chain reaction of hardship: widespread complaint, desperate borrowing, oppressive taxation, and threatened inheritance. Literally read, the verse shows families pushed to pledge their God-given land just to satisfy imperial demands. The complaint becomes a catalyst for righteous leadership, as Nehemiah confronts economic injustice and restores covenant faithfulness. The passage reminds believers today that God hears the cry of the oppressed, opposes exploitative systems, and calls His people to practical, compassionate action grounded in His unchanging Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">We have borrowed money for the king's tribute.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">we have made our fields and vineyards answerable</span> for the payment of the Persian tribute.

Judaea, like other Persian provinces, had to pay a tribute, partly in money and partly in kind, yearly to the Persian monarch (see the comment on Ezra 4:13); but there is no reason to believe that this burthen was generally felt as oppressive, nor that it was heavier in Judaea than elsewhere. But by the very poor even a small amount of direct taxation is felt as a grievance; and the necessity of meeting the demands of the tax-gatherer was in the ancient world often the turning-point, which compelled the contracting of a debt (Liv., 2:23);
