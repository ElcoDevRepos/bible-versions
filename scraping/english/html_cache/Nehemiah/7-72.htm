The daric was a gold coin used during the Persian Empire, indicating the influence of Persian culture and economy on the Jewish people during this period. The significant amount of gold reflects the dedication and sacrifice of the people, reminiscent of the contributions for the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-22.htm">Exodus 35:22</a>. This act of giving can be seen as a type of Christ's sacrificial giving, as the people willingly offered their resources for the restoration of Jerusalem, foreshadowing Christ's ultimate sacrifice for the restoration of humanity.<p><b>2,000 minas of silver</b><br>The mina was a unit of weight and currency in the ancient Near East. The substantial amount of silver given by the people underscores their commitment to the cause. Silver, often associated with redemption in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>), symbolizes the people's desire for spiritual renewal and redemption. This contribution parallels the silver used in the construction of the Tabernacle, where it served as a ransom for each Israelite, pointing to the redemptive work of Christ.<p><b>and 67 priestly garments</b><br>The mention of priestly garments emphasizes the importance of worship and the role of the priesthood in the community. These garments were essential for the priests to perform their duties in the Temple, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. The provision of these garments signifies the people's recognition of the need for proper worship and the restoration of religious practices. This can be seen as a type of Christ, our High Priest, who provides the ultimate means of worship and access to God. The number 67, while not having a specific biblical significance, indicates the detailed record-keeping and organization involved in the rebuilding process.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah who led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and initiated reforms to restore the community's spiritual and social order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The collective group of Israelites who contributed to the rebuilding efforts and the restoration of the temple services.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the walls were rebuilt under Nehemiah's leadership, symbolizing the restoration of the Jewish community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/darics_and_minas.htm">Darics and Minas</a></b><br>Units of currency and weight used in the contributions, indicating the people's generosity and commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/priestly_garments.htm">Priestly Garments</a></b><br>Sacred clothing for the priests, signifying the restoration of proper worship and temple service.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_in_community_building.htm">Generosity in Community Building</a></b><br>The people's contributions highlight the importance of collective effort and sacrifice in achieving communal goals.

This phrase reminds us that God values every member of the community, not only the prominent ones (<a href="/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-22</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-14.htm">1 Corinthians 12:14-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their participation shows a shared commitment to God&#8217;s work; they did not leave the burden on a few. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/29-9.htm">1 Chronicles 29:9</a>, where &#8220;the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders&#8221; and then added their own offerings.<p>&#8226; The scene reflects the teaching of <a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>&#8212;many members, one body, each contributing according to grace given.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gave a total of 20,000 darics of gold</b><p>&#8226; A daric was a Persian gold coin; 20,000 of them represent an enormous sum. The Scripture states it plainly, underscoring both the literal amount and the literal generosity.<p>&#8226; Their giving mirrors earlier patterns: <a href="/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a> records 61,000 darics offered for the first return, and <a href="/1_chronicles/29-7.htm">1 Chronicles 29:7</a> tells of 10,000 darics for Solomon&#8217;s temple. God repeatedly stirs hearts to give extravagantly when His house is involved.<p>&#8226; Such generosity flows from gratitude, not compulsion (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). Like the widow&#8217;s two small coins (<a href="/luke/21-1.htm">Luke 21:1-4</a>), the heart behind the offering matters most; yet here the Lord also highlights the magnitude to show what unified obedience can accomplish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>2,000 minas of silver</b><p>&#8226; A mina weighed about fifty shekels; 2,000 minas equal roughly three tons of silver&#8212;again, a literal figure emphasizing collective sacrifice.<p>&#8226; Silver in Scripture often speaks of redemption (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>, the atonement money). Their silver, placed into temple service, pointed to the greater redemption God would ultimately provide (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Nehemiah records exact numbers to demonstrate accountability (compare <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>). God&#8217;s people handle resources transparently, assuring all that the gifts truly reach their intended purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and 67 priestly garments</b><p>&#8226; Beyond metals, the people supplied &#8220;67 priestly garments.&#8221; Priestly robes were costly (<a href="/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2-4</a>) and essential for ministry; providing them ensured that worship could proceed according to God&#8217;s stipulations.<p>&#8226; The number is specific, again highlighting meticulous stewardship. It also illustrates varied gifts: some gave wealth, others items of craftsmanship (cf. <a href="/exodus/35-25.htm">Exodus 35:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; New garments symbolize purity and restoration (<a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3-5</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). By furnishing these robes, the people affirmed their desire for holy priests and pure worship in the rebuilt Jerusalem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/7-72.htm">Nehemiah 7:72</a> records common citizens joining leaders in lavish, specific, and accountable giving. Their gold, silver, and priestly garments reveal wholehearted unity, tangible sacrifice, and a passion for pure worship. The verse encourages believers today to participate willingly, give generously, and steward transparently so that God&#8217;s work flourishes and His name is honored.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/7-72.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7611.htm">Strong's 7611: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rest, residue, remnant, remainder</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
