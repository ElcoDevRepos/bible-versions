It was named for its use by horses, likely those used by the king's army. This gate's proximity to the temple signifies the importance of readiness and defense in spiritual matters. In <a href="/2_chronicles/23-15.htm">2 Chronicles 23:15</a>, the Horse Gate is mentioned in the context of the execution of Queen Athaliah, highlighting its strategic importance. The gate's location suggests a connection to the royal stables and the military, symbolizing strength and vigilance in the faith community.<p><b>each of the priests made repairs</b><br>The involvement of priests in the repair work underscores the communal effort in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. It reflects the principle that spiritual leaders are not exempt from physical labor and community service. This action can be seen as a type of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). The priests' participation also emphasizes the sanctity of the work, as they were consecrated individuals ensuring that the repairs were done with spiritual integrity.<p><b>in front of his own house</b><br>This phrase indicates personal responsibility and investment in the community's welfare. By repairing the section of the wall nearest to their homes, the priests demonstrated a commitment to protecting their families and neighbors. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, which stresses the importance of providing for one's household. The personal nature of the work also suggests a deeper spiritual truth: that one's faith and actions should begin at home, serving as a foundation for broader community engagement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah who led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.
