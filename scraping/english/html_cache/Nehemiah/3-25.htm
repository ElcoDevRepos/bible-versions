The mention of his father, Uzai, helps to identify his lineage, which was important in Jewish culture for establishing identity and heritage. The act of making repairs signifies the communal effort and dedication to restoring the city, a task that required cooperation and unity among the Israelites. This reflects the broader theme of Nehemiah, which emphasizes the importance of community and collective action in achieving God's purposes.<p><b>opposite the angle and the tower that juts out</b><br>The "angle" and "tower" refer to specific architectural features of the wall. The angle likely indicates a corner or a bend in the wall, which would have been a strategic point needing fortification. Towers were crucial for defense, providing a vantage point to watch for approaching enemies. The detailed description underscores the meticulous planning involved in the reconstruction, highlighting the importance of strategic defense in ancient cities. This also reflects the biblical theme of God as a protector and fortress for His people.<p><b>from the upper palace of the king</b><br>The "upper palace" refers to a significant structure within Jerusalem, possibly part of the royal complex. This palace would have been a symbol of authority and governance. Its mention indicates the proximity of the repairs to important civic and governmental buildings, emphasizing the need to protect these key areas. The palace's location also suggests the interconnectedness of religious, political, and social life in Jerusalem, a city central to God's covenant with Israel.<p><b>near the courtyard of the guard</b><br>The "courtyard of the guard" was likely an area associated with the security forces of the city, responsible for maintaining order and protecting the inhabitants. This location highlights the importance of security and vigilance in the life of the community. The presence of guards also points to the constant threat of external aggression, a reality for Jerusalem throughout its history. This reflects the biblical theme of watchfulness and the need for spiritual and physical readiness.<p><b>Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh</b><br>Pedaiah, whose name means "Yahweh has ransomed," is another individual involved in the reconstruction effort. The mention of his father, Parosh, connects him to a family that returned from exile, as listed in <a href="/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3</a>. This connection underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to bring His people back to their land. The phrase "next to him" indicates the collaborative nature of the work, with each family or group taking responsibility for a section of the wall. This cooperation is a testament to the unity and shared purpose among the Israelites, reflecting the biblical principle of working together for the common good.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/palal_son_of_uzai.htm">Palal son of Uzai</a></b><br>A worker on the wall, Palal is noted for his efforts in repairing a specific section of Jerusalem's wall.

In the original it is uncertain whether the word translated "high" belongs to "tower" or "house." Most commentators attach it to "tower." The "king's house" of this place can be nothing but the old palace of David, which was in this quarter, while Solomon's was on the opposite, or western, hill This palace, like Solomon s (<a href="/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2</a>), would naturally have its <span class="cmt_word">prison</span>, which would stand in its own <span class="cmt_word">court</span>. From this prison, the "prison gate" of <a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a> took its name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Palal</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;l&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6420.htm">Strong's 6420: </a> </span><span class="str2">Palal -- a builder of the Jerusalem wall</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Uzai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1463;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#363;&#183;zay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_186.htm">Strong's 186: </a> </span><span class="str2">Uzai -- a Judean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[made repairs] opposite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1490;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;ne&#183;&#7713;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5048.htm">Strong's 5048: </a> </span><span class="str2">A front, part opposite, a counterpart, mate, over against, before</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the angle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1463;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;miq&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
