It highlights a recurring theme in the Old Testament where the people of Israel repeatedly turned away from God despite His faithfulness. This pattern is seen throughout the books of Exodus, Judges, and Kings, where the Israelites often fell into cycles of disobedience and repentance. The mention of "our fathers" connects the current generation with their historical lineage, emphasizing the continuity of their identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>became arrogant</b><br>Arrogance here signifies a prideful attitude that leads to self-reliance and a rejection of God's authority. This is a common issue addressed by the prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who warned against the dangers of pride. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> states, "Pride goes before destruction," illustrating the spiritual peril of arrogance. In the context of Nehemiah, this arrogance is a reminder of the Israelites' failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty and their dependence on Him.<p><b>and stiff-necked</b><br>The term "stiff-necked" is a metaphor used frequently in the Bible to describe stubbornness and resistance to divine guidance. It originates from the imagery of an ox that refuses to be directed by its master. This description is used in <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, where God calls the Israelites a "stiff-necked people" after they worship the golden calf. It underscores the Israelites' unwillingness to submit to God's will and their persistent rebellion.<p><b>and did not obey Your commandments</b><br>Disobedience to God's commandments is a central theme in the narrative of Israel's history. The commandments, given through Moses, were meant to guide the Israelites in living a life pleasing to God. Their failure to obey is documented throughout the Old Testament, leading to consequences such as exile and oppression. This disobedience is contrasted with the call to faithfulness and obedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. The phrase also foreshadows the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed God's law and offers redemption for humanity's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and the spiritual renewal of the people.
