This reflects the biblical principle of seeking wisdom and understanding before acting, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. It also demonstrates the importance of discernment and prayerful consideration in leadership, akin to Jesus' practice of withdrawing to pray before making significant decisions (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12-13</a>).<p><b>I rebuked the nobles and officials</b><br>Nehemiah directly confronted those in positions of power, showing his commitment to justice and righteousness. This mirrors the prophetic tradition of holding leaders accountable, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>).

Nehemiah's rebuke highlights the violation of covenantal laws meant to ensure community welfare and solidarity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of economic justice and care for the poor, which Jesus also emphasized in His teachings (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<p><b>So I called a large assembly against them</b><br>Nehemiah's decision to gather the community reflects the biblical principle of communal accountability and the importance of public correction in restoring justice. This assembly served as a means to address grievances and restore social order, similar to the early church's practice of resolving disputes within the community (<a href="/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6-21</a>).

He therefore translates, "I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye <span class="accented">lend upon pledge</span>." <span class="cmt_word">I set a great assembly against them</span>. It is evident that Nehemiah's rebuke had no effect. The nobles gave him no reason to think that they would change their conduct.
