Nehemiah, a cupbearer to the Persian king, begins his mission with prayer, setting an example of seeking divine guidance before taking action. This reflects the biblical principle of acknowledging God in all endeavors (<a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>).<p><b>O LORD, God of heaven:</b><br>The title "God of heaven" emphasizes God's sovereignty and supreme authority over all creation. This title is significant in the post-exilic context, as it acknowledges God's rule beyond the earthly realm, contrasting with the limited power of earthly kings. It aligns with Daniel's recognition of God's dominion (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19-23</a>).<p><b>the great and awesome God:</b><br>This description of God underscores His majesty and power, inspiring reverence and awe. It reflects the biblical theme of God's greatness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>, where God is described as "God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God." This acknowledgment sets the tone for a prayer of humility and dependence.<p><b>who keeps His covenant of loving devotion:</b><br>The reference to God's covenant highlights His faithfulness and steadfast love (Hebrew: "hesed"). This covenantal relationship is central to the Old Testament, beginning with Abraham and continuing through Moses and David. It assures believers of God's unwavering commitment to His promises, as seen in <a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>.<p><b>with those who love Him and keep His commandments:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the conditional aspect of the covenant, requiring love and obedience from God's people. It echoes the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for wholehearted love and adherence to God's laws. This relationship between love and obedience is further affirmed by Jesus in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is the central figure in the book.

He does not rush to action first; he turns to God in prayer (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows leaders pausing to seek the Lord before acting&#8212;Moses before the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-15</a>), David before battle (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>), and Jesus before choosing the Twelve (<a href="/luke/6-12.htm">Luke 6:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226;

As there are no sufficient grounds for questioning the generally received date of Daniel's prophecy ( <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>), we must suppose Nehemiah familiar with his writings, and an admirer of their tone and spirit.
