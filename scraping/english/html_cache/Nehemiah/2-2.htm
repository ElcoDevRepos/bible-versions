Nehemiah served as the king's cupbearer, a position of trust and influence. The king's willingness to speak directly to Nehemiah suggests a level of familiarity and concern. In the Persian court, such interactions were significant, as they could lead to opportunities or dangers, depending on the king's disposition.<p><b>&#8220;Why is your face sad, though you are not ill?</b><br>The king's observation highlights his attentiveness to Nehemiah's demeanor. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, facial expressions were often seen as reflections of one's inner state. The king's question implies that he knew Nehemiah well enough to notice a change in his usual demeanor. This also suggests that Nehemiah had maintained a positive and professional appearance in the king's presence, making his current sadness notable.<p><b>This could only be sadness of the heart.&#8221;</b><br>The king discerns that Nehemiah's sadness is not due to physical illness but an emotional or spiritual burden. This insight reflects the king's perceptiveness and possibly his own experience with matters of the heart. In biblical terms, the heart is often seen as the seat of emotions and intentions (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). Nehemiah's burden for Jerusalem and its people is a deep, heartfelt concern, aligning with the biblical theme of God's people mourning over the desolation of their homeland (<a href="/psalms/137.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>).<p><b>I was overwhelmed with fear</b><br>Nehemiah's fear is understandable given the context. Approaching the king with a personal request could be dangerous, as Persian kings were known for their absolute authority and could react unpredictably. Nehemiah's fear also reflects the gravity of his request to return to Jerusalem to rebuild its walls. This moment of fear is a turning point, as it precedes Nehemiah's bold step of faith, reminiscent of other biblical figures who faced fear before acting in faith, such as Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian King Artaxerxes, Nehemiah is deeply concerned about the state of Jerusalem and its walls.

Artaxerxes&#8217; simple question unearths Nehemiah&#8217;s burden, proving that the Lord orchestrates conversations, emotions, and even fears for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Then I was very sore afraid.</span>--Waiting on Providence, Nehemiah had discharged his duties for three months without being sad in the king's presence; but on this day his sorrow could not be repressed. His fear sprang from the king's abrupt inquiry. A sad countenance was never tolerated in the royal presence; and, though Artaxerxes was of a milder character than any other Persian monarch, the tone of his question showed that in this respect he was not an exception.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad?</span> This "kindly question" put by the great king to his humble retainer is his best claim to the favourable judgment of later ages. History puts him before us as a weak monarch, one who could compromise the royal dignity by making terms with a revolted subject, while he disgraced it by breaking faith with a conquered enemy. But if weak as a king, as a man he was kind-hearted and gentle. Few Persian monarchs would have been sufficiently interested in their attendants to notice whether they were sad or no; fewer still would have shown sympathy on such an occasion. A Xerxes might have ordered the culprit to instant execution. Longimanus feels compassion, and wishes to assuage the grief of his servant. <span class="cmt_word">Then I was very sore afraid</span>. Notwithstanding the king's kind and compassionate words, Nehemiah feels his danger. He has looked sad in the king's presence. He is about to ask permission to quit the court. These are both sins against the fundamental doctrine of Persian court life, that to bask in the light of the royal countenance is the height of felicity. Will the king be displeased, refuse his request, dismiss him from his post, cast him into prison, or will he pardon his rudeness and allow his request? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">so the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
