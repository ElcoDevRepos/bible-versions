His reply is not just a personal decision but a public declaration of his commitment to God's work. This mirrors the biblical principle of standing firm in faith, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to stand their ground.<p><b>Should a man like me run away?</b><br>Nehemiah questions the appropriateness of fleeing in the face of danger. As a leader, he recognizes the importance of setting an example of courage and faithfulness. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/proverbs/28.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>, where the righteous are described as bold as a lion. Nehemiah's rhetorical question implies that his position and calling demand steadfastness, not cowardice.<p><b>Should one like me go into the temple to save his own life?</b><br>Nehemiah understands the sanctity of the temple and the restrictions on who may enter. His refusal to misuse the temple for personal safety reflects his respect for God's laws, as seen in <a href="/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>, which outlines the duties and restrictions of temple service. This also highlights the theme of integrity, as Nehemiah refuses to compromise his principles for self-preservation.<p><b>I will not go!</b><br>Nehemiah's firm declaration underscores his resolve and trust in God. His decision not to enter the temple for refuge is an act of faith, trusting God for protection rather than resorting to actions that would violate his conscience. This determination is reminiscent of Daniel's resolve in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, where Daniel continues to pray despite the threat of the lion's den. Nehemiah's stance can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the face of danger, remained committed to His mission and purpose, ultimately trusting in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Nehemiah is the governor of Judah and a key leader in the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls.

Dean Stanley compares Becket's noble words, - "I will not turn the cathedral into a castle," - but the parallel is not close. Nehemiah feels, not that he would profane the temple by making it into a place of refuge, but that he would break the law by simply entering it. Ewald shows that he has caught the point of the objection when he says, "Nehemiah thought that, as a <span class="accented">layman</span>, he must not break the Divine command by entering the sanctuary itself" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
