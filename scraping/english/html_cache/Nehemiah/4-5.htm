In the context of Nehemiah, the opposition faced by the Jews rebuilding Jerusalem's walls was intense. Nehemiah's prayer is a call for God not to overlook the sins of their enemies. This echoes the imprecatory psalms, where the psalmist calls for God's judgment on the wicked (e.g., <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27</a>). Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's righteousness and justice, where sin must be acknowledged and dealt with.<p><b>or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight</b><br>The concept of sin being "blotted out" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with forgiveness and atonement (e.g., <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>). Here, however, Nehemiah asks for the opposite, emphasizing the seriousness of the opposition's actions. This reflects the covenantal understanding that sin has consequences and must be addressed by God. The phrase also highlights the belief in God's omniscience, where nothing is hidden from His sight.<p><b>for they have provoked the builders</b><br>The term "provoked" indicates deliberate antagonism. Historically, the builders faced threats and ridicule from surrounding nations, including the Samaritans and Ammonites, who were threatened by the restoration of Jerusalem. This opposition is documented in the earlier chapters of Nehemiah and reflects the broader historical context of post-exilic Judah, where returning exiles faced hostility. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, where God's people face opposition in fulfilling His purposes, a theme echoed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

Sanballat and Tobiah have ridiculed the returning exiles, trying to break their resolve.<p>&#8226; By asking, &#8220;Do not cover up their iniquity,&#8221; Nehemiah appeals to God&#8217;s perfect justice. He is not taking vengeance personally; he is entrusting the matter to the Lord (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Such prayers echo earlier cries for righteous judgment (<a href="/psalms/109-1.htm">Psalm 109:1-5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-19.htm">Jeremiah 18:19-23</a>). Scripture consistently affirms that while individuals must forgive, they may still ask God to deal with unrepentant evil.<p>&#8226; The phrase also underscores the seriousness of sin. To &#8220;cover up&#8221; wrongdoing would misrepresent God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6</a>). Nehemiah wants truth brought into the light so the work can proceed unhindered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Blotting out&#8221; evokes the image of a ledger where sins can be erased (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). Nehemiah pleads that the record remain until justice is satisfied.<p>&#8226; He is not denying God&#8217;s mercy; he is highlighting that mercy is reserved for the repentant (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>). These opponents show no contrition, only contempt.<p>&#8226; The request is rooted in covenant reality: persistent hostility toward God&#8217;s people is hostility toward God Himself (<a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a>). Removing their sin from divine view prematurely would imply their actions are inconsequential.<p>&#8226; By keeping the offense before His sight, the Lord is asked to act decisively, vindicating His name and protecting His mission (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they have provoked the builders</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Provoked&#8221; points to deliberate agitation. Sanballat&#8217;s taunts&#8212;&#8220;What are these feeble Jews doing?&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>)&#8212;targeted the hearts of the laborers.<p>&#8226; Attacking the builders is tantamount to attacking God&#8217;s rebuilding plan (<a href="/ezra/4-4.htm">Ezra 4:4-5</a>; <a href="/acts/5-38.htm">Acts 5:38-39</a>). The opposition is spiritual as much as political.<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that anyone who tries to destroy God&#8217;s building&#8212;His people&#8212;invites judgment (1 <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16-17</a>). Nehemiah&#8217;s prayer aligns with that principle.<p>&#8226; The provocation also reveals the courage of the faithful. Despite ridicule, they &#8220;had a mind to work&#8221; (<a href="/nehemiah/4-6.htm">Nehemiah 4:6</a>). Their perseverance mirrors Jesus, who &#8220;endured hostility from sinners&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/4-5.htm">Nehemiah 4:5</a> is a candid plea for God&#8217;s justice: &#8220;Do not cover up their iniquity or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight, for they have provoked the builders.&#8221; Faced with relentless opposition, Nehemiah entrusts vengeance to the Lord, asking Him to expose sin, refuse premature pardon, and defend those laboring for His purposes. The verse reminds believers that God sees every effort to hinder His work, holds evildoers accountable, and strengthens His people to keep building even amid mockery and threat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cover not their iniquity</span>, etc. Some of David's imprecations are very similar (<a href="/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7, 14, 15</a>, etc.), as also some of Jeremiah's (<a href="/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They have provoked thee to anger before the builders</span>.
