Nehemiah, as the leader, sets an example of diligence and vigilance. The mention of "brothers" and "servants" indicates a close-knit community working together for a common cause. This reflects the communal effort seen throughout the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, emphasizing the importance of leadership and teamwork in achieving God's purposes. The guards' presence underscores the constant threat from adversaries, a theme prevalent in Nehemiah's narrative, where opposition from surrounding nations is a recurring challenge.<p><b>changed out of our clothes</b><br>This indicates a state of readiness and alertness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, changing clothes was often associated with rest or relaxation. By not changing, Nehemiah and his team demonstrate their continuous preparedness to defend against any sudden attack. This vigilance is reminiscent of the New Testament exhortation to be spiritually alert, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where believers are urged to be sober-minded and watchful.<p><b>each carried his weapon</b><br>The carrying of weapons signifies the tangible threat faced by the builders and the necessity of being prepared for battle at any moment. This dual focus on building and defense is a practical response to the opposition from figures like Sanballat and Tobiah, who sought to disrupt the work. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to build the kingdom of God while also being equipped to stand against spiritual adversaries, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a> with the armor of God.<p><b>even to go for water</b><br>This detail underscores the constant vigilance required, as even routine tasks like fetching water were not exempt from the need for protection. Water, a basic necessity, symbolizes life and sustenance, and the need to be armed even during such tasks highlights the pervasive danger. This can be paralleled with the Christian's call to be prepared in all aspects of life, maintaining spiritual readiness in both mundane and significant moments. The vigilance in Nehemiah's time serves as a reminder of the persistent nature of spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah was a cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes and later became the governor of Jerusalem.

His &#8220;brothers&#8221; likely include both blood relatives and fellow Jewish leaders (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a>; 5:14). The unity of leadership under God&#8217;s call is essential; <a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a> celebrates brothers dwelling in unity, and <a href="/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a> urges believers to be &#8220;like-minded, having the same love.&#8221; Here, unity is demonstrated not in comfort but in shared hardship for God&#8217;s work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor my servants</b><p>Even the household attendants accept inconvenient vigilance. True service in God&#8217;s kingdom is never beneath anyone, whether ruler or servant (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-44</a>). This mirrors <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.&#8221; Everyone attached to Nehemiah embraces the same spiritual and physical discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor the guards with me</b><p>These men were specifically tasked with protection, yet they follow the same rigorous standard. Leadership that models commitment inspires those under authority (<a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>). In <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-31</a> Paul warns elders to &#8220;keep watch,&#8221; a parallel to these guards whose alertness preserves community safety.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Changed out of our clothes</b><p>The workers slept in their gear, ready for immediate response. <a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a> urges believers to &#8220;put on the full armor of God&#8221; so that, when the day of evil comes, they may stand their ground. Just as changing clothes would leave a vulnerable gap, dropping spiritual disciplines leaves believers exposed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each carried his weapon</b><p>Readiness is personal, not delegated. While Nehemiah organized the defense, every individual accepted responsibility (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>; <a href="/luke/22-36.htm">Luke 22:36</a>). Spiritually, every believer must wield &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>). Collective security grows from individual preparedness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even to go for water</b><p>Routine tasks did not excuse vigilance. <a href="/judges/7-5.htm">Judges 7:5-7</a> records Gideon&#8217;s soldiers being tested by how they drank water; alertness in the mundane identifies true warriors. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a> reminds us that &#8220;whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God,&#8221; including the simplest chores.

Believers today are called to the same continuous readiness&#8212;clothed in Christ, equipped with His Word, faithful in every task, large or small.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Saving that every one put them off for washing.</span>--This rendering is very improbable, as the words are simply: "every man his weapon water." Some interpret that "each man's weapon was his water": evidently too subtle a turn of thought. It is best, on the whole, to supply the ellipsis: "every man went with his weapon to the water."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My brethren</span>. Actual brothers probably. That Nehemiah had brothers appears from <a href="/nehemiah/1-2.htm">Nehemiah 1:2</a>; that one of them, Hanani, had accompanied him to Jerusalem is evident from <a href="/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span>.

As governor, Nehemiah would maintain a body-guard, in addition to his band of slaves. <span class="cmt_word">Saving that every one put them off for washing</span>. So the Vulgate: "Unnsquisque tantum nudabatur ad baptismum;" but it is at least doubtful whether the Hebrew words can possibly have this meaning. The most natural and literal sense of them is that given by Maurer and Rambach - "Each man's weapon was his water;" the supposed connection of the clause with the preceding being, "No one took off his clothes," not even for the bath - no one bathed; "a man's only bath was his weapon." Some critics, however, defend the rendering of the A. V.; others take the words in the same way, but explain the term "water" differently, of a natural want (Ewald, Stanley); while many regard the text as unsound, and propose emendations. None, however, that has as yet been proposed is satisfactory. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So neither I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">nor brothers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
