Sanballat was the governor of Samaria, Tobiah was an Ammonite official, and Geshem was an influential Arab leader. Their opposition represents the broader resistance from surrounding nations against the Jewish community's restoration efforts. This opposition is a recurring theme in Nehemiah, highlighting the challenges faced by God's people in fulfilling His purposes. The mention of "enemies" underscores the spiritual and physical opposition believers often encounter, reminiscent of <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, which speaks of spiritual warfare.<p><b>that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left</b><br>The completion of the wall, except for the gates, signifies a significant achievement in Nehemiah's mission. The wall's restoration symbolizes protection and the re-establishment of Jerusalem as a fortified city. This accomplishment is a testament to Nehemiah's leadership and the people's unity and determination. The phrase "not a gap was left" indicates thoroughness and completeness, reflecting the biblical principle of doing God's work with excellence (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The wall's completion also fulfills part of the prophecy in <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a> regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<p><b>though to that time I had not yet installed the doors in the gates</b><br>The absence of the doors in the gates suggests that while the wall was structurally complete, the city was not yet fully secure. Gates were crucial for controlling access and ensuring the city's safety. This detail highlights the ongoing nature of Nehemiah's work and the need for vigilance even after significant progress. It serves as a reminder of the importance of perseverance and completing the tasks God sets before us (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The gates can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the "gate" or "door" through which believers enter into salvation (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, Nehemiah is a Jewish leader who is instrumental in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.

By identifying these adversaries, the text reminds us that God&#8217;s work often draws recognizable resistance (<a href="/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10, 19</a>; 4:7).<p>&#8226; Their organized hostility echoes <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a> &#8211; &#8220;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?&#8221;. God&#8217;s people should not be surprised when opposition unites against them (<a href="/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Listing each enemy underscores the personal nature of the attack. It is not abstract opposition; real people are invested in stopping God&#8217;s plan, just as Pharaoh opposed Moses (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>) and Haman targeted the Jews (<a href="/esther/3-5.htm">Esther 3:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard that I had rebuilt the wall</b><p>&#8226; Word of Jerusalem&#8217;s restoration spreads quickly, emphasizing how visible obedience to God becomes public testimony (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The wall&#8217;s completion marks a victory of perseverance over intimidation (<a href="/nehemiah/4-8.htm">Nehemiah 4:8-9</a>). God&#8217;s faithfulness enables His servants to finish tasks others assume impossible (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Hearing of progress often provokes fresh schemes from opponents. Similar patterns emerge in <a href="/ezra/4-4.htm">Ezra 4:4-5</a>, where adversaries &#8220;hired counselors against them to frustrate their plans&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and not a gap was left</b><p>&#8226; This phrase celebrates thoroughness. Nehemiah&#8217;s team did not settle for partial obedience; they pursued excellence (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; A gap-free wall symbolizes spiritual integrity&#8212;no compromised areas for the enemy to exploit (<a href="/ephesians/4-27.htm">Ephesians 4:27</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>, Jericho&#8217;s walls fell completely; here, Jerusalem&#8217;s walls stand completely.

Gates without doors leave the city vulnerable. The enemy seeks a foothold in these final details (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Finishing well matters. Solomon began strong but faltered later (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). Nehemiah models diligence until every piece, even the &#8220;small&#8221; doors, is secured (<a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Gates are places of authority and decision (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>).

God&#8217;s enemies notice tangible progress and intensify their pressure. Yet Nehemiah&#8217;s careful record shows that complete obedience, continued vigilance, and finishing every last task are essential for God&#8217;s people.

The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> is repeated with Geshem, but not with Tobiah, probably because Tobiah was Sanballat's subordinate, but Geshem an independent chief. Hence, too, it was not proposed that Tobiah should be at the conference. <span class="cmt_word">At that time I had not set up the doors</span>. This may appear to contradict <a href="/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1, 3, 6, 13</a>, etc. But the account of the building in ch. 3. is carried on to the completion of the whole work, the object there being to state by whom the different parts were done, and not at what time. Chronologically, chs. 4, 5, and 6. are parallel to ch. 3, relating events that happened while the wall was being built. The hanging of the doors in the gateways was, naturally, the last thing done. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the gates</span>. Rather, "in the gateways." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;a&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
