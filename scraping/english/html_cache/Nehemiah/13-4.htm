It suggests a period of neglect or compromise in the spiritual and communal life of the Israelites, which Nehemiah sought to address.<p><b>Eliashib the priest</b><br>Eliashib was the high priest during Nehemiah's time. His role was significant, as the high priest was responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the temple and leading the people in worship. His actions, therefore, had a profound impact on the spiritual state of the nation. The mention of Eliashib highlights the failure of religious leadership, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where leaders often fall short of God's standards.<p><b>a relative of Tobiah</b><br>Tobiah was an Ammonite official and one of Nehemiah's adversaries, as seen in earlier chapters. The relationship between Eliashib and Tobiah suggests a compromise with foreign influences, which was contrary to the Law of Moses that prohibited alliances with non-Israelites (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>). This connection underscores the theme of spiritual compromise and the dangers of forming alliances with those opposed to God's purposes.<p><b>had been put in charge of the storerooms</b><br>The storerooms in the temple were meant for storing offerings, tithes, and other sacred items necessary for temple worship. Eliashib's appointment to oversee these storerooms indicates a position of trust and responsibility. However, his misuse of this position, as later verses reveal, reflects a broader issue of corruption and neglect of God's commands, which Nehemiah had to rectify.<p><b>of the house of our God</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the sacredness of the temple, which was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The temple's sanctity was paramount, and any defilement or misuse of its facilities was a serious offense. This underscores the importance of holiness and purity in worship, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who cleanses and sanctifies His people (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliashib_the_priest.htm">Eliashib the Priest</a></b><br>Eliashib was a high priest in Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah.
