It was named for its use in bringing sheep into the city for sacrifices. This gate's mention first highlights its spiritual significance, as it was directly connected to temple worship. The Sheep Gate's restoration symbolizes the priority of worship and sacrifice in the community's life. In a typological sense, the Sheep Gate can be seen as a representation of Christ, the Lamb of God, who is the ultimate sacrifice for sin (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests began rebuilding</b><br>Eliashib was the high priest during Nehemiah's time, a position of significant religious authority. The involvement of the high priest and other priests in the rebuilding effort underscores the spiritual leadership's commitment to the physical and spiritual restoration of Jerusalem. Their participation also highlights the unity between religious and civic duties. This act of rebuilding by the priests can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), called to build up the spiritual house of God.<p><b>They dedicated it and installed its doors</b><br>The dedication of the gate and the installation of its doors signify the completion and consecration of the work to God. Dedication in the biblical context often involves setting something apart for God's purposes, indicating that the work was not merely a physical task but a spiritual act of worship. The installation of doors represents security and protection, essential for the city's defense and the safeguarding of its inhabitants. This act of dedication parallels the Christian life, where believers are called to dedicate themselves to God and live securely within His protection (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>After building as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel</b><br>The Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel were significant structures in Jerusalem's fortifications. The Tower of the Hundred may have been named for a military unit stationed there, while the Tower of Hananel is mentioned in other scriptures (<a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>, <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>) as a landmark in the city's northern wall. These towers provided strategic defense points and were crucial for the city's security. Their mention emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the rebuilding effort, ensuring that all parts of the wall were fortified. The restoration of these towers can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance and readiness, akin to the call for believers to be watchful and prepared (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>).<p><b>They dedicated the wall</b><br>The dedication of the wall signifies the completion of the rebuilding project and the community's commitment to God. This act of dedication is a public acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and provision. It reflects the biblical principle of dedicating all endeavors to the Lord, recognizing His role in granting success (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>). The wall's dedication also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to restore and protect His people, a theme echoed throughout scripture and ultimately fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliashib_the_high_priest.htm">Eliashib the High Priest</a></b><br>Eliashib was the high priest during the time of Nehemiah.

This being built, "they sanctified it," as an earnest of the subsequent consecration of the entire wall. Their work and the sanctification of it extended to two towns near each other at the north-east corner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up</span>. It is satisfactory to find Eliashib the high priest taking the part which befitted him on this occasion. Subsequently we find him "allied by marriage to Tobiah (<a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), and guilty of a profanation of the temple (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 5). By the line of high priests given in <a href="/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of the Jeshua who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his brethren</span>. The priests generally. Compare ver. 28, which shows that the priests undertook a portion of the eastern wall, besides the work here mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">Builded the sheep gate</span>. The "sheep gate" appears to have been a gate in the eastern wall, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of St. John (John %;2), which was close to the pool of Bethesda. By this gate were brought in the sheep needed for sacrifice, which were then washed in the adjoining pool, and conveyed from it into the temple area, whereon the pool abuts. The priests dwelt principally in this portion of the city. <span class="cmt_word">They sanctified it</span>. This appears to have been a dedication quite distinct from that which is described in <a href="/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>. The priests, having completed the rebuilding of the sheep gate, and of the wall extending from it northwards as far as the tower of Hananeel, anticipated the general dedication by a special one, which "sanctified," or consecrated, their own portion of the wall Thus a sacred character was impressed on the work at the earliest possible moment, and it was placed under the protection of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Meah</span> (or rather Hammeah, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Hundred") and <span class="cmt_word">the tower of Hananeel</span> appear to have been situated almost at the same point of the wall. Perhaps they were opposite each other, like the towers in the walls of Babylon (Herod., 1:179). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the Sheep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1488;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
