In the biblical context, it echoes the prayers of other faithful servants like Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/8-28.htm">1 Kings 8:28</a>) and David (<a href="/psalms/17-6.htm">Psalm 17:6</a>), who also sought God's attentive ear. It underscores the belief that God is personal and responsive to the prayers of His people.<p><b>and to the prayers of Your servants who delight to revere Your name.</b><br>This highlights the communal aspect of prayer, emphasizing that Nehemiah is not alone in his devotion. The term "servants" suggests a collective of faithful individuals who find joy in honoring God's name, similar to the remnant in <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>. Reverence for God's name is a central theme in Scripture, pointing to a life lived in awe and respect for His holiness.<p><b>Give Your servant success this day, I pray,</b><br>Nehemiah's request for success is specific and immediate, showing his dependence on God for the task ahead. The phrase "this day" indicates urgency and faith in God's timely intervention. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>, where committing one's plans to the Lord leads to success.<p><b>and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.&#8221;</b><br>Nehemiah seeks favor from the king, recognizing that human authority is ultimately under God's control. This reflects the biblical theme of God granting favor to His people in the eyes of rulers, as seen with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a> and Daniel in <a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>. It underscores the belief that God can influence the hearts of leaders for His purposes.<p><b>(At that time I was the cupbearer to the king.)</b><br>This provides historical context, identifying Nehemiah's position of influence and trust in the Persian court. The role of a cupbearer was significant, involving close proximity to the king and responsibility for his safety. This position parallels Joseph's role in Egypt, where God used a strategic placement to fulfill His plans (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>).

He knows success comes only from God, who can turn a pagan king&#8217;s heart to advance His redemptive plan for Jerusalem and, ultimately, for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prosper thy servant this day</span>. "This day" does not perhaps mean more than "at this time"- in connection with this matter which is now in my thoughts. And grant him mercy in the sight of this man. "This man" is, of course, Artaxerxes, though as yet he has not been named. Nehemiah's thoughts have far outstripped his words. He has made up his mind that, in order to remove the reproach of Jerusalem, he must go there in person; that, to do so, he must obtain the king's permission; and that, to get his permission, he needs to be in very special favour with him. All depending on one man only, he has one man only in his mind, who becomes to him, therefore, "this man." <span class="cmt_word">I was the king's cupbearer</span>. Literally, "I was cupbearer to the king." Not his sole cupbearer, but one of many. He mentions the fact here, partly to explain the meaning of "this man" to the reader, partly because it was his office which would give him access to Artaxerxes, and enable him to profit by the royal "mercy" or favour. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">O Lord,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_136.htm">Strong's 136: </a> </span><span class="str2">The Lord</span><br /><br /><span class="word">may Your ear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1469;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
