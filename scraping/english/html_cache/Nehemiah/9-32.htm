The use of "our" signifies a collective identity and unity among the people of Israel. It reflects the communal nature of prayer and repentance in Jewish tradition, where the community often seeks God's intervention together.<p><b>the great and mighty and awesome God</b><br>These attributes highlight God's sovereignty and power. "Great" and "mighty" are often used in the Old Testament to describe God's ability to perform miracles and deliver His people (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>). "Awesome" reflects the reverence and fear that God's presence inspires, as seen in the reactions of those who encountered Him (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>).<p><b>who keeps His gracious covenant</b><br>This refers to the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants, where God promised to be faithful to His people. The term "gracious" underscores God's mercy and steadfast love, even when Israel was unfaithful. The covenant is a central theme in the Bible, illustrating God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His promises (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).<p><b>do not view lightly all the hardship that has come upon us</b><br>The plea for God not to overlook their suffering acknowledges the severity of their situation. This reflects the biblical theme of lament, where believers express their distress and seek God's intervention (e.g., Psalms 13:1-2). It also implies a belief in God's justice and His ability to change their circumstances.<p><b>and upon our kings and leaders, our priests and prophets</b><br>This list includes all levels of society, indicating that the hardships affected everyone, from rulers to religious leaders. It suggests a collective responsibility and the need for communal repentance. The inclusion of "priests and prophets" highlights the spiritual dimension of their struggles, as these figures were responsible for guiding the people in God's ways.<p><b>our ancestors and all Your people</b><br>This phrase connects the current generation with their forebears, acknowledging a history of disobedience and suffering. It reflects the biblical concept of corporate identity, where the actions of one generation impact the next (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). It also emphasizes the continuity of God's people throughout history.<p><b>from the days of the kings of Assyria until today</b><br>This historical reference points to the Assyrian conquest and exile, a period of great turmoil for Israel (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). It underscores the long duration of their suffering and the need for divine intervention. The mention of Assyria serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the hope for restoration through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish leader who played a crucial role in rebuilding Jerusalem's walls and leading spiritual renewal among the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Referred to as "the great, mighty, and awesome God," emphasizing His power and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_assyria.htm">Kings of Assyria</a></b><br>Historical rulers who oppressed Israel, leading to significant hardship and exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who experienced suffering and exile due to their disobedience but are now seeking restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred agreement between God and His people, highlighting His steadfast love and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's repeated failures, God remains faithful to His covenant.

They ask Him to notice their suffering&#8212;shared by rulers, priests, prophets, ancestors, and the present generation&#8212;stretching back to Assyrian times.

Compare <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, with the comment. <span class="cmt_word">Who keepest covenant and mercy</span>. This phrase, which occurs also in <a href="/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>, has apparently been derived from the Psalmist's words - "My <span class="accented">mercy</span> will I <span class="accented">keep</span> for him for evermore, and my <span class="accented">covenant</span> shall stand fast with him" (<a href="/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the trouble</span>. Literally, "the weariness;" but the word is clearly used here for "suffering" generally. <span class="cmt_word">Since the time of the kings of Assyria</span>. The kings of Assyria, in the strictest sense of the word, had been God's original instrument for punishing his rebellious people. A king not mentioned in Holy Scripture tells us that he defeated Ahab, and forced Jehu to pay him tribute. Another (Pul) took tribute from Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19, 20</a>). A third (Tiglath. Pfieser) carried two tribes and a half into captivity (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>). A fourth (Shalmaneser) laid siege to Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and a fifth (Sargon) took it. A sixth (Sennacherib) took all the fenced cities of Judah from Hezekiah, and forced him to buy the safety of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>). A seventh (Esar-haddon) had Manasseh brought as a prisoner to Babylon (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). Hence Isaiah calls the Assyrian monarch "the rod of God's anger" (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
