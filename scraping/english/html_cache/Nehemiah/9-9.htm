The "affliction" includes the harsh labor and oppression described in <a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>. God's seeing implies His compassion and readiness to act, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where He tells Moses He has seen the misery of His people. This reflects God's omniscience and His covenant faithfulness to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The historical context is the period of the Egyptian bondage, which lasted approximately 400 years, fulfilling the prophecy given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>. This affliction is a type of the spiritual bondage from which Christ delivers believers.<p><b>You heard their cry at the Red Sea.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's responsiveness to the desperate pleas of the Israelites as they faced the Egyptian army at the Red Sea, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10-12</a>. The "cry" signifies a moment of intense fear and helplessness, yet it also demonstrates faith in God's deliverance. God's hearing is an assurance of His presence and intervention, as He miraculously parted the Red Sea, allowing the Israelites to escape (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). This event is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and deliverance, and is often seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's redemptive work, where He leads believers from death to life. The Red Sea crossing is also referenced in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>, as a type of baptism and spiritual deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The central figure who sees and hears the plight of His people, demonstrating His omniscience and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>- Referred to as "our fathers," they are the people of God who were oppressed in Egypt and cried out for deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The place of bondage and oppression for the Israelites, symbolizing a state of spiritual and physical captivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>- The location of a miraculous deliverance where God parted the waters for the Israelites to escape from the Egyptian army.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the leader through whom God orchestrated the deliverance of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_compassion.htm">God's Omniscience and Compassion</a></b><br>God is fully aware of our struggles and hears our cries.
