The work was organized in sections, with each group responsible for a specific part. This reflects the unity and shared purpose among the Israelites, reminiscent of the body of Christ working together in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>Shallum son of Hallohesh</b><br>Shallum is identified by his lineage, which was a common practice in biblical times to establish identity and credibility. Hallohesh is not widely mentioned elsewhere, suggesting that Shallum's significance comes from his role in the rebuilding rather than his ancestry. This highlights the importance of individual contributions to God's work, regardless of one's background.<p><b>ruler of the other half-district of Jerusalem</b><br>This indicates Shallum's position of authority and responsibility. Jerusalem was divided into districts for administrative purposes, and Shallum was a leader of one such district. His involvement in the repairs shows the commitment of leaders to the physical and spiritual restoration of the city, paralleling the role of leaders in the church today (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><b>made repairs</b><br>The act of making repairs signifies restoration and renewal. In the context of Nehemiah, it represents the physical rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls, which also symbolizes spiritual renewal and protection. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who restores and rebuilds the brokenness in our lives (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-4</a>).<p><b>with the help of his daughters</b><br>The mention of Shallum's daughters is significant, as it highlights the involvement of women in the rebuilding process, which was unusual in the patriarchal society of ancient Israel. This inclusion underscores the theme of inclusivity in God's work, where all are called to participate, reflecting <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, which speaks of unity in Christ regardless of gender.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum.htm">Shallum</a></b><br>A leader in Jerusalem, specifically a ruler of a half-district, who took an active role in the rebuilding of the wall.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hallohesh.htm">Hallohesh</a></b><br>The father of Shallum, mentioned to establish lineage and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the wall was being rebuilt, central to Jewish identity and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shallum's_daughters.htm">Shallum's Daughters</a></b><br>Notable for their involvement in the construction work, highlighting the role of women in this significant project.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wall_of_jerusalem.htm">The Wall of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The focus of the rebuilding efforts, symbolizing protection, identity, and the restoration of the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Shallum, as a leader, sets an example by actively participating in the work.

This rhythm underscores shoulder-to-shoulder cooperation, showing that God&#8217;s people advance best in unity (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18-27</a>; <a href="/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase literally places Shallum&#8217;s team beside the previous crew, reminding us that every task&#8212;however small or large&#8212;matters in the larger plan, just as each stone fit beside another formed Jerusalem&#8217;s protection (cf. <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shallum son of Hallohesh</b><p>&#8226; Scripture names real people, rooting the narrative in history and accountability. Shallum&#8217;s inclusion honors faithfulness much like <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> lists those who &#8220;obtained a good testimony through faith&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>).<p>&#8226; His father&#8217;s name is preserved, affirming family legacy and godly heritage (cf. <a href="/proverbs/22-1.htm">Proverbs 22:1</a>). When we serve, we also write a record for those who come after us (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ruler of the other half-district of Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Leadership is not detached from labor. This civic official rolls up his sleeves, modeling servant leadership that mirrors Jesus, who &#8220;came not to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;other half-district&#8221; shows organized stewardship&#8212;Jerusalem was divided for efficient oversight. God values order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>) and expects leaders to engage, not merely delegate (cf. <a href="/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3-4</a>, for civil servants as ministers of God).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Made repairs</b><p>&#8226; The verb highlights tangible action; faith expresses itself through work (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). Rebuilding the wall protected worship, families, and witness&#8212;illustrating how spiritual restoration often begins with practical obedience (cf. <a href="/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Every stone set proclaimed confidence in God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/nehemiah/2-20.htm">Nehemiah 2:20</a>), just as obedience today testifies that &#8220;He who promised is faithful&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With the help of his daughters</b><p>&#8226; This brief note bursts with significance: women actively strengthened the wall. Like Miriam leading worship (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>), Deborah judging Israel (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4-5</a>), and Philip&#8217;s prophesying daughters (<a href="/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), these young women stepped into God-ordained service.<p>&#8226; Family participation passes faith to the next generation (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). Shallum&#8217;s household models <a href="/proverbs/31-27.htm">Proverbs 31:27</a>&#8212;watchful diligence that blesses the city and honors the Lord.<p>&#8226; Their inclusion rebukes any notion that kingdom work is reserved for a select few; &#8220;there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/3-12.htm">Nehemiah 3:12</a> spotlights unified effort, personal accountability, servant leadership, hands-on obedience, and multigenerational participation. Shallum&#8212;a district ruler&#8212;stood beside fellow builders, repaired his assigned section, and brought his daughters into the work. The verse quietly celebrates how God weaves every willing heart, regardless of position or gender, into His redemptive construction project. Our own families and churches are called to the same shoulder-to-shoulder faithfulness until every gap is filled and the praise of God resounds within secure walls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">He and his daughters.</span>--Shallum was governor of the second half-district around Jerusalem; and it has been thought that the "daughters" here are the villages of the district.

It seems to be almost impossible that women were pressed into the service, especially when it was one of so much danger (<a href="/nehemiah/4-13.htm">Nehemiah 4:13-21</a>).
