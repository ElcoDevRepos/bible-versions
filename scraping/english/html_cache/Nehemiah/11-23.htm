The king referred to here is likely Artaxerxes I of Persia, under whose reign Nehemiah served as cupbearer and later governor of Judah. This highlights the Persian influence and support in the restoration of Jerusalem, as seen in Ezra and Nehemiah. The king's command underscores the political and administrative structure that allowed the Jewish community to reestablish their religious practices.<p><b>concerning the singers</b><br>The singers were Levites assigned to lead worship in the temple, a role established by King David (1 Chronicles 25). Their inclusion in the king's command emphasizes the importance of worship and music in Jewish religious life. The singers' duties were not only ceremonial but also spiritual, as they helped maintain the community's focus on God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of worship as central to the life of God's people, seen in Psalms and Revelation.<p><b>an ordinance regulating their daily activities</b><br>This ordinance ensured the singers' needs were met, allowing them to focus on their spiritual duties without distraction. It reflects the organized and systematic approach to temple worship, reminiscent of the detailed instructions given for the tabernacle and temple services in the Torah. The daily activities of the singers were crucial for maintaining the rhythm of worship, paralleling the daily sacrifices and prayers.

David had earlier organized singers &#8220;to minister before the ark of the Lord, to proclaim, to give thanks, and to praise&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; By specifying singers, the king&#8217;s command acknowledges their spiritual and communal value, echoing the biblical principle that God &#8220;inhabits the praises of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An ordinance</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;ordinance&#8221; highlights that the command became permanent policy, not a one-time subsidy. It established a legal framework ensuring sustained worship.<p>&#8226; Comparable ordinances had existed under David and Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14-15</a>), and their revival demonstrates continuity between pre-exile and post-exile worship patterns.<p>&#8226; This arrangement reflects God&#8217;s desire for ordered, not haphazard, praise&#8212;&#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order&#8221; (1 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 14</a>:40).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Regulating their daily activities</b><p>&#8226; The ordinance provided daily provisions&#8212;likely food allowances or financial support&#8212;so singers could devote themselves fully to ministry (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44-47</a>).<p>&#8226; This principle parallels the New Testament teaching that &#8220;those who proclaim the gospel should live from the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Regular, dependable support safeguarded consistency in worship, preventing neglect similar to the lapse corrected in <a href="/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10-12</a> when Levites had to abandon temple service to earn a living.<p>&#8226; The daily rhythm of praise foreshadowed the unceasing worship of heaven, where &#8220;they never stop saying, &#8216;Holy, holy, holy&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nehemiah/11-23.htm">Nehemiah 11:23</a> reveals God&#8217;s meticulous care for worship: He moves a secular king to issue a binding decree that guarantees daily provision for temple singers. By legislating continual praise, the Lord secures an ordered, God-honoring environment in Jerusalem, reminding believers that He remains sovereign over governments, values dedicated worship leaders, and expects His people to support those who minister so that praise may rise to Him without interruption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nehemiah/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">The king's commandment.</span>--It seems that Artaxerxes had gone beyond the exemption of <a href="/ezra/7-24.htm" title="Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, on them.">Ezra 7:24</a>, and given them a daily allowance, which it was the business of Uzzi to see to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it was the king's commandment concerning them</span>.
