This phrase indicates the community's approval and gratitude. Blessing in the Old Testament often involved speaking words of encouragement and invoking divine favor, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham. The act of blessing here reflects a communal acknowledgment of sacrifice and service.<p><b>all the men who volunteered</b><br>Volunteering to live in Jerusalem was a significant decision, as the city was still in a state of rebuilding and faced potential threats from surrounding enemies. This act of volunteering demonstrates a commitment to the restoration of the city and the worship of God at the temple. The willingness to volunteer can be seen as an act of faith and dedication, similar to the call for workers in the harvest in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>. The men who volunteered were likely seen as courageous and selfless, prioritizing the needs of the community over personal comfort.<p><b>to live in Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem, the city of David, held great historical and spiritual significance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the temple. Living in Jerusalem meant being at the heart of religious and cultural life, but it also involved risks due to the city's vulnerable state post-exile. The decision to reside there was not merely practical but also spiritual, aligning with God's promises to restore Jerusalem as seen in <a href="/isaiah/62.htm">Isaiah 62:1-7</a>. The rebuilding of Jerusalem is a type of the ultimate restoration found in Christ, who is the cornerstone of the new Jerusalem, as referenced in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah who led the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls and initiated reforms to restore the city both physically and spiritually.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Judah who were involved in the rebuilding efforts and the repopulation of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The holy city of the Jews, which had been in ruins and was being restored as the center of Jewish life and worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/volunteers.htm">Volunteers</a></b><br>The men who willingly chose to live in Jerusalem, despite the challenges, to ensure the city's restoration and protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing.htm">Blessing</a></b><br>The act of the people expressing gratitude and approval for those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_willingness.htm">The Importance of Willingness</a></b><br>The volunteers' decision to live in Jerusalem demonstrates the value of a willing heart in serving God's purposes.
