The setting is post-exilic Jerusalem, where the Israelites, having returned from Babylonian captivity, are re-establishing their religious and cultural identity. The reading likely took place at the Water Gate, a significant location in Jerusalem, symbolizing the accessibility of God's Word to all people. This public reading echoes the command in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm">Deuteronomy 31:11-13</a>, where Moses instructed that the Law be read to all Israel during the Feast of Tabernacles. It underscores the importance of Scripture in guiding the community and maintaining covenantal faithfulness.<p><b>explaining it and giving insight</b><br>The Levites and possibly Ezra himself were responsible for explaining the Law, ensuring that the people understood its meaning and implications. This process involved translating the Hebrew text into Aramaic, the common language of the people at the time, and providing interpretation. This practice is akin to expository preaching, where the text is read, explained, and applied. The need for explanation highlights the gap between the ancient text and the contemporary audience, a challenge that persists in biblical interpretation today. This act of explanation is reminiscent of Jesus' own teaching ministry, where He often explained the Scriptures to His disciples (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>).<p><b>so that the people could understand what was being read</b><br>Understanding was the ultimate goal of the reading and explanation. The emphasis on comprehension indicates that the Law was not merely to be heard but to be internalized and acted upon. This aligns with the biblical principle that faith comes from hearing the Word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The people's understanding would lead to a renewed commitment to the covenant, as seen later in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8 and 9</a>, where the people respond with worship and confession. This understanding is a precursor to the New Covenant, where the law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>), fulfilled in Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ezra.htm">Ezra</a></b><br>A scribe and priest who played a central role in the spiritual renewal of the Israelites.
