The "gracious hand of my God" signifies God's providence and blessing, a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God's hand represents His power and support (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 9</a>). Nehemiah's success in gaining the king's favor is attributed to God's intervention, emphasizing the belief that God orchestrates events for His purposes. This reflects the biblical principle that God empowers His servants to accomplish His will, as seen in the lives of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>).<p><b>and what the king had said to me</b><br>Nehemiah refers to his conversation with King Artaxerxes, where the king granted him permission to return to Jerusalem and rebuild its walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2.htm">Nehemiah 2:1-8</a>). This is significant because it shows the fulfillment of God's promise to restore Jerusalem, aligning with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God declares that Jerusalem will be rebuilt. The king's support also underscores the theme of God using secular authorities to achieve His divine plans, as seen with Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Let us start rebuilding,&#8221; they replied</b><br>The response of the people indicates their readiness and willingness to participate in the rebuilding effort. This collective enthusiasm reflects a unified community spirit, essential for the success of such a monumental task. It also demonstrates the effective leadership of Nehemiah, who inspired confidence and action among the people. This mirrors the call to unity and cooperation found in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>, where believers are urged to be united in purpose.<p><b>and they set their hands to this good work</b><br>The phrase signifies the commencement of the rebuilding project, highlighting the people's commitment and determination. The term "good work" implies that the task is not only beneficial but also divinely sanctioned. This aligns with the biblical concept that work done in accordance with God's will is inherently good (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). The rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls is a type of Christ's redemptive work, as both involve restoration and protection of God's people. The physical rebuilding foreshadows the spiritual restoration brought by Jesus, who rebuilds lives and communities through His sacrifice and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nehemiah.htm">Nehemiah</a></b><br>A Jewish cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes, who is moved by God to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The Jewish inhabitants who respond to Nehemiah's call to rebuild the city's walls.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Artaxerxes)</a></b><br>The Persian ruler who grants Nehemiah permission and resources to rebuild Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city whose walls are in ruins, symbolizing the broken state of the Jewish community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gracious_hand_of_god.htm">The Gracious Hand of God</a></b><br>A phrase indicating God's favor and providence in Nehemiah's mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_favor_in_leadership.htm">God's Favor in Leadership</a></b><br>Nehemiah's success begins with recognizing God's gracious hand.
