Mountains often symbolize strength and permanence in the Bible, and here they serve as a backdrop for the arrival of good news. In the context of Nahum, the mountains could refer to the hills surrounding Jerusalem, emphasizing the protection and stability God provides.<p><b>the feet of one who brings good news,</b><br>The imagery of feet bringing good news is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> and <a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>, where it is associated with the proclamation of salvation and peace. In Nahum, this good news is the impending downfall of Nineveh, the oppressive Assyrian capital, which signifies deliverance for Judah. The feet symbolize the swiftness and certainty of God's message.<p><b>who proclaims peace!</b><br>Peace here refers to the cessation of Assyrian oppression and the restoration of security and order for Judah. Biblically, peace (shalom) encompasses wholeness and well-being, not just the absence of conflict. This proclamation foreshadows the ultimate peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p><b>Celebrate your feasts, O Judah;</b><br>The call to celebrate feasts indicates a return to religious normalcy and joy. Under Assyrian threat, such celebrations may have been neglected. The feasts, including Passover and Tabernacles, were central to Jewish worship and identity, reminding the people of God's past deliverance and covenant promises.<p><b>fulfill your vows.</b><br>Vows in the Old Testament were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress. The fulfillment of vows signifies gratitude and renewed commitment to God following deliverance. This call encourages Judah to respond to God's salvation with faithfulness and worship.<p><b>For the wicked will never again march through you;</b><br>The "wicked" refers to the Assyrians, known for their brutality and conquest. This assurance of their permanent removal is a promise of divine justice and protection. Historically, Nineveh fell in 612 BC, and Assyria ceased to be a threat, fulfilling this prophecy.<p><b>they will be utterly cut off.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the totality of Assyria's destruction. It reflects God's sovereignty and justice, ensuring that oppressors will not prevail indefinitely. This complete cutting off also prefigures the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's victory, as seen in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet whose name means "comfort" or "consolation."

The verse celebrates God&#8217;s unbreakable promise to rescue His people, previews the gospel&#8217;s good news of ultimate peace in Christ, and assures believers that every wicked power will one day be completely cut off.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nahum/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Behold upon the mountains.</span>--It is not plain why this verse has been made the first of Nahum 3 in the Hebrew. It is evidently the finale of the proclamation against the Assyrian invader, and rightly stands in the LXX. as the last verse of Nahum 2. It portrays the announcement of Sennacherib's fate to the towns and villages of Judah. "From mountain-top to mountain-top by beacon fires they spread the glad tidings. Suddenly the deliverance comes, sudden its announcement. <span class= "ital">Behold,</span> Judah, before hindered by armies from going up to Jerusalem, its cities taken, may now again <span class= "ital">keep the feasts</span> there, and <span class= "ital">pay the vows</span> which in trouble she promised; <span class= "ital">for the wicked one,</span> the ungodly Sennacherib, <span class= "ital">is utterly cut off; he shall no more pass through thee</span>" (Pusey). The opening clause necessarily reminds one of the description of deliverance in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm" title="How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace; that brings good tidings of good, that publishes salvation; that said to Zion, Your God reigns!">Isaiah 52:7</a>. The one author probably borrows the language of the other; but which passage we regard as the original must depend on the view taken of the Book of Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - The second chapter commences here in the Hebrew and Syriac; the Anglican follows the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Chaldee Versions. This seems most agreeable to the method of the prophecy, wherein threat is succeeded by promise, denunciation of the enemy by declaration of comfort to Judah (comp. <a href="/nahum/1-6.htm">Nahum 1:6, 7, 12</a>, and 13; so here vers. 14 and 15). The prophet announces the joy with which Judah receives the news of the overthrow of Nineveh. <span class="cmt_word">Behold upon the mountains,</span> etc. Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>) uses these words to proclaim the coming of Messiah (comp. <a href="/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a>; <a href="/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>). The messengers come from the East across the mountains of Palestine, announcing the fall of Nineveh and the consequent peace and security of Judah - a type of the overthrow of God's enemies and the safety of his Church. There may be an allusion to the custom of spreading tidings by beacon fires. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy solemn feasts.</span> Judah is exhorted to resume the observation of her solemnities, which were interrupted during the enemy's occupation of the country, or which could not be properly attended by the distant inhabitants.
