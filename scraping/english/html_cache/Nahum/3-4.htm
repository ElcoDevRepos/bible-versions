In biblical terms, "harlotry" often symbolizes idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The Assyrians were known for their worship of multiple deities and their oppressive practices. The use of "many harlotries" emphasizes the extent and repetition of their sins, suggesting a deep-seated pattern of behavior that has persisted over time. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, such as Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to adultery.<p><b>the seductive mistress of sorcery</b><br>Nineveh is personified as a "seductive mistress," indicating its allure and deceptive nature. The term "sorcery" suggests the use of occult practices, which were common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. These practices were often associated with attempts to manipulate spiritual forces for personal gain. The seductive nature of Nineveh's influence can be seen in its ability to captivate and control other nations, drawing them into its web of idolatry and immorality. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the dangers of being enticed away from faithfulness to God.<p><b>who betrays nations by her prostitution</b><br>The betrayal of nations indicates the political and spiritual treachery of Nineveh. As a dominant empire, Assyria exerted influence over many nations, often through alliances that were ultimately self-serving and destructive. The term "prostitution" here symbolizes the selling of one's integrity and loyalty for gain, a common metaphor in the Bible for idolatry and unfaithfulness. This betrayal is not just political but also spiritual, as nations are led away from the worship of the true God.<p><b>and clans by her witchcraft</b><br>The mention of "clans" suggests a more intimate level of influence, reaching into the smaller, familial units within society. "Witchcraft" implies the use of forbidden spiritual practices to exert control and manipulate others. This highlights the pervasive nature of Nineveh's corruption, affecting not just large political entities but also the foundational social structures. The Bible consistently condemns witchcraft as an abomination, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, underscoring the seriousness of Nineveh's offenses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its wealth, power, and idolatry.

Perversion of religious instinct is frequently denounced under the same figure in Scripture. Here, however, a more literal interpretation is possible, since there is reason to believe the religious rites of Assyria were characterised, like those of Babylon, by gross sensuality. According to Herod, i. 199, the Babylonian worship of Beltis or Mylitta was connected with a system of female prostitution, which was deemed "most shameful" even by the heathen historian. Compare also the Apocryphal Book of Bar 6:43. The same deity was worshipped in Assyria. Professor Rawlinson writes: "It would seem to follow almost as a matter of course that the worship of the same identical goddess in the adjoining country included a similar usage. It may be to this practice that the prophet Nahum alludes when he denounces Nineveh as a 'well-favoured harlot,' the multitude of whose harlotries was notorious" (<span class= "ital">Five Great Monarchies,</span> ii. 41).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The cause is given that has brought this punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the multitude of the whoredoms.</span> This term is commonly applied to idolatry, the swerving from the true God and turning to false deities; and it is thought that it cannot be used in that sense here, as Assyria had always worshipped idols, and could not be said to have forsaken or proved false to the Lord. Hence Hitzig, Keil, and others refer the term to the treacherous friendship and crafty politics by which Nineveh ensnared other states, seeking really only her own interests (comp. <a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>). But this habit of treachery has been already mentioned in ver. 1 (where see note); and, as Knabenbauer remarks, the Assyrians used no meretricious blandishments to effect their conquests, but the cruel arts of war and the stern ordeal of the sword. It is scarcely probable that the prophet would omit idolatry among the crimes of the Assyrians that called for vengeance, as all their wars were carried on in the name of their gods, and the monarchs professed to be under Divine protection and influence. The term "whoredom" is applied to the idolatry, not only of the Israelites, but to that of Jezebel (<a href="/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>), who was always a heathen. The idolatry of the Assyrians may very well be so called, because it was a wilful ignoring of the light of nature and natural religion (see Wisd. 13:1; <a href="/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>, etc.). They were careful, too, wherever they carried their arms, to erect there symbols of their deities, and to compel conquered nations to receive them and pay them Divine honour. With this idolatrous worship was associated that gross immorality which even Herodotus (1:199) termed utterly disgraceful (comp. Baruch 6:43). Rightly is Nineveh called <span class="cmt_word">the well favoured harlot</span>; for her splendour and magnificence were unsurpassed, dazzling all beholders and hiding the rottenness that lay below the surface. <span class="cmt_word">The mistress of witchcrafts.</span> She was skilful in employing every art to seduce nations to her side. We hear much of magic in connection with Babylon and the Chaldeans, but not in reference especially to Assyria. The expression here is metaphorical, alluding to the secret practices which she employed to gain her ends and to make her rule attractive (comp. <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That selleth nations.</span> Depriving them of freedom and making them tributary, or, in some cases, actually selling the inhabitants as slaves (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>; <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; <a href="/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>; <a href="/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6, 7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Families</span>.
