Mountains, often seen as symbols of strength and permanence, are depicted as trembling before the Lord. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>, where mountains melt like wax before the Lord. It underscores the idea that nothing in creation is beyond God's control or influence. The quaking of mountains can also be seen as a metaphor for the upheaval of nations and powers in the presence of divine judgment.<p><b>and the hills melt away</b><br>The melting of hills further illustrates the overwhelming presence of God. In ancient Near Eastern culture, hills and high places were often associated with the worship of deities. The imagery of hills melting signifies the futility of idolatry and the supremacy of the one true God. This can be connected to <a href="/isaiah/64.htm">Isaiah 64:1-3</a>, where the mountains quake at God's presence, highlighting His ability to dismantle human constructs and false gods.<p><b>the earth trembles at His presence</b><br>The trembling of the earth signifies a universal recognition of God's majesty and power. This is reminiscent of the theophany at Mount Sinai in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where the whole mountain trembled violently as God descended upon it. Such imagery serves to remind believers of God's holiness and the reverence due to Him. It also foreshadows the eschatological shaking of the earth described in <a href="/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>, where God will once more shake not only the earth but also the heavens.<p><b>the world and all its dwellers</b><br>This phrase extends the scope of God's dominion to include all inhabitants of the earth. It emphasizes that every person and creature is subject to God's authority. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>, which declares that the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. It serves as a reminder of human accountability to God and the inevitability of His judgment. The comprehensive nature of this statement also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's kingdom, where every knee will bow and every tongue confess His lordship, as prophesied in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet whose name means "comfort" or "consolation."

Scripture repeatedly shows mountains as symbols of permanence, yet they crumble when the Lord appears (<a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>, &#8220;The mountains melt like wax in the presence of the LORD&#8221;). That literal truth underscores:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty is not theoretical; it is felt in the physical world.<p>&#8226; Nothing created&#8212;no nation, no problem, no enemy&#8212;stands immovably against Him, echoing <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> when Mount Sinai shook at His descent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the hills melt away</b><p>Hills are smaller than mountains, but Nahum&#8217;s pairing widens the scope: from towering peaks down to rolling rises, all terrain yields to God. This melting recalls <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>, &#8220;The mountains will melt beneath Him, and the valleys will split apart.&#8221; The imagery serves two purposes:<p>&#8226; To reveal God&#8217;s consuming holiness that dissolves whatever is tainted by sin (<a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; To comfort His people&#8212;if hills melt, so do obstacles to their deliverance (<a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the earth trembles at His presence</b><p>Nahum shifts from specific features to the entire planet. The trembling is literal, like the earthquakes that accompanied divine appearances&#8212;see <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a> when the earth shook at Jesus&#8217; death. It also signals moral accountability: the Judge has arrived (<a href="/psalms/114-7.htm">Psalm 114:7</a>). Key take-aways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s presence is not passive; it produces measurable change.<p>&#8226; Trembling reminds us to approach Him with reverence (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the world and all its dwellers</b><p>Finally, Nahum makes it personal. Every person living anywhere is included. This truth parallels <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>, where kings and slaves alike seek refuge from God&#8217;s face. Practical implications:<p>&#8226; No one is exempt from answering to the Lord (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, His universal rule assures ultimate justice and protection (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> proclaims that when God moves, the steadfast quakes, the small dissolves, the planet shudders, and every human is confronted. His presence is overwhelming yet reassuring: overwhelming to the rebellious, reassuring to the redeemed. Trusting this literal reality fuels awe, repentance, and confident hope in His unshakeable reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nahum/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Is burned.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">heaves.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mountains quake.</span> The mountains, the very emblems of stability, tremble before him (Adios 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">The hills melt;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "The hills were shaken" (Septuagint).
