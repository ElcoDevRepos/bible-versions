In ancient times, throwing filth or dung was a way to show extreme disdain and disgrace. This imagery reflects the complete moral and spiritual corruption of Nineveh, which had been a powerful and oppressive city. The use of filth symbolizes the defilement and degradation that comes as a consequence of sin. This judgment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God uses vivid imagery to convey His wrath, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>, where filth represents impurity and sin.<p><b>and treat you with contempt</b><br>The contempt shown here is a direct response to Nineveh's arrogance and cruelty. Assyria was known for its brutal conquests and harsh treatment of other nations, including Israel and Judah. This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes, where the once-mighty city is now the object of scorn. The contempt is not just from God but will be witnessed by other nations, as Nineveh's downfall becomes a public spectacle. This aligns with the biblical principle that pride precedes destruction, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<p><b>I will make a spectacle of you</b><br>Making Nineveh a spectacle means that its destruction will serve as a warning and lesson to other nations. The fall of Nineveh was historically significant, as it marked the end of Assyrian dominance. This event is corroborated by historical records and archaeological findings that show the city's sudden and complete destruction around 612 BC. The spectacle of Nineveh's fall is a testament to God's sovereignty and justice, fulfilling the prophetic words spoken by Nahum. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment of all nations and the establishment of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon's fall is similarly depicted as a spectacle for the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Nahum is the author of the book that bears his name.
