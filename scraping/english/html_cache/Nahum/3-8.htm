It was the capital of the Egyptian empire during its height and was renowned for its wealth, power, and grandeur. The rhetorical question posed here challenges Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, to consider its own vulnerability despite its perceived strength. Thebes had been a formidable city, yet it fell to Assyrian forces in 663 BC under Ashurbanipal. This serves as a warning to Nineveh that no city, regardless of its might, is invincible against divine judgment.<p><b>stationed by the Nile</b><br>Thebes was strategically located along the Nile River, which was central to its prosperity and defense. The Nile provided not only a source of sustenance and trade but also a natural barrier against invaders. This geographical advantage is highlighted to emphasize the strength and security Thebes once enjoyed, making its eventual downfall even more significant as a lesson for Nineveh.<p><b>with water around her</b><br>Thebes was surrounded by canals and tributaries of the Nile, which added layers of protection and contributed to its flourishing agriculture and trade. The imagery of water surrounding the city underscores its natural defenses and the seeming impregnability that ultimately proved insufficient against divine judgment. This serves as a metaphor for the false security that nations and individuals might place in their own resources and defenses.<p><b>whose rampart was the sea</b><br>The term "sea" here likely refers to the vast expanse of the Nile and its associated waterways, which acted as a defensive barrier for Thebes. In ancient times, large bodies of water were often seen as formidable obstacles to invading armies. The mention of the sea as a rampart highlights the natural fortifications that Thebes relied upon, drawing a parallel to Nineveh's reliance on its own defenses.<p><b>whose wall was the water</b><br>Thebes' reliance on water as a defensive wall is a powerful image of security and strength. However, the fall of Thebes serves as a reminder that even the most fortified cities can be overcome. This phrase underscores the futility of relying solely on physical defenses without acknowledging the sovereignty of God. It also serves as a prophetic warning to Nineveh, illustrating that divine judgment can penetrate even the most secure fortifications.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/thebes.htm">Thebes (No-Amon)</a></b><br>An ancient city in Egypt, known for its wealth, power, and strong defenses.

Assyria herself had reduced the power of Thebes. (1) Sargon, the father of Sennacherib, had defeated Shebah, the Egyptian Tar-dan, at Rapikh, cir. B.C. 716. (2) Esar-haddon, Sennacherib's son, had routed the forces of Tirhakah, subjugated the whole of the Nile valley, and taken the city where Tirhakah held his court, probably Thebes, cir. B.C. 670. (3) Asshur-bani-pal invaded Egypt in the year of his accession, B.C. 668, and reinstated certain rulers of his father's appointment, whom Tirhakah had driven out. In B.C. 665, another revolt brought this king again into Egypt. On this occasion Thebes was certainly sacked, and a large booty, including "gold, silver, precious stones, dyed garments, captives (male and female), tame animals brought up in the palace, obelisks, &c., was carried off, and conveyed to Nineveh" <span class= "ital">{Five Great Monarchies,</span> ii. 203). The present passage may refer either to this event or to Esar-haddon's previous capture of Thebes. The fall of the city was certainly a thing of the past when Nahum wrote. The allusion, therefore, helps us to assign the date of the composition (see Introduction). To mere human reasoning the downfall of Thebes testified to the power of Assyria, its conqueror. But to the inspired vision of Nahum, the ruin of the one world-power is an earnest of the ruin of the other. Both had been full of luxury and oppression, both were hated of mankind and opposed to God. If No-Amon has fallen, the city of the hundred gates, the metropolis of the Pharaohs, the conqueror whose countless captives reared the pyramids, why shall Nineveh stand? If Nineveh is protected by rivers--the Tigris and the Khausser--had not Thebes a rampart in the Nile, that "sea" of waters (comp. <a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm" title="And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.">Isaiah 19:5</a>), and its numerous canals? If Nineveh relies on subordinate or friendly states--Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Syria--had not Thebes all the resources of Africa--Ethiopia in the south, the Egypts in the north, her Libyan allies, Put and the Lubim, in the north-west? Yet what was the fate of No Amon? Her youth carried off in the slave-gangs of Assyria; her infants dashed to pieces at the street-corner (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm" title="And Hazael said, Why weeps my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that you will do to the children of Israel: their strong holds will you set on fire, and their young men will you slay with the sword, and will dash their children, and rip up their women with child.">2Kings 8:12</a>), as unprofitable to the captor; her senators reserved to grace a triumph, and assigned to the Assyrian generals by lot (<a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - &sect; 2<span class="accented">.

"Populous No" ought to be rendered, <span class="accented">No-Amon, i.e.</span> No of the solar god Amon. This is the celebrated Thebes, in Upper Egypt, called in Egyptian Pa-Amun, "the House of Amun," and in the inscriptions Ni, which is the same word as No. The name Amon is attached because that god was particularly worshipped there. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> ("a portion of or for Ammon"), translating the word "No." St. Jerome, misled by his Hebrew teacher, renders, "Alexandria populorum," as if Thebes stood on the site of the much later city of Alexandria; whereas we see from Assurbanipal's annals that he was forty days marching from Memphis, where he defeated Rudammon, to Thebes (see G. Smith, 'Assurbanipal,' p. 55). On the grandeur and magnificence of this city, Denon (quoted by Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:309, note 7), writes, "On est fatigue d'ecrire, on est fatigue de lire, on est epouvante de la pensee d'une telle conception; on ne peut croire, meme apres l'avoir vu, a la realite de l'existence de tant de constructions reunies sur un meme point, a leurs dimensions, a la constance obstinee qu'a exigee leur fabrication, aux depenses incalculables de taut de somptuosite" ('Egypte,' 2:226). "In the long and rich valley of the Lower Nile, which extends above five hundred miles from Syene to Memphis, almost any situation might furnish a site for a great city, since, except at Silsilis and at the Gebelein, the valley is never less than two miles wide, the soil is always fertile, good quarries are always at hand, and lavish Nature is so bounteous with her gifts that abundant sustenance can at any point be obtained for a large population. But in this wealth of eligible sites, there are still degrees of eligibility - spots which Nature has distinguished by special favour, and, as it were, marked out for greatness and celebrity. Such a position is that which the traveller reaches when, passing through the gorge of the Gebelein, he emerges upon the magnificent plain, at least ten miles in width, through which the river flows with a course from southwest to northeast for a distance of some forty miles between Erment and Qobt. Here, for the first time since quitting the Nubian desert, does the Nile enter upon a wide and ample space. On either side the hills recede, and a broad green plain, an alluvium of the richest description, spreads itself out on both banks of the stream, dotted with <span class="accented">dom</span> and date palms, sometimes growing singly, sometimes collected into clumps or groves. Here, too, there open out on either side, to the east and to the west, lines of route offering great advantages for trade, on the one hand with the Lesser Oasis and so with the tribes of the African interior, on the other with the western coast of the Red Sea and the spice region of the opposite shore. In the valley of Hammamat, down which passed the ancient route to the coast, are abundant supplies of <span class="accented">breccia verde</span> and of other valuable and rare kinds of stone, while at no great distance to the right and left of the route lie mines of gold, silver, and lead, anciently prolific, though exhausted now for many ages. Somewhat more remote, yet readily accessible by a frequented route, was the emerald region of Gebel Zabara, where the mines are still worked" (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Egypt,' 2:124, etc.). Thebes was situated on both banks of the Nile, the principal portion lying on the east; the Necropolis and Memnonia were on the west. It seems never to have been surrounded with a wall (notwithstanding its "hundred gates"), the river and canals forming a sufficient defence. At the present time the ruins are some twenty-seven miles in circuit, including Luxor and the remains of the great temple at Karnak. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Nile formed its rampart.
