Thebes was a significant cultural and religious center, known for its wealth and grandeur. The prophecy highlights the inevitability of divine judgment, as even a city as mighty as Thebes could not escape destruction. This serves as a warning to Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, that it too would face a similar fate. The concept of exile and captivity is a recurring theme in the Bible, often symbolizing God's judgment and the consequences of sin (e.g., the Babylonian exile of Judah).<p><b>Her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street.</b><br>This brutal imagery underscores the totality of Thebes' destruction and the merciless nature of ancient warfare. The killing of infants was a common practice in ancient conquests, intended to eliminate future threats and demoralize the population. This phrase also serves as a stark reminder of the severity of God's judgment against sin and rebellion. The destruction of innocents is a theme that appears elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the massacre of the innocents in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16-18</a>), which foreshadows the suffering of Christ and the ultimate victory over evil.<p><b>They cast lots for her dignitaries,</b><br>Casting lots was a method used in ancient times to make decisions or divide spoils, often seen as leaving the outcome to divine will. In this context, it signifies the complete humiliation and dehumanization of Thebes' leaders, reduced to mere commodities to be divided among the conquerors. This act of casting lots is reminiscent of the soldiers casting lots for Jesus' garments at the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23-24</a>), highlighting the fulfillment of prophecy and the suffering of the righteous.<p><b>and all her nobles were bound in chains.</b><br>The binding of nobles in chains symbolizes the total subjugation and defeat of Thebes. It reflects the reversal of fortunes for those who once held power and authority, now reduced to captives. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of the proud being humbled and the mighty being brought low (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>).

In spite of her strong position and infinite resources, Thebes was captured and despoiled; and shall Nineveh fare better? Surely not. This capture of Thebes took place <span class="date">B.C. 664</span>, and must have been in men's minds when Nahum wrote his prophecy. The Assyrians twice took Thebes in the days of Assurbanipal. The first time it is merely recorded that the soldiers, under the commander of the satraps, made a slaughter in the city. The second capture is thus described in the monarch's own tablet (Brugsch, 'Egypt,' 1:272-275, Eng. transl.): "Urdamaneh fled alone, and entered Thebes, the city of his kingdom... I directed my march in pursuit of him. I came to Thebes. He saw the strength of my army, and left Thebes, and fled to the city of Kipkip. Of that whole city (Thebes), with thanksgiving to Asur and Istar, my hands took the complete possession. Silver, gold, metals, stones, all the treasures of its palace whatsoever, dyed garments of before and linen, great horses [elephants?] men and women, great and small, works of zakah [basalt?] and marble, their kelal and manzas, the gates of their palace... I tare away and carried to Assyria. I made spoil of the animals of the land without number, and carried them forth in the midst out of Thebes I caused a catalogue to be made of the spoil. I returned in safety to Nineveh" (see a different version in O.
