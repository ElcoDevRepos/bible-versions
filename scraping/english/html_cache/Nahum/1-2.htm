The term "jealous" in this context refers to God's zeal for His people and His covenant, similar to a husband's protective love for his wife. This is not envy but a righteous desire to maintain the sanctity of His relationship with Israel. The concept of God as an avenger is rooted in His role as a just judge who defends His people and upholds His moral order. This is seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares vengeance belongs to Him. Historically, this reflects the period when Assyria oppressed Israel, and God&#8217;s promise to avenge His people was a source of hope.<p><b>the LORD is avenging and full of wrath.</b><br>The repetition of "avenging" emphasizes the certainty and intensity of God's justice. His wrath is not capricious but a measured response to sin and injustice. This wrath is directed against those who oppose His will and harm His people. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, gods were often seen as capricious, but the God of Israel is portrayed as consistent and righteous in His anger. This aligns with <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>, where God's wrath is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness.<p><b>The LORD takes vengeance on His foes</b><br>This phrase underscores God's active role in confronting and defeating His enemies. The term "foes" refers to those who oppose God's purposes and oppress His people. This is a reassurance to the faithful that God is not indifferent to their suffering. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who will ultimately defeat all His enemies, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>, where Christ returns as a conquering King.<p><b>and reserves wrath for His enemies.</b><br>Here, the idea of "reserves" suggests that God's judgment is deliberate and stored up for the appropriate time. This indicates patience and a desire for repentance, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish. However, for those who persist in rebellion, His wrath is inevitable. This reflects the historical context of Nahum, where Assyria's continued oppression led to their eventual downfall, fulfilling God's promise of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet whose name means "comfort" or "consolation."

Just as <a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a> says, &#8220;For you shall not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.&#8221;<p>- His jealousy safeguards His covenant people from idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>).<p>- &#8220;Avenging&#8221; assures us that He does not overlook sin. <a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1</a> calls Him the &#8220;God of vengeance,&#8221; affirming that justice belongs to Him alone.<p>- Key takeaway: God&#8217;s jealousy and vengeance are inseparable from His holiness and love. He defends His glory and His people with perfect zeal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD is avenging and full of wrath</b><p>- The verse repeats &#8220;avenging&#8221; for emphasis, underscoring certainty. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a> echoes, &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay.&#8221;<p>- &#8220;Full of wrath&#8221; means God&#8217;s anger is neither capricious nor partial; it is complete, proportionate, and perfectly timed (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p>- Wrath flows from His holy nature. <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a> notes, &#8220;Your eyes are too pure to look on evil.&#8221;<p>- For believers, Christ absorbs that wrath (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>), but for the unrepentant it remains a sober reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD takes vengeance on His foes and reserves wrath for His enemies</b><p>- &#8220;Foes&#8221; and &#8220;enemies&#8221; point to those who persist in rebellion. <a href="/psalms/68-21.htm">Psalm 68:21</a> affirms, &#8220;Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies.&#8221;<p>- Vengeance is active (&#8220;takes&#8221;) while wrath is held in store (&#8220;reserves&#8221;), assuring eventual justice even when judgment seems delayed (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>- Nineveh, the audience of Nahum, had once repented under Jonah but returned to violence (<a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>). God&#8217;s patience ran its course, proving His vengeance is purposeful, not impulsive.<p>- For the redeemed, this truth offers comfort: wickedness will not prevail indefinitely (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2</a> reveals a God who fiercely guards His glory, faithfully defends His people, and perfectly judges evil. His jealousy protects, His vengeance rectifies wrongs, and His stored wrath guarantees that no sin escapes His notice. Such attributes call us to trust His justice, rest in Christ&#8217;s redemption, and live in reverent obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/nahum/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2-8) God's character a pledge that the oppressor of His servants shall be destroyed.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">God</span> . . . <span class= "bld">furious.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">A jealous and vengeful God is Jehovah, an avenger is Jehovah, aye, wrathful.</span> This verse lays the groundwork for the declaration of God's sentence against the offending city.
