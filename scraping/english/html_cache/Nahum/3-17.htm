The comparison of guards to swarming locusts suggests a vast, uncontrollable force. However, this imagery also implies that the guards, despite their numbers, are ultimately ineffective and transient. Historically, Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, was known for its formidable military might, yet Nahum prophesies their downfall, indicating that their defenses will be as fleeting as a swarm of locusts. This reflects the biblical theme that human strength is futile without divine support, as seen in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>.<p><b>and your scribes like clouds of locusts</b><br>Scribes in ancient Assyria were crucial for administration and maintaining records, akin to the bureaucratic backbone of the empire. Comparing them to clouds of locusts suggests they are numerous and pervasive, yet also hints at their impermanence and lack of true power. This imagery underscores the futility of relying on human wisdom and planning, echoing the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>, where God promises to confound the wisdom of the wise.<p><b>that settle on the walls on a cold day</b><br>Locusts are known to settle and become inactive in cooler temperatures, which can symbolize a temporary state of security or inactivity. The walls of a city were its primary defense, and the image of locusts settling on them suggests a false sense of security. This reflects the temporary peace and stability that Assyria might have felt, unaware of the impending judgment. The cold day can symbolize a time of apparent calm before the storm, reminiscent of <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where sudden destruction comes upon those who feel secure.<p><b>When the sun rises, they fly away</b><br>The rising sun represents the coming of judgment and the revealing of truth. Just as locusts scatter when warmed by the sun, the guards and scribes will disperse when faced with the reality of God's judgment. This imagery highlights the transient nature of human power and the inevitability of divine intervention. The sun rising can also be seen as a metaphor for Christ, the "Sun of Righteousness" (<a href="/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>), whose coming exposes and dispels darkness.<p><b>and no one knows where</b><br>The disappearance of the locusts without a trace emphasizes the complete and sudden nature of Assyria's downfall. This phrase underscores the unpredictability and inevitability of divine judgment. It serves as a warning that those who rely on their own strength and wisdom will find themselves lost and without refuge when God acts. This theme is echoed in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which speaks of the fleeting nature of life and human plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards_and_officials.htm">Guards and Officials</a></b><br>These represent the leaders and protectors of Nineveh, who are compared to locusts in their fleeting presence and unreliability.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts.htm">Locusts</a></b><br>In the ancient Near East, locusts were a symbol of destruction and transience, often used to describe overwhelming and uncontrollable forces.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its power and eventual downfall due to its wickedness and opposition to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sun.htm">The Sun</a></b><br>Symbolizes exposure and judgment, revealing the true nature of the guards and officials.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/walls.htm">Walls</a></b><br>Represent the supposed strength and security of Nineveh, which ultimately proves to be inadequate.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fleeting_nature_of_earthly_power.htm">The Fleeting Nature of Earthly Power</a></b><br>Earthly leaders and systems, like locusts, can be unreliable and temporary.

The sudden disappearance of the Assyrian locust-pest is here enlarged upon. A sudden outburst of sunshine will sometimes induce a swarm of locusts to take flight; cold, on the other hand, makes these insects settle, and soon deprives them of the power of flying. Dr. Pusey well observes, "The heathen conqueror rehearsed his victory, 'I came, I saw, conquered.' The prophet goes further, as the issue of all human conquest, 'I disappeared.'" The insect designations, rendered in Authorised Version, "cankerworm," "locust," "great grasshopper," all represent varieties of the locust species.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy crowned.</span> The word <span class="accented">minnezar</span> is found only here, and, as its derivation is uncertain, it has received various interpretations. The Anglican Version derives the word from <span class="accented">nezer</span>, "a diadem," and "the crowned" are the officials of upper rank. "High officers of state in Assyria were adorned with diadems, closely resembling the lower baud of the royal mitre, separated from the cap itself. Very commonly the head was encircled with a simple fillet or hoop, probably of gold, without any adornment" (Gosse, 'Assyria,' p. 463, quoted by Strauss; see the figures in Bonomi, p. 319). Others derive it from <span class="accented">nazar.</span> "to separate," in the signification of "those separated or selected for war." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the band of mixed mercenary troops - a rendering in which Wordsworth acquiesces. Knabenbauer (referring to Strassmaier's Assyrian vocabulary) considers the word to be a transliteration (<span class="accented">ss</span> being resolved into <span class="accented">ne</span>) of the Assyrian <span class="accented">ma-as-sa-ru</span>, which means "guardian," or some inferior officer. With this agrees the Vulgate <span class="accented">custodes. <span class="cmt_word"></span>As the locusts;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in multitude. That the number of captains and superior officers would be very great may be conjectured from the inscriptions which sometimes enumerate the captives carried off from conquered countries. Thus in the account of the capture of some insignificant nation, the then king boasts that he took away 13,000 fighting men, 1121 captains, and 460 superior officers (Strauss, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The prophet's meaning is that if the officers, etc., are so numerous, the multitude of soldiers and civilians must be truly immense. <span class="cmt_word">Thy captains.</span> <span class="accented">Taphsar</span> is an Assyrian word, occurring only in <a href="/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>. It is probably the same as <span class="accented">dupsarru</span> or <span class="accented">dipsarru</span> of the inscriptions, and is taken to signify "a scribe" (see Sehrader, p. 424) Such officials are often represented on the monuments (see Layard, 2:184), and seem sometimes to have been of high or priestly rank. Jerome translates, <span class="accented">parvuli</span> <span class="accented">tui</span>, though in Jeremiah, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, he retains the Assyrian word. The Septuagint omits it. <span class="cmt_word">Great grasshoppers;</span> <span class="accented">swarms of locusts</span> (<a href="/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which camp in the hedges in the cold day</span>.
