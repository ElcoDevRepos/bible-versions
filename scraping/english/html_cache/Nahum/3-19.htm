Historically, Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its military might and cruelty. The "injury" refers to the irreversible judgment pronounced by God. In biblical context, this echoes the theme of divine retribution found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/jeremiah/30-12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12-15</a>, where God declares incurable wounds as a metaphor for judgment.<p><b>your wound is severe.</b><br>The severity of Nineveh's wound underscores the totality of its downfall. Archaeological evidence shows that Nineveh was utterly destroyed in 612 BC by a coalition of Babylonians, Medes, and Scythians. This aligns with the prophetic declaration of Nahum, emphasizing that the city's destruction was not just a temporary setback but a complete obliteration. The severity also reflects the extent of Nineveh's sins and the corresponding divine justice.<p><b>All who hear the news of you applaud your downfall,</b><br>This phrase highlights the widespread relief and satisfaction among other nations at Nineveh's demise. Historically, Assyria was notorious for its oppressive rule over conquered peoples. The "applause" signifies the end of tyranny and the liberation of those who suffered under Assyrian dominance. This sentiment is mirrored in <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-8</a>, where the fall of Babylon is similarly celebrated by the nations.<p><b>for who has not experienced your constant cruelty?</b><br>The rhetorical question emphasizes the universal experience of Assyria's brutality. Assyrian records and reliefs depict their harsh treatment of captives and conquered peoples, confirming their reputation for cruelty. This phrase serves as a reminder of the moral and ethical standards God holds nations to, and it connects to the broader biblical theme of justice, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>, where justice brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its great power and cruelty.

The "wound" is the stroke or plague inflicted by God (<a href="/leviticus/26-21.htm">Leviticus 26:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall clap the hands over thee.</span> All who hear of thy destruction will rejoice over it (<a href="/psalms/47-1.htm">Psalm 47:1</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy wickedness.</span> The cruelty and oppression of Nineveh have been universally felt. If Edom is the type of insidious foes of the Church's own household, Nineveh is the emblem of open, blaspheming infidelity, arrayed in powerful opposition against God's people. In the overthrow of this kingdom there is a prophecy of the destruction of all anti-Christian powers, which shall be utterly crushed in the latter days. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/nahum/3-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There is no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">healing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#234;&#183;h&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3545.htm">Strong's 3545: </a> </span><span class="str2">A weakening, alleviation, cure</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for your injury;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1462;&#1428;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;i&#7687;&#183;re&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
