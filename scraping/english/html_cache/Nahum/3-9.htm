In biblical times, Cush was known for its powerful warriors and was a significant kingdom. Egypt, a dominant power in the ancient Near East, was renowned for its wealth, military might, and cultural influence. Together, Cush and Egypt represented formidable strength and resources. Historically, these nations were often allies, and their combined power was seen as nearly invincible. This phrase highlights the extent of their influence and the perceived security that came from their alliance. The reference to their "boundless strength" underscores the futility of relying on human power and alliances instead of God, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>Put and Libya were her allies.</b><br>Put is generally associated with the region west of Egypt, possibly modern-day Libya or parts of North Africa. Libya, mentioned alongside Put, further emphasizes the geographical spread and the political alliances of the time. These regions were known for their skilled warriors and were often mercenaries in ancient armies. The mention of these allies indicates a coalition of nations that supported each other militarily and politically. This alliance reflects the common practice of forming coalitions for mutual defense and expansion in the ancient world. The prophetic message here serves as a reminder of the limitations of such alliances when they stand in opposition to God's will. The reliance on these allies, despite their strength, ultimately could not prevent the downfall that God had decreed, illustrating the sovereignty of God over nations and their destinies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cush.htm">Cush</a></b><br>Often identified with the region south of Egypt, possibly modern-day Sudan or Ethiopia.

Egypt. The Egyptians proper, combined with the Ethiopians, formed the kingdom of Egypt under the twenty-fifth, the Ethiopian, dynasty. And it was infinite. The power of Egypt was boundless, its forces in numerable (see <a href="/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>). Pusey notes a remark of Cato (in Steph. Byzant. ap. Boch., 4:27) that the Egyptians connected with Thebes amounted to seven millions. In <a href="/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18-20</a>.

Put, or Punt, designates either a part of Arabia or that part of the coast of Egypt opposite to it (see Ebers, 'AEgypt. und die Buch. Mos.,' p. 64, etc.). Luhim are the Lybians, dwelling on the west of the Canopic mouth of the Nile. Thus the enumeration of the forces of Thebes is regularly arranged, beginning with the south, Ethiopia, then through Egypt proper to the north, and then to the provinces on the east and west (Knabenbauer).
