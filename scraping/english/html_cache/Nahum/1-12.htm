It is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but a direct communication from God. This establishes the seriousness and reliability of the prophecy.<p><b>Though they are allied and numerous,</b><br>This refers to the Assyrian Empire, known for its vast alliances and military strength. Historically, Assyria was a dominant power in the ancient Near East, often forming coalitions with other nations to expand its influence. The phrase highlights the apparent invincibility of Assyria due to its numerous allies and resources, yet it foreshadows their impending downfall.<p><b>yet they will be cut down and pass away.</b><br>Despite their strength and alliances, the Assyrians are destined for destruction. This prophecy was fulfilled when Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, fell in 612 BC. The imagery of being "cut down" suggests a sudden and decisive end, akin to a tree being felled. This demonstrates God's sovereignty over nations, regardless of their power.<p><b>Though I have afflicted you, O Judah,</b><br>Here, God acknowledges the suffering and discipline He has allowed Judah to experience, often at the hands of Assyria. This affliction was part of God's corrective measures due to Judah's disobedience and idolatry. It reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of judgment against His people.<p><b>I will afflict you no longer.</b><br>This promise of relief signifies a turning point for Judah. It indicates the end of divine discipline and the beginning of restoration. Theologically, it underscores God's mercy and faithfulness to His covenant people. This assurance would have been a source of hope and encouragement for the people of Judah, pointing to a future where they would no longer be under the oppression of foreign powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Nahum is the author of the book that bears his name.
