"Jacob" often represents the entire nation of Israel, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people. The restoration of "splendor" suggests a return to former glory and prosperity, reminiscent of the times under King David and Solomon when Israel was at its peak. This promise of restoration is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God assures His people of eventual redemption despite their current suffering or exile (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>).<p><b>like the splendor of Israel</b><br>The mention of "Israel" alongside "Jacob" reinforces the idea of a united and restored nation. Historically, the division of the kingdom into Israel (the northern kingdom) and Judah (the southern kingdom) led to a period of decline and vulnerability. The reference to "splendor" here can also be seen as a prophetic vision of a future where the nation is not only restored physically but also spiritually, aligning with God's original purpose for them as a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>).<p><b>though destroyers have laid them waste</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the current or past devastation experienced by the people of Israel. Historically, this could refer to the Assyrian conquest of the northern kingdom in 722 BC or the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The "destroyers" are often seen as instruments of God's judgment due to Israel's disobedience and idolatry. However, the acknowledgment of destruction also sets the stage for the promise of restoration, highlighting God's sovereignty and mercy.<p><b>and ruined the branches of their vine</b><br>The imagery of a vine is frequently used in the Bible to symbolize Israel (e.g., <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The "branches" being ruined suggests a loss of fruitfulness and vitality, often associated with the nation's spiritual decline and moral corruption. This metaphor also points to the hope of future restoration, as God promises to replant and nurture His people, leading to renewed growth and productivity. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>), indicating that ultimate restoration and fruitfulness come through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

But Jehovah has allowed its hedge to be broken down. "All they that go by do pluck her . . ." (<a href="/context/psalms/80-12.htm" title="Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?">Psalm 80:12-13</a>). In the punishment of one notoriously oppressive world-power the prophet sees a pledge that the branch of Jehovah shall be again "beautiful and glorious" (<a href="/isaiah/4-2.htm" title="In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.">Isaiah 4:2</a>). The construction in the first part of the verse is perplexing. It appears best to attach a special emphasis to the names "Jacob" and "Israel" in connection with their original signification. "Jacob" is the birth-name--the nation regarded apart from its religious privileges, the homeless exile, the downtrodden "worm (<a href="/isaiah/41-14.htm" title="Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 41:14</a>), the younger son among nations. But "Israel" is the chosen of God; he who "had power over the angel and prevailed"; the "beloved son, called out of Egypt." The name given by Jehovah is henceforth to have its full significance, as in the days of old. "Jacob," the name which is so often used after the deportation of the ten tribes, is again to be indicated as "Israel," the favoured people of God. Some commentators render, "For Jehovah restores alike the glory of Jacob and the glory of Israel," &c., making "Jacob" the designation of the southern, "Israel" that of the northern kingdom. But the term "Jacob" nowhere else has this distinctive force.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/nahum/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - This ruin shall fall on Nineveh because God is mindful of his chosen people, whom Assyria has oppressed. <span class="cmt_word">Hath turned away.</span> It should be rendered, <span class="accented">returneth to</span>, or <span class="accented">restoreth, bringeth back</span>; <span class="accented">reddidit</span> (Vulgate); <a href="/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel.</span> The Lord restores the glory and honour of Jacob, the nation in its political aspect, and the high privileges of the spiritual Israel, the chosen people of God (comp. <a href="/obadiah/1-18.htm">Obadiah 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.
