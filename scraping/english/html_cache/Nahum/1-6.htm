In the context of Nahum, God&#8217;s indignation is directed towards Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, known for its cruelty and idolatry. The rhetorical question implies that no one can resist or oppose God&#8217;s righteous anger. This echoes similar sentiments found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/76-7.htm">Psalm 76:7</a>, which speaks of God&#8217;s fearsome power. The historical context is significant, as Assyria was a dominant empire, yet even its might could not withstand God&#8217;s judgment.<p><b>Who can endure His burning anger?</b><br>The imagery of "burning anger" conveys the intensity and consuming nature of God&#8217;s wrath. This is not a capricious anger but a holy response to sin and injustice. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often depicted gods as having human-like emotions, but the God of Israel&#8217;s anger is always just and purposeful. This phrase connects to <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, where God is described as a consuming fire, highlighting His holiness and the seriousness of sin.<p><b>His wrath is poured out like fire;</b><br>Fire is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and purification. In the prophetic literature, fire often symbolizes God&#8217;s purifying judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>. The pouring out of wrath suggests a deliberate and complete action, indicating that God&#8217;s judgment is both thorough and inescapable. This imagery would resonate with the original audience, familiar with the destructive power of fire in their environment.<p><b>even rocks are shattered before Him.</b><br>This phrase underscores the absolute power of God&#8217;s judgment. Rocks, often symbols of strength and permanence, are depicted as being shattered, illustrating that nothing in creation can withstand God&#8217;s will. This connects to other biblical passages, such as <a href="/jeremiah/23-29.htm">Jeremiah 23:29</a>, where God&#8217;s word is likened to a hammer that breaks rock. The shattering of rocks also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and transformation of the world, as seen in eschatological passages like <a href="/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahum.htm">Nahum</a></b><br>A prophet who delivered God's message of judgment against Nineveh, the capital of Assyria, known for its wickedness and oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of the Assyrian Empire, notorious for its cruelty and idolatry, which faced God's impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_indignation.htm">God's Indignation</a></b><br>Represents God's righteous anger and judgment against sin and injustice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rocks.htm">The Rocks</a></b><br>Symbolic of the seemingly strong and unmovable entities that are shattered by God's power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_empire.htm">Assyrian Empire</a></b><br>A dominant power during Nahum's time, known for its military might and oppression of Israel and other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Reality of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's wrath is real and directed against sin and injustice.
