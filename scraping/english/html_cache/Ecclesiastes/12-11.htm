Similarly, the words of the wise are meant to provoke thought and action, guiding individuals toward righteousness and away from folly. This metaphor highlights the sometimes uncomfortable but necessary role of wisdom in prompting spiritual and moral growth. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> emphasizes the importance of wisdom and instruction, aligning with the idea that wisdom can direct one's path.<p><b>and the anthologies of the masters are like firmly embedded nails</b><br>The term "anthologies of the masters" refers to collected sayings or teachings of wise individuals. These teachings are compared to "firmly embedded nails," suggesting stability, permanence, and reliability. Just as nails hold structures together, the teachings of the wise provide a foundation for life. This imagery underscores the enduring nature of true wisdom, which remains relevant and applicable across generations. The stability offered by these teachings can be seen in the way Scripture is described as a firm foundation in passages like <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>.<p><b>driven by a single Shepherd</b><br>The "single Shepherd" is a reference to God, who is often depicted as a shepherd in the Bible, guiding and caring for His people. This imagery is prevalent in passages such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus refers to Himself as the Good Shepherd. The idea that the wisdom of the wise is ultimately driven by God emphasizes the divine origin and authority of true wisdom. It suggests that all genuine wisdom and understanding come from God, who orchestrates and directs the teachings that guide His people.

Though the general purpose of the verses is plain, the words used are enigmatical, and one cannot feel great confidence in assigning their precise meaning. The translation of our version fairly represents the original, if it is observed that the words "by" and "which," which determine the meaning, are in italics. With regard to the "nail," compare <a href="/ezra/9-8.htm" title="And now for a little space grace has been showed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.">Ezra 9:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-23.htm" title="And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father's house.">Isaiah 22:23</a>. The word "masters" we have had twice in this book already in the sense of possessor, "master of the tongue" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm" title="Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>), "master of wings" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>). "Assemblies" is a word not coming from the same root as that from which Koheleth is derived. It might mean collections of sayings as well as of people. It is difficult to affix any meaning to the last clause, except that the sages, of whom the verse speaks, have been given for the instruction of the people by Israel's great Shepherd (<a href="/psalms/80-1.htm" title="Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a flock; you that dwell between the cherubim, shine forth.">Psalm 80:1</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise are as goads</span>. The connection of this verse with the preceding is maintained by the fact that the "acceptable words," etc., are words of the wise, emanate from the same persons. Herewith he proceeds to characterize them, with especial reference to his own work. The goad was a rod with an iron spike, or sharpened at the end, used in driving oxen (see <a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a>; Ecclus. 38:25; <a href="/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>). Words of wisdom are called goads because they rouse to exertion, promote reflection and action, restrain from error, impel to right; if they hurt and sting, the pain which they inflict is healthful, for good and not for evil. <span class="cmt_word">And as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies</span>. The proposition "by" is an interpolation, and the sentence should run: Ant/ <span class="accented">like nails fastened</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">the, etc</span>. <span class="accented">- masmeroth</span>, "nails," as in <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>. There is much difficulty in explaining the next words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">baale asuppoth</span>). We have had similar expressions applied to possessors in <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>, "lord of the tongue," and "lord of wings" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>); and analogy might lead us to apply the phrase here to-persons, and not things; but in <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> we find a threshing-instrument termed "lord of teeth;" and in <a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a> a town is called Baal-Perazim, "Lord of breaches;" so we must be guided by other considerations in our exposition. The Septuagint, taking the whole sentence together, and regarding <span class="accented">baals</span> as a preposition, renders, "As nails firmly planted, (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) which from the collections were given from one shepherd." Schleus-her takes <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> to mean, "<span class="accented">Ii</span> quibus munus datum erat collectionem faciendi," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the author, of collections. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Verba</span>... <span class="accented">quae per magistrorum consilium data sunt a pastore uno</span>. The "masters of assemblies" can only be the chiefs of some learned conclaves, like the great synagogue supposed to exist in the time of Ezra and later. The clause would then assert that these pundits are like fastened nails, which seems rather unmeaning. One might say that their uttered sentiments became fixed in the mind as nails firmly driven in, but one could not properly say this of the men themselves. A late editor, Gietmann, suggests that "lords of collection" may mean "brave men, heroes, gathered in line of battle," serried ranks, just as in <a href="/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a> the <span class="accented">term shalishim</span>, chariot-fighters, chieftains, is applied to choice proverbs. Thus he would say that the words of the wise are as goads because they stimulate the intellect, as nails because they readily find entrance, and like men in battle array when they are reduced to writing and marshaled in a book. This is certainly ingenious, but somewhat too artificial to be regarded as the genuine intention of the writer. It seems best to take the word translated "assemblies" as denoting collections, not of people, but of proverbs; and the compound phrase would thus mean proverbs of an excellent character, the best of their sort gathered together in writing. Such words are well compared to nails; they are no longer floating loosely about, they are fixed in the memory, they secure other knowledge, and, though they are separate utterances, they have a certain unity and purpose. Nails are often used proverbially as emblems of what is fixed and unalterable. Thus AEschyl., 'Suppl.,' 944 - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <p><span class="accented">"Through them a nail is firmly fixed, that they<br />May rest immovable."</span> Cicero, 'Verr.,' 2:5.21, "Ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clave figeret;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to make it sure and steadfast (comp. Horace, 'Carm.,' 1:35. 17, et <span class="accented">seq</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Which are given from one shepherd</span>. All these words of the wise, collections, etc., proceed from one source, or are set forth by one authority. Who is] this shepherd? Some say that he is the <span class="accented">archisynagogus</span>, the president of the assemblies of wise men, to whose authority all these public utterances are subjected. But we do not <span class="accented">know</span> that such supervision existed or was exercised at the time when Koheleth wrote; and, as we saw above, there is probably no reference to any such assemblies in the passage. The "one shepherd" is doubtless Jehovah, who is called the Shepherd of Israel, who feeds his people like a flock, etc. (see <a href="/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>, etc.). The appellation is here used as concinnous with the thought of the ox-goad, intimating that God watches and leads his people like a tender shepherd and a skilful farmer. This is an important claim to inspiration. All these varied utterances, whatever form they take, whether his own or his predecessor's, are outcomes of wisdom, and proceed from him who is only wise, Almighty God. It is no disparagement of this work to imply that it is not the production of the true Solomon; Koheleth is ready to avow himself the writer, and yet claims a hearing as being equally moved by heavenly influence. It is like St. Paul's assertion (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>), "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1499;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are like goads,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1504;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(kad&#183;d&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k, Article &#124;
