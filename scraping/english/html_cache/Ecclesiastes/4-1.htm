The term "under the sun" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, symbolizing the earthly, temporal realm as opposed to the divine or eternal. The focus on "oppression" highlights the prevalence of injustice and suffering in the world. This reflects the fallen state of humanity post-Genesis 3, where sin introduced corruption and inequality. The historical context of ancient Israel, with its social hierarchies and external threats, provides a backdrop for understanding the prevalence of oppression. Theologically, this phrase underscores the need for divine justice and foreshadows the ultimate justice brought by Christ.<p><b>I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter;</b><br>The "tears of the oppressed" evoke a vivid image of suffering and helplessness. In biblical times, the oppressed often included widows, orphans, and foreigners, who were vulnerable to exploitation. The absence of a "comforter" emphasizes the lack of human intervention or support, pointing to a society failing in its moral duty. This can be contrasted with the New Testament promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>), offering divine solace and advocacy. The imagery of tears also connects to the Beatitudes, where Jesus blesses those who mourn, promising they will be comforted (<a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>).<p><b>the power lay in the hands of their oppressors,</b><br>This phrase highlights the imbalance of power, where oppressors wield control over the vulnerable. In the ancient Near East, power was often concentrated in the hands of kings, officials, and wealthy landowners, leading to systemic injustice. The biblical narrative frequently addresses the misuse of power, as seen in the prophets' denunciations of corrupt leaders (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). This imbalance is a reminder of the world's fallen state and the need for righteous leadership, ultimately fulfilled in the reign of Christ, who exercises perfect justice and mercy.<p><b>and there was no comforter.</b><br>The repetition of "no comforter" underscores the depth of despair and isolation experienced by the oppressed. In the Old Testament, God is often depicted as the defender of the downtrodden (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>), yet here, the absence of comfort suggests a world estranged from divine justice. This absence points to the need for a savior, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers rest to the weary and burdened (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Theologically, this phrase invites reflection on the role of the church as the body of Christ, called to be agents of comfort and justice in a broken world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, who is reflecting on the nature of life and human experience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>Individuals who suffer under the weight of injustice and exploitation, lacking any source of comfort or relief.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressors.htm">The Oppressors</a></b><br>Those who wield power and authority, often using it to exploit and dominate others.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tears_of_the_oppressed.htm">Tears of the Oppressed</a></b><br>Symbolic of the suffering and sorrow experienced by those who are victimized and marginalized.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_oppression.htm">The Reality of Oppression</a></b><br>Acknowledge that oppression is a persistent reality in a fallen world.

Earlier he wrote, &#8220;I have seen all the things that are done under the sun&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>), yet he looks again because the human condition keeps revealing new layers of vanity and sorrow. His repeated observation reminds us that evil in the world is not a one-time discovery; it confronts us each time we dare to notice (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I considered all the oppression taking place under the sun</b><p>The phrase &#8220;under the sun&#8221; limits the view to life on earth, apart from the final reckoning of God. From that horizontal vantage point Solomon sees systemic cruelty&#8212;&#8220;violence is ever before me&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). Oppression can be political, economic, domestic, or spiritual, but it always involves the strong exploiting the weak. God had warned Israel against this very sin (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22&#8211;24</a>), yet history shows how quickly societies forget.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw the tears of the oppressed</b><p>Oppression is not merely a statistic; it has a face streaked with tears. God likewise said, &#8220;I have surely seen the affliction of My people &#8230; I have heard their cry&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). Solomon&#8217;s empathy echoes Job&#8217;s lament for those &#8220;who groan in the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out&#8221; (<a href="/job/24-12.htm">Job 24:12</a>). A biblical worldview never shrugs at suffering; it stops and weeps with those who weep (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they had no comforter</b><p>Twice Solomon notes the absence of a comforter, underscoring utter loneliness. Earthly systems designed to help&#8212;courts, families, even religious institutions&#8212;often fail. Lamentations repeats the cry: &#8220;She has no one to comfort her&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/1-2.htm">Lamentations 1:2</a>). The gospel later reveals Christ as the One who will &#8220;give you another Advocate to be with you forever&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>), but Solomon is deliberately limiting his observation to what can be seen apart from that promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the power lay in the hands of their oppressors</b><p>Here is the crux: authority is being misused. &#8220;Woe to those who devise iniquity &#8230; because it is in the power of their hand&#8221; (<a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>). Proverbs pictures &#8220;a roaring lion and a charging bear&#8221; as wicked rulers over the poor (<a href="/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>). By highlighting where power resides, Solomon shows why the oppressed remain comfortless&#8212;those with resources choose exploitation over mercy. The verse whispers for justice that only God can fully deliver (<a href="/psalms/10-14.htm">Psalm 10:14&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there was no comforter</b><p>The repetition slams the door on quick fixes. Apart from divine intervention, worldly grief stays unresolved. Yet Scripture elsewhere unveils the future: &#8220;Comfort, comfort My people&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-1.htm">Isaiah 40:1</a>) and &#8220;He will wipe away every tear from their eyes&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>). Solomon&#8217;s bleak note drives us to long for that ultimate consolation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a> records Solomon&#8217;s sober snapshot of life &#8220;under the sun.&#8221; He sees relentless oppression, powerless victims, and the crushing absence of comfort, all because wrongful power dominates. The verse exposes human injustice and magnifies our need for the true Comforter and righteous Judge whom only God provides.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.</span><p>(1) Having dwelt on the instability of human happiness, the Preacher now turns to contemplate the actual misery of which the world is full.<p><span class= "bld">Oppressions.--</span><a href="/job/35-9.htm" title="By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.">Job 35:9</a>; <a href="/amos/3-9.htm" title="Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the middle thereof, and the oppressed in the middle thereof.">Amos 3:9</a>.<p><span class= "bld">No comforter.</span>--If Solomon were the writer, one asks, What was the king about?

A sad refrain, echoed again at the end of the verse with touching pathos. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); they had no earthly friends to visit them in their affliction, and they as yet knew not the soothing of the Holy Ghost, the Comforter (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). There was no one to wipe away their tears (<a href="/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>) or to redress their wrongs. The point is the powerlessness of man in the face of these disorders, his inability to right himself, the incompetence of others to aid him. <span class="cmt_word">On the side of their oppressors there was power</span> (koach), in a bad sense, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> equivalent to "violence." Thus the ungodly say, in the Book of Wisdom 2:11, "Let our strength be the law of justice." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec posse resistere eorun violentiae</span>, <span class="accented">cunctorum auxilio destitutes</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is difficult to suppose that the state of things revealed by this verse existed in the days of King Solomon, or that so powerful a monarch, and one admired for "judgment and justice" (<a href="/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>), would be content with complaining of such disorders instead of checking them. There is no token of remorse for past unprofitableness or anguish of heart at the thought of failure in duty. If we take the words as the utterance of the real Solomon, we do violence to history, and must correct the existing chronicles of his reign. The picture here presented is one of later times, and it may be of other countries. Persian rule, or the tyranny of the Ptolemies, might afford an original from which it might be taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Again,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1443;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#7687;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">observed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;er&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the oppression</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;q&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6231.htm">Strong's 6231: </a> </span><span class="str2">To press upon, oppress, defraud, violate, overflow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">taking place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">under</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8478.htm">Strong's 8478: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bottom, below, in lieu of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sun.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;me&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8121.htm">Strong's 8121: </a> </span><span class="str2">The sun, the east, a ray, a notched battlement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[I] saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
