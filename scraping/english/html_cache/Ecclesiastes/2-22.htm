In the context of Ecclesiastes, it reflects the Preacher's exploration of life's meaning and the apparent futility of human efforts. The question echoes the sentiments found in other wisdom literature, such as Job, where the purpose and reward of human endeavors are scrutinized. It invites readers to consider the ultimate gain from their work, beyond material wealth or societal status.<p><b>for all the toil and striving</b><br>The terms "toil" and "striving" emphasize the intense effort and struggle involved in human labor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, work was often physically demanding and relentless, with agriculture being a primary occupation. This phrase captures the exhaustive nature of work, which is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes. It also connects to the curse of labor in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where toil is a consequence of the Fall, highlighting the burdensome aspect of work in a fallen world.<p><b>with which he labors</b><br>This part of the verse focuses on the personal investment and energy a person puts into their work. It underscores the individual responsibility and effort required in daily tasks. The Hebrew culture placed a high value on diligence and hard work, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>, which praises the industriousness of the ant. However, Ecclesiastes questions the ultimate benefit of such labor, prompting reflection on the purpose and fulfillment derived from work.<p><b>under the sun?</b><br>The phrase "under the sun" is a key motif in Ecclesiastes, used to describe the earthly, temporal realm of human existence. It signifies the limitations and transience of life on earth, contrasting with the eternal perspective of God. This phrase invites readers to consider the futility of earthly pursuits when viewed solely from a human perspective. It aligns with the broader biblical narrative that encourages believers to seek eternal treasures, as Jesus teaches in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, rather than focusing solely on worldly achievements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects. His reflections in Ecclesiastes are often seen as a culmination of his life experiences.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigned.
