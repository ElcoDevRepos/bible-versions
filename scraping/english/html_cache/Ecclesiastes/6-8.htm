In the context of Ecclesiastes, Solomon often reflects on the limitations of human wisdom. Despite the value placed on wisdom throughout the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>), Solomon observes that both the wise and the foolish ultimately face the same fate&#8212;death (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14-16</a>). This reflects the theme of life's fleeting nature and the vanity of earthly pursuits. The rhetorical question challenges readers to consider the eternal perspective, where true wisdom is found in fearing God and keeping His commandments (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>). The New Testament echoes this sentiment, emphasizing that Christ is the ultimate wisdom from God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>).<p><b>What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?</b><br>This phrase highlights the social dynamics and the perceived value of social skills or wisdom in navigating life. In ancient Near Eastern culture, social status was significant, and the ability to conduct oneself well could lead to better opportunities. However, Solomon questions the ultimate benefit of such skills if they do not lead to eternal gain. The poor man, despite his ability to navigate social situations, remains in his poverty, illustrating the limitations of human effort. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true gain is not found in worldly success but in spiritual riches (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The phrase also points to the idea that God values the heart over outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>), and true conduct is rooted in righteousness and humility before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_man.htm">The Wise Man</a></b><br>Represents those who possess wisdom, often seen as having insight and understanding of life and its complexities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who lack wisdom, often making poor decisions and living without regard for deeper understanding or consequences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_man.htm">The Poor Man</a></b><br>In this context, refers to someone who may lack material wealth but possesses knowledge or skill in navigating social situations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, known for his wisdom and wealth, yet he reflects on the vanity of life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical backdrop of Ecclesiastes, where wisdom literature was highly valued.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>Human wisdom, while valuable, has its limitations.

Even the wisest cannot escape sickness, disappointment, aging, or death.<p>&#8226; Under the sun, the same end overtakes both (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a>). In that sense, the wise man enjoys no ultimate &#8220;advantage&#8221; that can guarantee lasting satisfaction.<p>&#8226; The question therefore exposes our tendency to look to intellect, education, or strategic planning for security. As <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a> reminds us, God will &#8220;destroy the wisdom of the wise.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By forcing us to admit that human wisdom alone cannot secure our future, Solomon steers us toward fearing God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>) rather than trusting our own cleverness (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Gain&#8221; echoes 6:7, where all human labor still &#8220;does not satisfy the appetite.&#8221; Material lack only sharpens that frustration.<p>&#8226; A poor man who is socially astute, polite, or well-mannered might expect doors to open, yet Solomon asks whether that skill truly delivers lasting benefit. Jesus makes a similar point in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a> values integrity above wealth, and <a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> calls the poor &#8220;rich in faith.&#8221; Still, those spiritual realities do not always translate into immediate relief from hardship.<p>&#8226; Therefore, neither refined etiquette nor shrewd self-presentation can break the cycle of human limitation. Only God &#8220;raises the poor from the dust&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>) and promises eternal treasure that moth and rust cannot destroy (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:8</a> asks two piercing questions to expose the emptiness of every merely human advantage. Intellectual brilliance cannot shield us from life&#8217;s futility, and social savvy cannot rescue us from material want. Both wise and fool, rich and poor, meet the same earthly end. Recognizing that reality drives us to the only secure foundation&#8212;reverent trust in the God who alone grants lasting wisdom, enduring provision, and eternal gain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">That knoweth to walk.--</span><span class= "ital">Understands how to conduct himself. </span>But why this should be limited to the poor is not obvious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For what hath the wise more fire than the fool?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. What advantage hath the wise man over the fool? This verse confirms the previous one by an interrogative argument. The same labor for support, the same unsatisfied desires, belong to all, wise or foolish; in this respect intellectual gifts have no superiority. (For a similar interrogation implying an emphatic denial, see Ecclesiastes 1:30) <span class="cmt_word">What hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?</span> The Septuagint gives the verse thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (A, C, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For what advantage hath the wise man over the fool? since the poor man knows how to walk before life?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid habet amplius sapiens a stulto? et quid pauper</span>, <span class="accented">nisi ut pergat illuc</span>, <span class="accented">ubi est vita?</span> "And what hath the poor man except that he go thither where is life?" Both these versions regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> as used in the sense of "life," and that the life beyond the grave; but this idea is foreign to the context; and the expression must be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "the living." The interpretation of the clause has much exercised critics. Plumptre adheres to that of Bernstein and others, "What advantage hath the poor over him who knows how to walk before the living?' (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the man of high birth or station, who lives in public, with the eyes of men upon him). The poor has his cares and unsatisfied desires as much as the man of culture and position. Poverty offers no protection against such assaults, But the expression, to <span class="accented">know how to walk before the living</span>, means to understand and to follow the correct path of life; to know how to behave properly and uprightly in the intercourse with one's fellow-men; to have what the French call <span class="accented">savoir vivre</span>. (So Volok.) The question must be completed thus: "What advantage has the discreet and properly conducted poor man over the fool?" None, at least in this respect. The poor man, even though he be well vetoed in the rule of life, has insatiable desires which he has to check or conceal, and so is no better off than the fool, who equally is unable to gratify them. The two 'extremities of the social scale are taken - the rich wise man, and the prudent poor man - and both are shown to fail in enjoying life; and what is true of these must be also true of all that come between these two limits, "the appetite is not filled" (ver. 7). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">advantage,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3148.htm">Strong's 3148: </a> </span><span class="str2">Superiority, advantage, excess</span><br /><br /><span class="word">then,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has the wise man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
