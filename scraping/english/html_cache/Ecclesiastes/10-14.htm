The fool's verbosity contrasts with the wise, who are measured in their speech (<a href="/proverbs/17-27.htm">Proverbs 17:27-28</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, where oral tradition was significant, the ability to speak wisely was highly valued. The fool's tendency to speak without restraint reflects a deeper spiritual and moral deficiency, as seen in <a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>, which advises believers to control their tongues.<p><b>No one knows what is coming,</b><br>This phrase underscores the theme of human limitation and the unpredictability of life, a recurring motif in Ecclesiastes. The acknowledgment of uncertainty is a call to humility, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which reminds us that life is a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. The inability to predict the future is a reminder of God's sovereignty, as only He knows the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). This perspective encourages reliance on God's wisdom rather than human understanding.<p><b>and who can tell him what will come after him?</b><br>The rhetorical question emphasizes the futility of human attempts to control or predict the future. It reflects the broader biblical narrative that only God holds the future, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>, where God reveals deep and hidden things. This phrase also connects to the theme of legacy and the uncertainty of what one leaves behind, as discussed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-19</a>. The inability to know what will come after one's life points to the need for faith and trust in God's eternal plan, as illustrated in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Ecclesiastes, the fool is someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often characterized by excessive talking and a lack of awareness of their own ignorance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom. Ecclesiastes is a reflection on the meaning of life and the pursuit of wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship and governance during Solomon's reign, often serving as the backdrop for his teachings and reflections.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_excessive_speech.htm">The Dangers of Excessive Speech</a></b><br>The fool's tendency to multiply words serves as a warning against speaking without thought or wisdom.

This should lead us to trust in God's sovereignty and plan, rather than relying on our own understanding or predictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_silence_and_listening.htm">The Value of Silence and Listening</a></b><br>In a world full of noise, learning to listen more and speak less can lead to greater wisdom and understanding.

Solomon is warning us that:<p>&#8226; A fool&#8217;s verbosity masks an empty heart. <a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a> echoes this: &#8220;When words are many, sin is unavoidable, but he who restrains his lips is wise.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Endless chatter feeds pride. <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a> urges believers to be &#8220;quick to listen, slow to speak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Silence can showcase wisdom. <a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a> notes, &#8220;Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent.&#8221;<p>The verse calls us to weigh our words carefully, letting them be few and truthful rather than many and reckless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one knows what is coming</b><p>The second line brings us face-to-face with human limitation:<p>&#8226; Our understanding of tomorrow is partial at best. <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a> warns, &#8220;Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Planning without humility invites presumption. <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a> reminds merchants who map out future profits, &#8220;You do not even know what will happen tomorrow&#8230; you ought to say, &#8216;If the Lord wills&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Trusting God, not self-confidence, is the antidote to uncertainty.

The wise therefore seek His guidance rather than broadcasting their own guesses.<p>&#8226; A sobering reminder lies in <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>: the rich man planned for years ahead, but God said, &#8220;This very night your life will be required of you.&#8221; True security rests not in forecasts but in surrender to God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a> exposes the emptiness of excessive talk and the arrogance of pretending to know the future.

(See <span class= "ital">reff.</span>) The connection here would be better seen if the clause were introduced with "and yet." The fool's courageous loquacity is contrasted with the cautious silence which experience of his ignorance has taught the wise man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool also is full of words.</span> The word for "fool" here is oaks/, which implies a dense, confused thinker. Alive the word was <span class="accented">kesil</span>, which denotes rather the self-confidence of the dull and stupid <span class="accented">man</span>. <span class="accented">Moreover the fool multiplieth words</span>. He not only speaks foolishly, but he says too much (cutup. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>). It is not mere loquacity that is here predicated of the fool, though that is one of his characteristics, but, as-the rest of the verse shows, the prating of things about which he knows nothing. He talks as though he knew everything and there were no limitation to human cognition. <span class="cmt_word">A man cannot tell what shall be</span>. And yet, or although, no man can really predict the future. The fool speaks confidently of such things, and thereby proves his imbecility. Instead of "what shall be," the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "What has been and what shall be;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid ante se fuerit</span>, "What has been before him." This reading was introduced probably to obviate a seeming tautology in the following clause, <span class="cmt_word">And what shall be after him, who can tell?</span> But this clause has a different signification from the former, and presents a closer definition. The future intended may be the result of the fool's inconsiderate language, which may have fatal and lasting consequences; or it may refer to the visitation of his sins upon his children, in accordance with the denunciation of <a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20-22</a>; or it may include the life beyond the grave.
