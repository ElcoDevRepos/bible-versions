In the context of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher observes the futility and vanity of life under the sun, emphasizing that a lack of reverence for God leads to moral and spiritual decay. The wicked, those who live in defiance of God's commandments, are contrasted with the righteous who fear God. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord, a concept echoed in <a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> and <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>. The absence of this fear results in a life devoid of divine guidance and blessing.<p><b>it will not go well with them</b><br>This phrase highlights the inevitable consequences of living a life contrary to God's will. Throughout Scripture, there is a consistent message that disobedience and rebellion against God lead to negative outcomes (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The Preacher in Ecclesiastes acknowledges the apparent prosperity of the wicked at times, but ultimately asserts that their end is not favorable. This aligns with the teachings found in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist initially envies the prosperity of the wicked but later understands their ultimate downfall. The phrase serves as a reminder of the divine justice that governs the universe, even when it seems delayed.<p><b>and their days will not lengthen like a shadow</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, shadows were often used as metaphors for transience and the brevity of life. The imagery of a shadow suggests something fleeting and insubstantial. The wicked, who do not fear God, will not experience the blessing of a long and prosperous life, as promised to those who honor God (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This phrase can be seen as a reflection on the temporal nature of earthly life and the ultimate judgment that awaits those who live in opposition to God's ways. The brevity of their days contrasts with the eternal life promised to the righteous, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>. The shadow metaphor also points to the fleeting nature of worldly success and the enduring value of spiritual integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to those who live in opposition to God's commandments and moral order.

If experience seemed often to militate against this assertion, Koheleth's faith prevailed against apparent contradictions. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow.</span> Above we read of a wicked man enjoying a long, untroubled life; here the contrary is stated. Such contradictions are seen every day. There are inscrutable reasons for the delay of judgment; but on the whole moral government is vindicated, and even the long life of a sinner is no blessing. The author of the Book of Wisdom writes (4:8), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years;" and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), <span class="accented">"The</span> sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed." Man's life is compared to a shadow because it passes away with the setting sun (see on Ecclesiastes 6:12). The Vulgate, in order to obviate the apparent discrepancy between this and the preceding verses, renders the verb in a precatory form: <span class="accented">Non sit bonum impio</span>, etc., "Let it not be well with the wicked, and let his days not be prolonged; but let them pass away as a shadow who fear not the Lord." This is quite unnecessary; and the words, <span class="accented">"as a shadow,"</span> according to the accents, belong to what precedes, as in the Authorized Version. Hitzig and others have adopted the Vulgate division, and render, "Like a shadow is he who fears not God." But there is no sufficient reason for disregarding the existing accentuation. Septuagint, "He shall not prolong his days in a shadow (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he feareth not before God</span>. This is the reason, looking to temporal retribution, why the wicked shall not live out half their days (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>).
