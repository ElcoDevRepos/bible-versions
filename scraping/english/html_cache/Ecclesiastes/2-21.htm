In the biblical context, wisdom is often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is considered a gift from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). The emphasis on labor reflects the cultural importance of work in ancient Israel, where agriculture and craftsmanship were vital for survival and prosperity. The use of "wisdom, knowledge, and skill" suggests a comprehensive approach to work, aligning with the biblical ideal of using one's God-given talents for His glory (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><b>and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the perceived injustice of wealth or achievements being transferred to someone who has not earned them. In the historical context, inheritance laws in ancient Israel often led to wealth being passed down to descendants who may not have contributed to its accumulation. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the unpredictability of life and the limitations of human control (<a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-14</a>). The notion of unearned gain can also be seen as a reminder of the grace of God, who gives salvation freely to those who have not worked for it (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>this too is futile and a great evil</b><br>The term "futile" echoes the recurring theme of vanity or meaninglessness found throughout Ecclesiastes. The Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "vanity," suggests something transient or elusive. This futility is a central theme in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the temporary nature of worldly pursuits and achievements (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>). The phrase "a great evil" underscores the moral and existential frustration that arises from such situations. It reflects the fallen state of the world, where justice and fairness are often lacking, pointing to the need for divine intervention and ultimate justice, which is fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.
