The Preacher in Ecclesiastes often reflects on the inevitability of death, which serves as a great equalizer among people. This theme is consistent with the biblical understanding that all humans, regardless of their status or actions, are subject to the same earthly end (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p><b>There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked:</b><br>The concept of a "common fate" underscores the idea that both the righteous and the wicked face death. This reflects the biblical teaching that earthly life is temporary and that ultimate justice is found in the afterlife (<a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-19</a>). The righteous may find comfort in the hope of eternal life, while the wicked face judgment (<a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>).<p><b>For the good and the bad:</b><br>This phrase reiterates the impartiality of death, which does not discriminate based on moral behavior. It challenges the notion that earthly rewards or punishments are always aligned with one's moral conduct, a theme also explored in the Book of Job.<p><b>For the clean and the unclean:</b><br>In the Old Testament, "clean" and "unclean" often refer to ceremonial purity (Leviticus 11). This distinction was significant in Jewish religious practice, yet Ecclesiastes points out that such distinctions do not alter the inevitability of death. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching that external rituals do not determine one's standing before God (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>).<p><b>For the one who sacrifices and the one who does not:</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Old Testament worship, symbolizing atonement and devotion to God (Leviticus 1-7). However, Ecclesiastes highlights that participation in religious rituals does not exempt one from death. This foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on faith and the heart's condition over ritual (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<p><b>As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner:</b><br>This phrase reinforces the theme of equality in death, regardless of one's moral standing. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, which states that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, emphasizing the need for divine grace.<p><b>As it is for the one who makes a vow, so it is for the one who refuses to take a vow:</b><br>Vows were serious commitments made to God, often involving promises of service or offerings (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). The mention of vows here suggests that even those who make solemn commitments to God face the same end as those who do not. This can be seen as a call to sincerity and integrity in one's relationship with God, rather than reliance on outward promises (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous_and_the_wicked.htm">The Righteous and the Wicked</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who live according to God's commandments and those who do not.

No one&#8212;rich or poor, powerful or powerless&#8212;escapes the same ultimate reality. <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a> reminds us, &#8220;For dust you are, and to dust you shall return,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> adds, &#8220;Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221; The repetition of this truth is a divine wake-up call: our earthly distinctions cannot shield us from the shared appointment with death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There is a common fate for the righteous and the wicked</b><p>&#8226; Righteous or wicked, everyone enters eternity through the doorway of death.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a> observes, &#8220;For all can see that the wise die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is not a denial of moral differences; it highlights the limitation of earthly justice. Eternal justice comes later (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>), but the timing of death strikes both camps alike.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the good and the bad</b><p>The verse tightens its logic: moral excellence does not grant biological exemption. <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a> says God &#8220;will repay each according to his deeds,&#8221; yet that repayment happens after life&#8217;s vapor (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>) has evaporated. On this side of the grave, goodness does not lengthen the hourglass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the clean and the unclean</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Clean&#8221; evokes ceremonial purity (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>) and personal holiness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Unclean&#8221; covers those outside covenant boundaries.<p>&#8226; Regardless of ritual status, mortality prevails. The point: even the most scrupulous worshiper cannot out-sanitize the curse of death introduced in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not</b><p>Old-covenant worshipers offered sacrifices at the temple; others stayed home. Either way, they shared the same graveyard. First Samuel 2:6 notes, &#8220;The LORD brings death and gives life.&#8221; Faithful worship is essential, yet it does not block the universal sentence pronounced in Eden.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As it is for the good, so it is for the sinner</b><p>Solomon circles back to reinforce the truth. Whether lives are marked by commendation or condemnation, <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a> still applies: &#8220;No man has power over the wind to contain it; so no one has power over the day of his death.&#8221; Only in Christ does the sinner find rescue from eternal consequence (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as it is for the one who makes a vow, so it is for the one who refuses to take a vow</b><p>&#8226; Vow-makers (<a href="/bsb/numbers/30.htm">Numbers 30</a>) pledged special devotion; non-vowers led ordinary lives.<p>&#8226; Death equalizes them. This undercuts pride in religious performance and steers every heart toward humble dependence on God&#8217;s mercy alone (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2</a> teaches that death is the unavoidable destiny shared by every person, no matter their morality, ritual purity, or religious zeal. The verse strips away illusions of earthly advantage, pressing us to prepare for what follows death rather than trust in what precedes it. By confronting our common fate, Solomon directs us to seek the only lasting hope&#8212;redemption that conquers death through the risen Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>2<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">He that sweareth.--</span><a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm" title="Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that steals shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that swears shall be cut off as on that side according to it.">Zechariah 5:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things come alike to all</span>; literally, <span class="accented">all things</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">like that which</span> [<span class="accented">happens</span>] <span class="accented">to all persons</span>. There is no difference in the treatment of persons; all people of every kind meet with circumstances of every kind. Speaking generally, there is no discrimination, apparently, in the distribution of good and evil. Sun and shade, calm and storm. fruitful and unfruitful seasons, joy and sorrow, are dispensed by inscrutable laws. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "Vanity is in all;" the Syriac unites two readings, "All before him is vanity, all as to all" (Ginsburg). <span class="cmt_word">There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</span> All men have the same lot, whether it be death or any other contingency, without regard to their naomi condition. The classes into which men are divided must be noted. "Righteous" and <span class="accented">"wicked"</span> refer to men in their conduct to others. <span class="cmt_word">The good.</span> The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac add, "to the evil," which is said again almost immediately. <span class="cmt_word">To the clean, and to the unclean</span>. "The good" and "clean" are those who are not only ceremonially pure, but, as the epithet "good" shows, are morally undefiled. <span class="cmt_word">To him that sacrificeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who attends to the externals of religion, offers the obligatory sacrifices, and brings his free-will offerings. <span class="cmt_word">The good... the sinner</span>; in the widest senses. <span class="cmt_word">He that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath</span>. He who takes an oath lightly, carelessly, or falsely (comp. <a href="/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>), is contrasted with him who regards it as a holy thing, or shrinks in awe from invoking God's Name in such a case This last idea is regarded as a late Essenic development (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 6); though something like it is found in the sermon on the mount, "I say unto you, Swear not at all," etc. (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-37</a>). Dean Plumptre, however, throws doubt on the above interpretation, owing to the fact that in all the other groups the good side is placed first; and he suggests that "he who sweareth" may be one who does his duty in this particular religiously and well (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>), and "he who fears the oath" is a man whose conscience makes him shrink from the oath of compurgation (<a href="/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-22</a>), or who is too cowardly to give his testimony in due form. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ut perjurus, its et ille qui verum dejerat</span>; and it seems unnecessary to present an entirely new view of the passage in slavish expectation of a concinnity which the author cannot be proved to have ever aimed at. The five contrasted pairs are the righteous and the wicked, the clean and the unclean, the sacrificer and the non-sacrificer, the good and the sinner, the profane swearer and the man who reverences an oath. The last clause is rendered by the Septuagint, "So is he who sweareth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) even as he who fears the oath," which is as ambiguous as the original. A cautious Greek gnome says - <p><span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> <p><span class="accented">"Avoid an oath, though justly you might swear."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It is the same</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
