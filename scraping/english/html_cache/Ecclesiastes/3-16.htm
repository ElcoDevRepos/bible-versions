"Under the sun" is a recurring phrase in Ecclesiastes, emphasizing the earthly, temporal perspective of human life. It suggests a viewpoint limited to the material world, without considering the eternal or divine perspective. This phrase sets the stage for the observations about human justice and morality.<p><b>that in the place of judgment there is wickedness</b><br>The "place of judgment" refers to courts or places where justice is expected to be administered. In ancient Israel, judges were appointed to uphold God's law, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>. However, the Preacher observes corruption and injustice, a theme echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a> and <a href="/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>, where leaders pervert justice for personal gain. This reflects the fallen nature of humanity and the pervasive influence of sin, even in institutions meant to uphold righteousness.<p><b>and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness</b><br>The "place of righteousness" could refer to religious institutions or communities where God's standards are to be upheld. Yet, the presence of wickedness here highlights the hypocrisy and moral failure within religious settings. This mirrors Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees in <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, where He condemns their outward piety but inward corruption. It underscores the biblical theme that true righteousness is a matter of the heart, not just external compliance.<br><br>This verse, in its entirety, points to the pervasive nature of sin and the need for divine intervention. It foreshadows the ultimate judgment and righteousness brought by Jesus Christ, who will establish true justice and righteousness, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom.

Doubtless there shall be a day of retribution for such iniquities; and God allows them now in order to try men and to teach them humility. Meantime man's duty and happiness consist, as before said, in making the best use of the present and improving the opportunities which God gives him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment</span>. Koheleth records his experience of the prevalence of iniquity in high places. <span class="accented">The place of judgment</span> (<span class="accented">mishat</span>); where justice is administered. The accentuation allows (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>) this to be regarded as the object of the verb. The Revised Version, with Hitzig, Ginsburg, and others, take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> as an adverbial expression equivalent to "in the place." The former is the simpler construction. "And moreover," at the commencement of the verse, looks back to ver. 10," I have seen the travail," etc. That <span class="cmt_word">wickedness</span> (<span class="accented">resha</span>) was there. On the judicial seat iniquity sat instead of justice. <span class="cmt_word">The place of righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>). "Righteousness" is the peculiar characteristic of the judge himself, as "justice" is of his decisions. <span class="cmt_word">That iniquity</span> (<span class="accented">resha</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was there</span>. The word ought to be translated "wickedness" or "iniquity" in both clauses. The Septuagint takes the abstract for the concrete, and at the end has apparently introduced a clerical error, which has been perpetuated in the Arabic and elsewhere, "And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there was the ungodly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); and the place of the righteous, there was the <span class="accented">godly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Complutensian Polyglot reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> in both places. It is impossible to harmonize these statements of oppression and injustice here and elsewhere (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:9, 10</a>) with Solomon's authorship of the book. It is contrary to fact that such a corrupt state of things existed in his time, and in writing thus he would be uttering a libel against himself. If he was cognizant of such evils in his kingdom, he had nothing to do but to put them down with a high hand. There is nothing to lead to the belief that he is speaking of other countries and other times; he is stating his own personal experience of what goes on around him. It is true that in Solomon's latter days disaffection secretly prevailed, and the people felt his yoke grievous (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>); but there is no evidence of the existence of corruption in judicial courts, or of the social and political evils of which he speaks in this book. That he had a prophetical for, sight of the disasters that would accompany the reign of his successor, and endeavors herein to provide consolation for the future sufferers, is a pious opinion without historical basis, and cannot be justly used to support the genuineness of the work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Furthermore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
