This phrase underscores the importance of the following insight, suggesting it is a distilled truth from his experiences and observations. In the broader context of Ecclesiastes, the search for meaning and the limitations of human wisdom are recurring themes.<p><b>I have discovered that God made mankind upright:</b><br>This phrase reflects the biblical teaching of humanity's original state of righteousness and innocence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>, where God declares His creation "very good." The term "upright" suggests moral integrity and alignment with God's will. This aligns with the doctrine of the imago Dei, the belief that humans were created in the image of God, possessing inherent dignity and moral capacity.<p><b>but they have sought out many schemes:</b><br>Here, the text shifts to humanity's deviation from their original state. The word "schemes" implies plans or devices that are often self-serving or deceitful. This reflects the biblical narrative of the Fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where Adam and Eve's disobedience introduced sin into the world. The phrase suggests a propensity for moral corruption and the pursuit of self-interest, echoing themes found in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-23</a>, where humanity's rejection of God leads to futile thinking and idolatry. This deviation from uprightness is a central theme in the biblical understanding of sin and its consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom.

Recognizing this contrast points us away from our own schemes and back to the God who first made us upright and still offers to make us new in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lo, this only</span> (or, <span class="accented">only see! this</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>have I found</span>.

Man has thus abased his free-will, and employed the inventive faculty with which he was endowed in excoriating evil (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). How this state of things came about, how the originally good man became thus wicked, the writer does not tell. He knows from revelation that God made him upright; he knows from experience that he is now evil; and he leaves the matter there.
