In the context of Ecclesiastes, it reflects the ongoing struggle and toil of human life under the sun. The phrase "all his days" suggests a lifetime of experience, echoing the theme of life's fleeting and often burdensome nature as seen throughout the book. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of human life being marked by labor and toil since the fall in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>.<p><b>he eats in darkness</b><br>Eating in darkness symbolizes a life devoid of joy and understanding. In biblical times, darkness often represented ignorance, evil, or despair (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The act of eating, a basic necessity, done in darkness suggests a lack of fulfillment and enlightenment. This can be contrasted with the imagery of light in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the "light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), offering hope and clarity.<p><b>with much sorrow</b><br>Sorrow here indicates deep emotional pain and dissatisfaction. The Hebrew word used can also imply grief or vexation. This reflects the Preacher's observation of life's vanity and the emotional toll it takes on individuals. The theme of sorrow is prevalent in Ecclesiastes, as the pursuit of worldly pleasures and achievements often leads to disappointment (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>).<p><b>sickness</b><br>Sickness can be understood both physically and metaphorically. It may refer to the physical ailments that accompany a life of hard labor and stress, or it could symbolize spiritual and emotional malaise. In the ancient Near East, sickness was often seen as a consequence of sin or divine displeasure, though the book of Job challenges this simplistic view. The presence of sickness underscores the frailty and imperfection of human existence.<p><b>and anger</b><br>Anger here may refer to frustration with life's injustices and the seeming futility of human efforts. It reflects the emotional response to the perceived inequities and unpredictability of life. This anger can be seen as a natural reaction to the vanity and fleeting nature of worldly pursuits, as discussed throughout Ecclesiastes. The Bible elsewhere advises against letting anger lead to sin (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>), suggesting a need for divine perspective and patience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. Ecclesiastes is often seen as a reflection on the meaning of life and the pursuit of fulfillment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to which Solomon belonged and over which he reigned. The cultural and religious context of Israel during Solomon's time influences the themes of Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who explores the vanity of life and the pursuit of meaning.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_labor_without_god.htm">The Futility of Labor Without God</a></b><br><a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a> highlights the emptiness and sorrow that accompany a life focused solely on material gain.

Solomon has just observed that a man who hoards wealth &#8220;is deprived of enjoyment&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:13&#8211;16</a>), and now he adds another layer of misery. Like the warning in <a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a> that riches &#8220;sprout wings,&#8221; this &#8220;moreover&#8221; stacks yet one more burden on the soul who lives for stuff rather than for God (see also <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all his days</b><p>This is not an occasional slump; it is the steady state of a life disconnected from its Maker. <a href="/psalms/90-9.htm">Psalm 90:9</a> laments, &#8220;All our days pass away in Your wrath,&#8221; underscoring that apart from divine fellowship every sunrise simply restarts the same empty loop (<a href="/ecclesiastes/6-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he eats</b><p>Eating should be one of life&#8217;s basic joys&#8212;&#8220;everyone should eat and drink and find satisfaction&#8221; as a gift from God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>). Here, even the daily meal is hollow. The apostle later teaches, &#8220;Whether you eat or drink&#8230;do all to the glory of God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). When the glory of God is absent, even bite-sized routines become burdens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in darkness</b><p>Darkness pictures separation from light, truth, and hope (<a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>). Jesus warns, &#8220;Walk while you have the Light&#8230;so that darkness will not overtake you&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>).

Even worldly grief &#8220;produces death&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>) because it never resolves into repentance and joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sickness</b><p>The Hebrew mindset links body and soul; spiritual malaise often drips into physical symptoms (<a href="/job/7-5.htm">Job 7:5</a>). Covenant curses warned that rebellion would bring &#8220;extraordinary plagues&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59-60</a>). While not every illness is a direct judgment, Solomon notes that chronic discontent can gnaw away at health.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and anger</b><p>Bitterness is the final spice on this miserable plate. &#8220;Refrain from anger and forsake wrath&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-8.htm">Psalm 37:8</a>), yet the joyless heart erupts in irritability.

The verse warns that prosperity without God breeds perpetual misery. Real contentment comes only by receiving everyday gifts&#8212;food, work, relationships&#8212;as gracious tokens from the Creator and enjoying them in the light of His presence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) We pass without notice some variations of translation in this verse, which do not materially affect the sense.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - The misery that accompanies the rich man's whole life is summed up here, where one has to think chiefly of his distress after his loss of fortune. <span class="cmt_word">All his days also he eateth in darkness</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. passes his life in gloom and cheerlessness. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, "all his days," is the accusative of time, not the object of the verb. To eat in darkness is not a common metaphor for spending a gloomy life, but it is a very natural one, and has analogies in this book (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, etc.), and in such phrases as to "sit in darkness" (<a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a>), and to "<span class="accented">walk</span> in darkness" (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>). The Septuagint, reading differently, translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "Yea, and all his days are in darkness and in mourning." But the other versions reject this alteration, and few modern commentators adopt it. <span class="cmt_word">And he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and much vexation</span>, <span class="accented">and sickness</span>, <span class="accented">and wrath</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he is sore vexed</span>, <span class="accented">and hath sickness and wrath</span>. Delitzsch takes the last words as an exclamation, "And oh for his sorrow and hatred!" The man experiences all kinds of vexation when his plans fail or involve him in trouble and privation; or he is morbid and diseased in mind and body; or he is angry and envious when others succeed better than himself. The sentiment is expressed by St. Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) in destruction and perdition." "For," he proceeds, "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) with many sorrows." The Septuagint continues its version, "And in much passion (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) and in infirmity and wrath." The anger may be directed against himself, as he thinks of his folly in taking all this trouble for nothing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moreover,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(gam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
