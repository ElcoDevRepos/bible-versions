In ancient times, travel was perilous, with uneven paths and potential threats from robbers or wild animals. As people age, their physical strength and confidence diminish, making them more cautious and fearful of such dangers. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human frailty and the need for reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a>, which speaks of not forsaking the elderly.<p><b>when the almond tree blossoms</b><br>The almond tree is one of the first to bloom in Israel, with its white blossoms symbolizing the onset of old age, akin to graying hair. This imagery is used to convey the inevitability of aging. The almond tree's early bloom can also be seen as a reminder of the brevity of life, echoing themes found in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears briefly and then vanishes.<p><b>the grasshopper loses its spring</b><br>The grasshopper, known for its agility and vitality, losing its ability to leap signifies the loss of physical vigor in old age. This imagery highlights the decline in energy and mobility that accompanies aging. The grasshopper's transformation can be paralleled with the biblical concept of human life being transient and fragile, as expressed in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, where human life is compared to grass that withers.<p><b>and the caper berry shrivels</b><br>The caper berry, often associated with appetite and desire, shriveling represents the diminishing of life's pleasures and desires in old age. This decline in physical and sensual appetites underscores the theme of life's fleeting nature and the ultimate return to God. The caper berry's shriveling can be linked to the idea of earthly desires fading, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, which speaks of the world and its desires passing away.<p><b>for then man goes to his eternal home</b><br>This phrase refers to the inevitability of death and the transition to the afterlife. The "eternal home" suggests a belief in life beyond death, aligning with the biblical promise of eternal life for believers, as found in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>, where Jesus speaks of preparing a place for His followers. This concept emphasizes the transient nature of earthly life and the hope of eternal communion with God.<p><b>and mourners walk the streets</b><br>The presence of mourners in the streets reflects the cultural practice of public mourning in ancient Israel, where the community would express grief for the deceased. This public display of sorrow underscores the communal aspect of life and death, as well as the impact of an individual's passing on their community. The mourning process is a reminder of the shared human experience of loss, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>, which encourages believers to mourn with those who mourn.<div

Each image&#8212;fear of heights, white hair, stiff limbs, diminished desire&#8212;reveals the Creator&#8217;s orderly progression of life. The culmination is not hopeless: it points to an eternal dwelling prepared by God. Recognizing these realities urges gratitude for youthful vigor, compassion for the aging, and, above all, readiness for the eternal home secured through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The old man is beset with terrors; terrors from on high, terrors on the way: all in which he had taken delight before, has charms for him no longer; the almond causes loathing (for so may be translated the word rendered "flourished" in our version); the locust, in the East a favourite article of food, is now burdensome; the caper berry (translated "desire" in our version) fails; for man is going to his everlasting house, &c<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high</span>. There is no "when" in the original, which runs, "Also, or yea, they fear on high." "They" are old men, or, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, "people" indefinitely; and the clause says that they find difficulty in mounting an ascent, as the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">Excelsa</span> <span class="accented">quoque timebant</span>. Shortness of breath, asthmatic tendencies, failure of muscular power, make such an exertion arduous and burdensome, just as in the previous verse a similar cause rendered singing impossible. The description is now arriving at the last stage, and allegorizing the closing scene. The steep ascent is the <span class="accented">via dolorosa</span>, the painful process of dying, from which the natural man shrinks; for as the gnome says - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span><br /><span class="accented">"None dotes on life more than the aged man."</span> The old man is going on the appointed road, <span class="cmt_word">and fears shall be in the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">all sorts of fears</span> (plural of intensity) <span class="accented">are in the path</span>; as in his infirm condition he can walk nowhere without danger of meeting with some accident, so analogously, as he contemplates his end and the road he has to travel, "fearfulness and trembling come upon him, and horror overwhelms him" (<a href="/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5</a>). Plumptre sees in these clauses a further adumbration of the inconveniences of old age, how that the decrepit man makes mountains of mole-hills, is full of imaginary terrors, always forecasting sad events, and so on; but this does not carry on the picture to the end which the poet has now in view, and seems tame and commonplace. The supporters of the storm-theory explain the passage as denoting the fears of the people at what is coming from on high - the gathering tempest, these fears extending to those on the highway, - which is feeble. <span class="cmt_word">And the almond tree shall flourish</span>; or, <span class="accented">is in blossom</span>. The old man is thus figured from the observed aspect of this tree. It blossoms in winter upon a leafless stem, and its flowers, at first of a pale pink color, turn to a snowy whiteness as they fall from the branches. The tree thus becomes a fit type of the arid, torpid-looking old man with his white hair. So Wright quotes Virgil, 'AEneid,' 5:416 - <p><span class="foreign">"Temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus;ETT*> <p>though there the idea is rather of mingled black and grey hair than of ahead of snowy whiteness. Canon Tristram ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 332), referring to the usual version of this clause, adds, "But the better interpretation seems to be, that as the almond blossom ushers in the spring, so do the signs referred to in the context indicate the <span class="accented">hastening</span> (<span class="accented">shaked</span>, 'almond,' meaning also 'hasten') of old age and death." Plumptre adopts the notion that the name of the tree is derived from a stem meaning <span class="accented">"to watch,"</span> and that thus it may be called <span class="accented">the early-waking tree</span> (see <a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>), the enigmatic phrase describing the wakefulness that often attends old age. But this seems a refinement by no means justified by the use of the word. Others find in the verb the signification <span class="accented">"to</span> disdain, loathe," and explain that the old man has lost his taste for almond nuts, which <span class="accented">seems to be</span> an unnecessary observation after the previous allusions to his toothless condition, the cracking and eating of such things requiring the grinders to be in perfect order. The versions are unanimous in translating the clause as the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">Vulgate, fiorebit amygdalus</span>. (So Verier. and the Syriac.) Wright takes this clause and the next to indicate the opening of spring, when nature reawakens from its winter sleep, and the dying man can no longer respond to the call or enjoy the happy season. The expositors who adhere to the notion of the storm would translate, "the almond shall be rejected," alluding to fear taking away appetite; but the rendering is faulty. <span class="cmt_word">And the grasshopper shall he a burden.</span> <span class="accented">Chagab</span>, rendered "grasshopper" here and <a href="/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, etc., is rightly translated "locust" in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15</a>. It is one of the smaller species of the insect, as is implied by its use in <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, where from the height of heaven the inhabitants of earth are regarded as <span class="accented">chagabim</span>. The clause is usually explained to mean that the very lightest burden is troublesome to old age, or that the hopping and chirping of these insects annoy the querulous senior. But who does not see the incongruity of expressing the disinclination for labor and exertion by the figure of finding a grasshopper too heavy to carry? Who would think of carrying a grasshopper? Plumptre, who discovers Greek allusions in the most unlikely places, sees here an intimation of the writer's acquaintance with the Athenians' custom of wearing a golden grasshopper on their heads as a token that they were <span class="accented">autochthones</span>, "sprung from the soil." Few will be disposed to concur with this opinion. Ginsburg and others consider that Koheleth is regarding the locust as an article of food, which it was and still is in the East (<a href="/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21, 22</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). In some places it is esteemed a great delicacy, and is cooked and prepared in a variety of ways. So here the writer is supposed to mean that dainties shall tempt in vain; even the much-esteemed locust shall be loathed. But we cannot imagine this article of food, which indeed was neither general nor at all seasons procurable, being singled out as an appetizing esculent. The solution of the enigma must be sought elsewhere. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">imping</span>, <span class="accented">uabitur locusts</span>, "the locust grows fat. Founded on this rendering is the opinion which considers that under this figure is depicted the corpulence or dropsical swelling that sometimes accompanies advanced life. But this morbid and abnormal condition could not be introduced into a typical description of the usual accompaniments of age, even if the verb could be rightly translated as the Greek and Latin versions give it, which is more than doubtful. Delitzsch, after some Jewish interpreters, considers that under the term "locust" is meant the loins or hips, or <span class="accented">caput femoris</span>, which is thus named" because it includes in itself the mechanism which the two-membered foot for springing, placed at an acute angle, presents in the locust." The poet is thought to allude to the loss of elasticity in the hips and the inability to bear any weight. We cannot agree to the propriety of this artificial explanation, which seems to have been invented to account for the expressions in the text, rather than to be founded on fact. But though we reject this elucidation of the figure, we think Delitzsch and some others are right in taking the verb in the sense of "to move heavily, to crawl along." "The locust crawls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old man drags his limbs heavily and painfully along, like the locust just hatched in early spring, and as yet not furnished with wings, which makes it8 way clumsily and slowly. The analogy derives another feature from the fact, well attested, that the appearance of the locust was synchronous with the days considered most fatal to old people, namely, the seven at the end of January and the beginning of February. So we now have the figure of the old man with his snow-white hair, panting and gasping, creeping painfully to his grave. One more <span class="accented">trait is</span> added. <span class="cmt_word">And desire shall fail.</span> The word rendered "desire" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is found nowhere else in the Old Testament, and its meaning is disputed. The Authorized Version has adopted the rendering of some of the Jewish commentators (and that of Venet., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but, according to Delitzsch, the feminine form of the noun precludes the notion of an abstract quality, and the etymology on which it rests is doubtful. Nor would it be likely that, having employed symbolism hitherto throughout his description, the writer would suddenly drop metaphor and speak in unfigurative language. We are, therefore, driven to rely for its meaning on the old versions, which would convey the traditionary idea. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">capparis</span>, by which is designated the caper tree or berry, probably the same as the hyssop, which is found throughout the East, and was extensively used as a provocative of appetite, a stimulant and restorative. Accordingly, the writer is thought here to be intimating that even stimulants, such as the caper, affect the old man no longer, cannot give zest to or make him enjoy his food. Here, again, the figurative is dropped, and a literal, unvarnished fact is stated, which mars the perfection of the picture. But the verb here used (<span class="accented">parar</span>) is capable of another signification, and is often found in the unmetaphorical sense of "breaking" or "bursting;" so the clause will run, "and the caper berry bursts." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dissipabitur capparis</span>. The fruit of this plant, when overripe, bursts open and falls off - a fit image of the dissolution of the aged frame, now ripe for the tomb, and showing evident tokens of decay. By this interpretation the symbolism is maintained, which perhaps is further illustrated by the fact that the fruit hangs down and droops from the end of long stalks, as the man bows his head and stoops his back to meet the coming death. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man goeth to his long home</span>. This and the following clause are parenthetical, ver. 6 resuming the allegory. It is as though Koheleth said - Such is the way, such are the symptoms, when decay and death are approaching; all these things happen, all these signs meet the eye, at such & period. "His long home;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (Septuagint), "to the house of his eternity," "his everlasting habitation," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grave, or Hades. There is a similar expression in Tobit 3:6, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which in the Hebrew editions of that book is given as, "Gather me to my father, to the house appointed for all living," with which Canon Churton (<span class="accented">in lot</span>.) compares <a href="/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>; <a href="/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>. So <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a> (according to many versions), "Their graves are their houses for ever." The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a> are a periphrasis for life in heaven. Diodorus Siculus notes that the Egyptians used the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of Hades (2. 51; 1. 93). The expression, "domus eterna," appears at Rome on tombs, as Plumptre observes, both in Christian and non-Christian inscriptions; and the Assyrians name the world or state beyond the grave "the house of eternity" ('Records of the Past,' 1:143). From the expression in the text nothing can be deduced concerning Koheleth's eschatological views. He is speaking here merely phenomenally. Men live their little span upon the earth, and then go to what in comparison of this is an eternity. Much of the difficulty about <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., would be obviated if critics would remember that the meaning of such words is conditioned by the context, that e.g. "everlasting" applied to a mountain and to God cannot be understood in the same, sense. <span class="cmt_word">And the mourners go about the streets</span>. This can hardly mean that the usual funeral rites have begun; for the death is not conceived as having already taken place; this is reserved for ver. 7. Nor can it, therefore, refer to the relations and friends who are sorrowing for the departed. The persons spoken of must be the mourners who are hired to play and sing at funerals (see <a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>). These were getting ready to ply their trade, expecting hourly the old man's death. So the Romans had their <span class="accented">praeficae</span>, and persons "qui conducti plorant in funere" (Horace, 'Ars Poet.,' 431). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[when]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(gam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[men] fear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1464;&#1433;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the heights</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;&#1468;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mig&#183;g&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;ah)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
