In biblical times, youth were often seen as inexperienced, yet this passage highlights that wisdom can be found in unexpected places. The Bible frequently elevates wisdom as a divine gift (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The mention of a "poor" youth suggests humility and openness to learning, qualities that are esteemed in Scripture (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). This contrasts with the worldly view that equates wealth with success.<p><b>than an old but foolish king</b><br>The contrast here is stark: age and position do not guarantee wisdom. In ancient Israel, kings were expected to lead with discernment and justice, as seen in the reign of Solomon, who initially asked God for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). However, the term "foolish" indicates a departure from godly wisdom, which can lead to downfall, as seen in the later years of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). This serves as a warning against complacency and pride.<p><b>who no longer knows how to take a warning</b><br>This phrase underscores the danger of ignoring counsel and correction. In the biblical context, prophets often served as God's messengers to warn kings and nations (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>). A king who refuses to heed warnings is likened to those who harden their hearts against God (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate wise king, always receptive to the will of the Father (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>). The inability to accept correction is a sign of spiritual decline and is cautioned against throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_youth.htm">Wise Youth</a></b><br>Represents someone who, despite lacking material wealth, possesses wisdom and the ability to learn and grow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/old_foolish_king.htm">Old Foolish King</a></b><br>Symbolizes a person in a position of power who has become complacent, resistant to advice, and unable to heed warnings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was a king known for his wisdom, which adds depth to the contrast between wisdom and folly in leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Solomon reigned, providing a historical context for understanding the dynamics of leadership and wisdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/warnings.htm">Warnings</a></b><br>Implies the presence of advisors or circumstances that offer guidance, which the foolish king fails to acknowledge.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_wisdom_over_wealth_and_power.htm">Value of Wisdom Over Wealth and Power</a></b><br>True wisdom is more valuable than material wealth or high status.

The clause says that a youth who is clever and adroit, though sprung from a sordid origin, is better off than a king who has not learned wisdom with his years, and who, it is afterwards implied, is dethroned by this young man. <span class="cmt_word">Who will no more be admonished</span>; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more</span>.

The words will bear this translation, and it accords with one view of the author's meaning (see below); but that given above is more suitable to the interpretation of the paragraph which approves itself to us. The sentence is of general import, and may be illustrated by a passage from the Book of Wisdom (4. 8, 9), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by length of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age." So Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 18:62, "Non cant nee rugae repente auctoritatem arripere possunt, sod honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit aactoritatis extremes." Some have thought that Solomon is here speaking of himself, avowing his folly and expressing his contrition, in view of his knowledge of Jeroboam's delegation to the kingdom - the crafty youth of poor estate (<a href="/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>, etc.), whom the Prophet Ahijah had warned of approaching greatness. But there is nothing in the recorded history of Solomon to make probable such expression of self-abasement, and our author could never have so completely misrepresented him. Here, too, is another proof that Ecclesiastes is not written by Solomon himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Better</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mis&#183;k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4542.htm">Strong's 4542: </a> </span><span class="str2">Indigent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
