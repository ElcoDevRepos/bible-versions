In the context of Ecclesiastes, it reflects the Preacher's (traditionally Solomon) advice to embrace life despite its uncertainties. The call to "go" implies a departure from passivity and an engagement with the present moment, aligning with the biblical theme of living purposefully (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15-16</a>).<p><b>Eat your bread with joy</b><br>Eating bread symbolizes the basic sustenance of life. In ancient Israel, bread was a staple, representing God's provision (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). The emphasis on joy suggests a heart of gratitude and contentment, echoing the sentiment found in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>, where Paul speaks of being content in all circumstances. This joy is not merely emotional but a deep-seated satisfaction in God's provision.<p><b>And drink your wine with a cheerful heart</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a common beverage, often associated with celebration and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The cheerful heart indicates a state of inner peace and satisfaction, which is a gift from God (<a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>). This phrase encourages believers to enjoy God's gifts responsibly, reflecting the joy of the Lord as their strength (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>).<p><b>For God has already approved your works</b><br>This assurance of divine approval suggests that God delights in His creation enjoying life within His ordained boundaries. It reflects the biblical principle that God takes pleasure in the well-being of His servants (<a href="/psalms/35-27.htm">Psalm 35:27</a>). Theologically, it points to the idea that righteous living, in accordance with God's will, is pleasing to Him (<a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>). This approval is not based on human merit but on living in alignment with God's purposes, reminiscent of the approval seen in the life of Jesus, who always did what pleased the Father (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

God &#8220;looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>). His benevolent verdict invites His people to enjoy life&#8217;s gifts.<p>&#8226; Under the sun, achievements may seem fleeting (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>), yet when lived in reverent trust, they bear God&#8217;s &#8220;Well done&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<p>&#8226; New-covenant believers stand justified by faith (<a href="/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>), so our labor is &#8220;not in vain in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).<p>&#8226; Confidence in God&#8217;s approval liberates us from asceticism and anxiety; we can work diligently and celebrate freely, knowing our lives please Him when aligned with His will (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a> urges purposeful, grateful enjoyment of God&#8217;s daily gifts.

The inscrutability of the moral government of the world, the uncertainty of life, the condition of the dead, lead to the conclusion again that one should use one's life to the best advantage; and Koheleth repeats his caution concerning the issues and duration of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy</span>. This is not an injunction to lead a selfish life of Epicurean pleasure; but taking the limited view to which he here confines himself, the Preacher inculcates the practical wisdom of looking at the bright side of things; he says in effect (though he takes care afterwards to correct a wrong impression which might be given)," Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>). We have had the same counsel in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Drink thy wine with a merry heart</span>. Wine was not an accompaniment of meals usually; it -was reserved for feasts and solemn occasions. Bread and wine are here regarded as the necessary means of support and comfort (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>; <a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>, etc.). The moderate use of wine is nowhere forbidden; there is no law in the Old Testament against the use of intoxicating drinks; the employment of such fluids as cordials, exhilarating, strengthening and comforting, is often referred to (comp. <a href="/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>; Ecclus. 31:27, 28). Thus Koheleth's advice, taken even literally, is not contrary to the spirit of his religion. <span class="cmt_word">For God now</span> (<span class="accented">long ago</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>accepteth thy works</span>. The "works" are not moral or religious doings, in reward of which God gives temporal blessings, which is plainly opposed to Koheleth's chief contention in all this passage. The works are the eating and drinking just mentioned. By the constitution of man's nature, and by the ordering of Providence, such capacity of enjoyment is allowable, and there need be no scruple in using it. Such things are God's good gifts, and to be received with reverence and thanksgiving; and he who thus employs them is well-pleasing unto the Lord (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>;
