The phrase "under the sun" is a key theme in Ecclesiastes, indicating life from a purely earthly perspective, without considering the divine or eternal. Solomon, known for his wisdom and wealth, had the means to explore all aspects of life, from pleasure to work, and his experiences lend authority to his observations. The phrase suggests a thorough examination of human endeavors, emphasizing the limitations of human understanding when disconnected from God.<p><b>and have found them all to be futile</b><br>The term "futile" is often translated as "vanity" or "meaningless" in other versions, capturing the Hebrew word "hevel," which implies something transient or elusive, like vapor. This reflects the temporary and unsatisfying nature of worldly pursuits when they are ends in themselves. The futility of human efforts is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, highlighting the limitations of human wisdom and achievement. This perspective aligns with the biblical teaching that true meaning and fulfillment are found in God alone, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5-6</a> and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which also speak to the fleeting nature of life.<p><b>a pursuit of the wind</b><br>This metaphor illustrates the impossibility and frustration of trying to grasp or control something as intangible as the wind. It underscores the idea that human efforts, when focused solely on earthly matters, are ultimately unproductive and unsatisfying. The imagery of chasing the wind conveys a sense of futility and endless striving without achieving lasting results. This concept is echoed in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/41-29.htm">Isaiah 41:29</a> and <a href="/hosea/12.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>, where the pursuit of idols or false hopes is likened to chasing the wind. The phrase serves as a poignant reminder of the need for a divine perspective to find true purpose and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of worship and governance during Solomon's reign, representing the height of Israel's power and prosperity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth from a human perspective, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_pursuits.htm">The Futility of Earthly Pursuits</a></b><br>Solomon's observation that "all is vanity" challenges us to evaluate our priorities and the ultimate purpose of our endeavors.

Solomon&#8217;s firsthand survey of life under the sun drives us to look above the sun, where meaning is anchored in the Creator and His eternal purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Vexation.</span>--The word occurs only in this book (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm" title="Then I looked on all the works that my hands had worked, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 2:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-17.htm" title="Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:17</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm" title="For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm" title="Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm" title="Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-9.htm" title="Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.">Ecclesiastes 6:9</a>). The A. V. translation, "vexation of spirit," is difficult to justify. Very nearly the same phrase occurs in <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm" title="Ephraim feeds on wind, and follows after the east wind: he daily increases lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.">Hosea 12:1</a>, and is there translated "feeding on wind," for in Hebrew, as in some other languages, the name for "spirit" primarily denotes breath or wind. Accordingly many interpreters understand the phrase of the text "feeding on wind" (see <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm" title="He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?">Isaiah 44:20</a>). The same root, however, which means to "feast on a thing," has the secondary meaning to "delight in a thing," and so the corresponding noun in Chaldee comes to mean "pleasure" or "will." (Comp. <a href="/ezra/5-17.htm" title="Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-18.htm" title="And whatever shall seem good to you, and to your brothers, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.">Ezra 7:18</a>.) Accordingly the LXX. and many modern interpreters understand the phrase of the text "effort after wind." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Here is the result of this examination of human actions. <span class="cmt_word">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun.</span> In his varied experience nothing had escaped his notice. <span class="cmt_word">And behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit</span>; <span class="accented">reuth ruach</span>; <span class="accented">afflictio spiritus</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "choice of spirit," or, "wind" (Septuagint); <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Aquila and Theodotion); <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "feeding on wind" (Symmachus). This last translation, or "striving after wind," seems to be most agreeable to the etymology of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, which, except in this book (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:11, 17, 26</a>, etc.), occurs elsewhere only in the Chaldee portion of Ezra (<a href="/ezra/5-17.htm">Ezra 5:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-18.htm">Ezra 7:18</a>). Whichever sense is taken, the import is much the same. What is implied is the unsubstantial and unsatisfying nature of human labors and endeavors. Many compare <a href="/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>, "Ephraim feedeth on wind," and <a href="/isaiah/44-20.htm">Isaiah 44:20</a>, "He feedeth on ashes." In contrast, perhaps, to this constantly recurring complaint, the author of the Book of Wisdom teaches that murmuring is unprofitable and blasphemous (Wisd. 1:11). Bailey, in 'Festus,' sings - <p><span class="accented">"Of all life's aims, what's worth the thought we waste on't?<br />How mean, how miserable, seems every care!<br />How doubtful, too, the system of the mind!<br />And then the ceaseless, changeless, hopeless round<br />Of weariness, and heartlessness, and woe,<br />And vice, and vanity!
