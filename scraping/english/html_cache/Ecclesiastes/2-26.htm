In the Old Testament, being pleasing to God often involved obedience to His commandments and living a life of righteousness. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, which speaks of the Lord delighting in the way of a righteous person. The idea of being pleasing to God is also seen in the New Testament, where faith and obedience are central to a life that honors God (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><b>He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy</b><br>Wisdom, knowledge, and joy are seen as gifts from God, granted to those who live according to His will. In the biblical context, wisdom is not merely intellectual knowledge but a deep understanding of God's ways and purposes. <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> states that the Lord gives wisdom, and from His mouth come knowledge and understanding. Joy, as a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>), is a profound sense of well-being and contentment that comes from a relationship with God, transcending circumstances.<p><b>but to the sinner He assigns the task of gathering and accumulating</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the futility of a life lived apart from God. The sinner, in biblical terms, is one who lives in rebellion against God's laws. The task of gathering and accumulating wealth or possessions is portrayed as ultimately meaningless without God's blessing. This reflects the broader theme of Ecclesiastes, which often contrasts the temporary nature of earthly pursuits with the eternal value of spiritual ones.<p><b>that which he will hand over to one who pleases God</b><br>This phrase suggests a divine redistribution of wealth and resources, where the efforts of the sinner ultimately benefit those who are righteous. This concept is seen in <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>, which states that the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous. It underscores the biblical principle that God is sovereign over all things, including the distribution of material wealth.<p><b>This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind</b><br>The conclusion of the verse reiterates the theme of vanity and the fleeting nature of earthly endeavors. The phrase "pursuit of the wind" is a metaphor for the elusive and unsatisfying nature of worldly pursuits without God. This echoes the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which repeatedly emphasizes the emptiness of life apart from a relationship with God. The book encourages readers to seek fulfillment in God rather than in temporal achievements or possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive writings. Ecclesiastes reflects his reflections on the meaning of life and the pursuit of fulfillment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>, God is portrayed as the ultimate source of wisdom, knowledge, and joy. The verse emphasizes His sovereignty in distributing these gifts according to His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are pleasing to God, often characterized by their faithfulness and obedience.

To the man that finds favor in God's sight (<a href="/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who pleases him, ha gives blessings, while he withholds them or takes them away from the man who displeases him.

(more worthy) hands. Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:14. 25 - "Absumet heres Caecuba dignior Servata centum clavibus." The moral government of God is here recognized, as below, <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15, 17</a>, etc., and a further thought is added on the subject of retribution: <span class="cmt_word">That he may give to him that is good before God</span>. This idea is found in <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>, "He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase, gathereth it for him that hath pity upon the poor;" and Ecclesiastes 13:22, "The wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous" (comp. <a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16, 17</a>). So in the parable of the talents, the talent of the unprofitable servant is given unto him who had made best use of his money (<a href="/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This also is vanity</span>. It is a question what is the reference here. Delitzsch considers it to be the striving after pleasure in and from labor (ver. 24); Knobel, the arbitrary distribution of the good things of this life; but, put thus baldly, this could hardly be termed a "feeding on wind;" nor could that expression be applied to the "gifts of God" to which Bullock confines the reference. Wright, Hengstenberg, Gratz, and others deem that what is meant is the collecting and heaping up of riches by the sinner, which has already been decided to be vanity (vers. 11, 17, 18); and this Would limit the general conclusion to a particular instance. Taking the view contained in ver. 24 as the central idea of the passage, we see that Koheleth feels that the restriction upon man's enjoyment of labor imposed by God's moral government makes that toil vain because its issue is not in men's hands, and it is a striving for or a feeding on wind because the result is unsatisfying and vanishes in the grasp. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
