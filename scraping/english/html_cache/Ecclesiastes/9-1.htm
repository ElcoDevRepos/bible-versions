This introspective approach is consistent with the wisdom literature style, where personal experience and observation lead to broader truths. The phrase suggests a careful consideration of life's complexities and uncertainties, a theme prevalent throughout Ecclesiastes.<p><b>that the righteous and the wise, as well as their deeds, are in God&#8217;s hands.</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty over human affairs, a central tenet in biblical theology. The righteous and wise are often seen as those who live according to God's commandments, yet their outcomes are ultimately determined by God. This reflects the biblical understanding that human efforts are subject to divine will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps." The phrase also implies a sense of security and trust in God's providence, despite life's unpredictability.<p><b>Man does not know what lies ahead,</b><br>This highlights human limitations in understanding the future, a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which reminds believers of the uncertainty of life. The unpredictability of future events underscores the need for reliance on God, who alone knows the future. This acknowledgment of human ignorance serves as a call to humility and faith.<p><b>whether love or hate.</b><br>The mention of love and hate represents the spectrum of human experiences and emotions. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, these terms could encompass a wide range of relational dynamics and outcomes. The uncertainty of experiencing love or hate in the future emphasizes the unpredictability of life and relationships. This duality also reflects the broader biblical narrative of human life being subject to both blessings and trials, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Job, who experienced both divine favor and suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally identified as Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, who is considered the author of Ecclesiastes.

The reference is both to what has been said and to what is coming. The <span class="accented">ki</span>, "for" (which the Vulgate omits), at the beginning gives the reason for the truth of what is advanced; the writer has omitted no means of arriving at a conclusion. One great result of his consideration he proceeds to state. The Septuagint connects this clause closely with the last verse of the preceding chapter, "For I applied all this to my heart, and my heart saw all this." The righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God (<a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his power, under his direction. Man is not independent. Even the good and wise, who might be supposed to afford the plainest evidence of the favorable side of God's moral government, are subject to the same unsearchable law. The very incomprehensibility of this principle proves that it comes from God, and men may well be content to submit themselves to it, knowing that he is as just as he is almighty. <span class="cmt_word">No man knoweth either love or hatred.</span> God's favor or displeasure are meant. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et tamen nescit homo, utrum amore an odio dignus sit</span>. We cannot judge from the events that befall a man what is the view which God takes of his character. We must not, like Job's friends, decide that a man is a great sinner because calamity falls upon him, nor again suppose that outward prosperity is a proof of a life righteous and well-pleasing to God. Outward circumstances are no criterion of inward disposition or of final judgment. From the troubles or the comforts which we ourselves experience or witness in others we have no right to argue God's favor or displeasure. He disposes matters as seems best to him, and we must not expect to see every one in this world treated according to what we should deem his deserts (comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a> with <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Delitzsch and others think that the expressions "love" and "hatred" are too general to admit of being interpreted as above, and they determine the sense to be that no one can tell beforehand who will be the objects of, his love or hate, or how entirely his feelings may change in regard of persons with whom he is brought in contact. The circumstances which give rise to these sentiments are entirely beyond his control and foresight. This is true enough, but it does not seem to me to be intended. The author is concerned, not with inward sentiments, but with prosperity and adversity considered popularly as indications of God's view of things. It would be but a meager assertion to state that you cannot know whether you are to love or hate, because God ordains all such contingencies; whereas to warn against hasty and infidel judgments on the ground of our ignorance of God's mysterious ways, is sound and weighty advice, and in due harmony with what follows in the next verses. The interpretation, "No man knows whether he shall meet with the love or hatred of his fellows," has commended itself to some critics, but is as inadmissible as the one just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">By all that is before them.</span> The Hebrew is simply, "all [lies] before them." All that shall happen, all that shall shape their destiny in the future, is obscure and unknown, and beyond their control.

The Vulgate mixes this clause with the following verse, <span class="accented">But all things are kept uncertain for the future</span>. St. Gregory, "As thou knowest not who are converted from sin to goodness, nor who turn back from goodness to sin; so also thou dost not understand what is doing towards thyself as thy merits deserve. And as thou dost not at all comprehend another's end, so art thou also unable to foresee thine own. For thou knowest now what progress thou hast made thyself, but what I [-God] still think of thee in secret thou knowest not. Thou now thinkest on thy deeds of righteousness; but thou knowest not how strictly they are weighed by me. Woe even to the praiseworthy life of men if it be judged without mercy, because when strictly examined it is overwhelmed in the presence of the Judge by the very conduct with which it imagines that it pleases him" ('Moral.,' 29:34, Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1444;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(lib&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
