In biblical times, the house was a central part of life, symbolizing stability and security. The trembling of the keepers suggests a loss of control and strength, reflecting the frailty that comes with old age. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of human mortality and the transient nature of life, as seen in <a href="/psalms/39-4.htm">Psalm 39:4-5</a>, which speaks of the brevity of human existence.<p><b>and the strong men stoop</b><br>The "strong men" likely refer to the legs or back, which lose their strength and cause a person to stoop or bend over as they age. This imagery highlights the decline of physical power and vitality, a common theme in wisdom literature that emphasizes the inevitability of aging and the importance of fearing God throughout one's life. The stooping of the strong men can also be seen as a humbling process, reminding believers of their dependence on God, as echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which encourages trust in the Lord rather than one's own understanding or strength.<p><b>when those grinding cease because they are few</b><br>This phrase is often interpreted as a reference to the teeth, which become fewer and less effective with age, leading to a cessation of grinding food. In ancient cultures, teeth were essential for sustenance and survival, and their loss symbolized a decline in one's ability to provide for oneself. This imagery serves as a reminder of the physical limitations that accompany aging and the need to rely on God's provision. The cessation of grinding also reflects the broader theme of life's impermanence, as seen in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which compares life to a mist that appears briefly and then vanishes.<p><b>and those watching through windows see dimly</b><br>The "watching through windows" is commonly understood as a metaphor for the eyes, which grow dim with age, impairing one's vision. In biblical times, clear vision was crucial for daily activities and maintaining awareness of one's surroundings. The dimming of sight symbolizes the gradual loss of perception and understanding that can accompany aging. This imagery aligns with the biblical emphasis on spiritual insight and the need for divine illumination, as expressed in <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>, which asks God to open one's eyes to see the wonders of His law. The dimming vision also serves as a metaphor for the fading clarity of life as one approaches the end of their earthly journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/keepers_of_the_house.htm">Keepers of the House</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the arms and hands, which protect and maintain the body, trembling with age.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/strong_men.htm">Strong Men</a></b><br>Represents the legs or the body's strength, which weakens and stoops with age.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_grinding.htm">Those Grinding</a></b><br>Refers to the teeth, which become fewer and cease to function effectively as one ages.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_watching_through_the_windows.htm">Those Watching Through the Windows</a></b><br>Symbolizes the eyes, which grow dim and lose clarity with age.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Metaphorically represents the human body, which deteriorates over time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_aging.htm">The Inevitability of Aging</a></b><br>Recognize that physical decline is a natural part of life, reminding us of our mortality and dependence on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_preparedness.htm">Spiritual Preparedness</a></b><br>As physical strength wanes, focus on spiritual growth and readiness for eternity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_wisdom.htm">Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>With age comes the opportunity for increased wisdom and understanding, which should be cherished and shared.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_beyond_physical_decline.htm">Hope Beyond Physical Decline</a></b><br>Embrace the hope of renewal and eternal life through faith in Christ, which transcends physical limitations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_support.htm">Community and Support</a></b><br>Encourage intergenerational relationships within the church to support and learn from one another.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_12_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 12:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_12_3_on_aging_s_frailty.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 12:3 illustrate the frailty of human life and aging?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_life_s_challenges.htm">What practical steps can we take to prepare for life's inevitable challenges?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Eccl_12_3_Ps_90_10_on_life_s_brevity.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 12:3 connect with Psalm 90:10 on life's brevity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_as_strength_fades.htm">In what ways can we honor God as our physical strength declines?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Value_abilities_Ecclesiastes_12_3.htm">How can Ecclesiastes 12:3 inspire us to value our current abilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_keepers_of_the_house_tremble.htm">What is the symbolic meaning of "the keepers of the house tremble" in Ecclesiastes 12:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_12_3_on_aging_and_mortality.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 12:3 reflect the theme of aging and mortality?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Ecclesiastes_12_3.htm">What historical context influenced the imagery used in Ecclesiastes 12:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ecclesiastes_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ecclesiastes 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_is_qoheleth_in_ecclesiastes.htm">Who is Qoheleth in the Book of Ecclesiastes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_is_the_preacher_in_ecclesiastes.htm">Who is the Preacher in Ecclesiastes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_eccl._9_2_align_with_divine_justice.htm">In Ecclesiastes 9:2, how can both righteous and wicked sharing the same fate align with other passages promising divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'bind_the_strongman'_mean.htm">What does 'bind the strongman' mean?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Ecclesiastes 12:3 Mean</div><b>the keepers of the house tremble</b><p>&#8220;on the day the keepers of the house tremble&#8230;&#8221;

The shaking and palsy of old men's limbs are thus graphically described. This would be one of the first symptoms discerned by an observer. Taking the alternative interpretation, we should see in these "keepers" the menservants who keep watch before the house. These menials are appalled by the approach of the tempest, and quake. <span class="cmt_word">And the strong men shall bow themselves.</span> The "men of power" are the legs, or the bones generally, which in the young are "as pillars of marble" (<a href="/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>), but in the old become feeble, slack, and bent. Delitzsch quotes 3Macc. 4:5, where we read of a multitude of old men being driven mercilessly, "stooping from age, and dragging their feet heavily along." In this clause it is this stooping and bending of the body that is noticed, when men are no longer upright in stature, "swifter than eagles," "stronger than lions" (<a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), fit for war and active employment. It is therefore less appropriate to see in the "keepers" the legs, and in the "strong men" the arms. Otherwise, the latter are the masters, the wealthy and noble, in contradistinction to the menials before mentioned: both lords and servants are equally terrified at the approach of the tempest, or, as Wright would say, at the touch of the sickly season (see on ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">And the grinders cease because they are few</span>. The word for "grinders" is feminine (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the grinding-women," Septuagint), doubtless because grinding was especially women's business (<a href="/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>). By them are meant the teeth, as we speak of <span class="accented">molars</span>, though, of course, the term here applies to all the teeth; so the Greeks used the term <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for the <span class="accented">denies molares</span>. These, becoming few in number and no longer continuous, cannot perform their office. Otherwise, the grinding-women leave their work or pause in their labors at the approach of the storm, though one does not quite see why they should be fewer than usual, unless the sickly season has prostrated most of their companions, or that many are too frightened to ply their task. Having, therefore, harder work than usual, they stop at times to recruit themselves. But the analogy rather breaks down here; one would be inclined to suppose that their decreased numbers would make them apply themselves more assiduously to their necessary occupation. As the "keepers" in the former part of the verse were slaves, so these grinders are slaves, such occupation being the lowest form of service (see <a href="/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>; <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href="/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Those that look out of the windows be darkened.</span> These are the eyes that look forth from the cavities in which they are sunk; they are regarded as the windows of the bodily structure, the eyelashes or eyelids possibly being deemed the lattice of the same. Plumptre cites Cicero, ' De Nat. Deer.,' 2:140: "Sensus interpretes ac nuntii return, in capite, tamquam in arce, mirifice ad usus necessaries et facti et collocati sunt. Nam oculi, tamquam speculatores, altissimum locum obtinent; ex quo plurima conspicientes, fungantur sue munere." The dimness in the eye and the failing in the powers of sight are well expressed by the terms of the text. It is noted of Moses, as something altogether abnormal, that at a hundred and twenty years of age "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>). Taking the alternative interpretation, we must regard those that look out of the windows as the ladies of the house, who have no menial work to do, and employ their time in gazing idly from the lattices (comp. <a href="/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>). These "are darkened," they are terror-stricken, their faces gather blackness (<a href="/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>), or they retire into corners in terror of the storm. These women are parallel to "the strong men" mentioned above; so that the weather affects all of every class - men-servants and maidservants, lords and ladies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">on the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
