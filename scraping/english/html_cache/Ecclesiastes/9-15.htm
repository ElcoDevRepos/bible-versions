In biblical times, wisdom was often associated with wealth and status, as seen in figures like Solomon. However, this man's poverty highlights the theme of Ecclesiastes that earthly status does not equate to true value or wisdom. The city, likely a small fortified town, represents a community in need, emphasizing the man's significance despite his lowly status. This reflects the biblical principle that God often uses the humble and lowly to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>and he saved the city by his wisdom</b><br>The man's wisdom, not his wealth or power, is the means of salvation for the city. This echoes the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God and can lead to deliverance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6-7</a>. The deliverance of the city can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though humble and rejected, brings salvation through divine wisdom. This also connects to the story of Joseph, who saved Egypt through God-given wisdom despite his initial low status.<p><b>Yet no one remembered that poor man</b><br>This phrase underscores the fleeting nature of human gratitude and recognition. Despite his significant contribution, the man's poverty leads to his being forgotten, illustrating the vanity and temporality of human accolades, a central theme in Ecclesiastes. This forgetfulness can be compared to the rejection and forgetfulness of Christ by many, despite His ultimate sacrifice and wisdom. It also serves as a reminder of the biblical teaching that our reward is not in earthly recognition but in eternal life with God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor_wise_man.htm">The Poor Wise Man</a></b><br>A central figure in this verse, representing wisdom and humility.

Therefore, pursue the wisdom that comes from above, serve faithfully even when unseen, and anchor your hope in the Lord who never forgets His faithful ones (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Now there was found in it a poor wise man.</span> The verb, regarded as impersonal, may be thus taken. Or we may continue the subject of the preceding verse and consider the king as spoken of: "He came across, met with unexpectedly, a poor man who was wise." So the Septuagint. The word for <span class="accented">"poor"</span> in this passage is <span class="accented">misken</span>, for which see note on Ecclesiastes 4:13. <span class="cmt_word">He by his wisdom delivered the city</span>. When the besieged city had neither soldiers nor arms to defend itself against its mighty enemies, the man of poor estate, hitherto unknown or little regarded, came forward, and by wise counsel relieved his countrymen from their perilous situation. How this was done we are left to conjecture. It may have been by some timely concessions or negotiations; or by the surrender of a chief offender as at Abel-Beth-maachah; or by the assassination of a general, as at Bethulia (Jud. 13:8); or by the clever application of mechanical arts, as at Syracuse, under the direction of Archimedes (Livy, 24:34; Plutarch, 'Marcell.,' 15-18.). Yet no man remembered that same poor man. As soon as the exigence which brought him forward was past, the poor man fell back into his insignificance, and was thought of no more; he gained no personal advantage, by his wisdom; his ungrateful countrymen forgot his very existence. Thus Joseph was treated by the chief butler (<a href="/genesis/40-23.htm">Genesis 40:23</a>). Classical readers will think of Coriolanus, Scipio Africanus, Themistocles, Miltiades, who for their services to the state were rewarded with calumny, false accusation, obloquy, and banishment. The author of the Book of Wisdom gives a different and ideal experience. "I," he says, "for the sake of wisdom shall have estimation among the multitude, and honor with the elders, though I be young.... By the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial" (Wisd. 8:10-13). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mis&#183;k&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4542.htm">Strong's 4542: </a> </span><span class="str2">Indigent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was found</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
