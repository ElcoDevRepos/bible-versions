The stillborn child symbolizes the ultimate expression of life's fleeting nature. In biblical times, a stillborn child was seen as a profound tragedy, reflecting the unpredictability and often harsh realities of life. The use of "futility" connects to the Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "vanity" or "meaninglessness," which appears frequently throughout Ecclesiastes. This word suggests a vapor or breath, emphasizing the transient and elusive nature of human endeavors. The comparison to a stillborn child underscores the preacher's view that life, without understanding or purpose, can seem as futile as a life that never fully begins.<p><b>and departs in darkness</b><br>The imagery of darkness here conveys a sense of obscurity and the unknown. In the ancient Near Eastern context, darkness often symbolized death, ignorance, or the absence of God's presence. The stillborn child, having never seen the light of day, departs in darkness, which can be interpreted as a metaphor for the lack of fulfillment or understanding in life. This reflects the broader existential questions posed in Ecclesiastes about the meaning of life and the inevitability of death. The darkness also contrasts with the biblical theme of light as life and truth, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, where light represents the life and revelation brought by Christ.<p><b>and his name is shrouded in obscurity</b><br>In biblical culture, a name held significant importance, often reflecting one's identity, character, or destiny. The absence of a name for the stillborn child signifies a lack of identity and remembrance, emphasizing the theme of obscurity. This can be seen as a commentary on the human desire for legacy and remembrance, which Ecclesiastes suggests is ultimately futile. The obscurity of the name parallels the preacher's observations about the fleeting nature of fame and human achievement. In contrast, the Bible often highlights the eternal significance of names written in the Book of Life, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>, where believers are promised that their names will never be blotted out. This contrast underscores the transient nature of earthly recognition compared to the eternal recognition by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.
