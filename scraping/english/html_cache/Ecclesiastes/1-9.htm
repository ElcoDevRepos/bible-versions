The author, traditionally identified as Solomon, observes that human endeavors and events tend to repeat themselves. This concept is rooted in the understanding of a fallen world where human nature remains consistent over time. Theologically, it underscores the idea of a world subjected to futility due to sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-21</a>. The repetitive nature of history can be seen in the rise and fall of empires, the recurring patterns of human behavior, and the ongoing struggle with sin and redemption.<p><b>and what has been done will be done again</b><br>This continuation emphasizes the repetitive actions and achievements of humanity. Despite technological advancements and cultural changes, the fundamental activities and pursuits of people remain unchanged. This can be seen in the continuous quest for power, wealth, and knowledge throughout history. The phrase suggests a sense of weariness and futility, echoing the sentiments found in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where labor and toil are part of the human condition post-Fall. It also points to the limitations of human innovation and the inability to achieve ultimate fulfillment through earthly means.<p><b>there is nothing new under the sun</b><br>This concluding statement reinforces the idea that all human endeavors are ultimately transient and repetitive. The phrase "under the sun" is a key theme in Ecclesiastes, signifying life from a purely earthly perspective, devoid of eternal significance. It highlights the limitations of human wisdom and achievement when disconnected from divine purpose. This perspective is contrasted with the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who offers newness of life (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>) and a hope that transcends earthly existence. The phrase challenges readers to seek meaning beyond the temporal and to find purpose in the eternal truths of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Justin Martyr (<span class= "ital">Apol. i.</span> 57) has what looks like a reminiscence of this verse; but we cannot rely on it to prove his acquaintance with the book, the same idea being found in Grecian philosophy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate render the first clauses of the two parts of the verse in both cases interrogatively, thus: "What is that which hath been? The very thing which shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very thing which shall be done." What has been affirmed of phenomena in the material world is now affirmed of the events of man's life. They move in an analogous circle, whether they are concerned with actions or morals. Plumptre sees here an anticipation or a reproduction of the Stoic doctrine of a recurring cycle of events, such as Viral mentions in his fourth 'Eclogue' - <p><span class="foreign">"Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo," etc.</span> But Koheleth is speaking merely from experience, and is indulging in no philosophical speculations. There is <span class="cmt_word">no new thing under the sun</span>. The Vulgate transfers this clause to the next verso, which, indeed, supports the assertion. From classical authors commentators have culled examples of the same thought. Thus Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 3:55, "Nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis, ut quem ad modum temporum vices, ita morum vertantur." Seneca, 'Epist.,' 24, "Nullius rei finis est, sod in orbem nexa sunt omnia; fugiunt ac sequuntur Omnia transeunt ut revertantur, nihil novi video, nihil novi facio. Fit ali-quando et hujus rei nausea." M. Aurelius, 'Medit.,' 6:37, "He that sees the present has seen all things, both that which has Been from everlasting and that which shall Be in the future. All things are of one birth and one form." Again, 7:1, "There is nothing new; all things are common and quickly over;" 12:26, "Everything that comes to pass was always so coming to pass, and will take place again." Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 1:57, has, perhaps, a reminiscence of this passage when he writes, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has been</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative &#124;
