In the context of Ecclesiastes, "under the sun" refers to life on earth, emphasizing the human perspective apart from divine revelation. The author, traditionally believed to be Solomon, uses this phrase to highlight the futility and vanity of earthly pursuits. This aligns with the broader theme of Ecclesiastes, which questions the value of worldly achievements without a relationship with God. The term "grievous" suggests a deep sorrow or burden, indicating the severity of the issue being addressed.<p><b>wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner:</b><br>The act of hoarding wealth is depicted as harmful, suggesting that excessive accumulation can lead to negative consequences. This reflects the biblical principle that wealth, when not used wisely or shared, can become a source of personal destruction. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet the misuse of it could lead to spiritual and relational decay. This idea is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against storing up treasures on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The harm mentioned could be both physical and spiritual, as the obsession with wealth can lead to anxiety, isolation, and a false sense of security. The passage serves as a caution against the idolatry of wealth, urging believers to seek contentment and generosity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation where Solomon reigned, representing a place of both spiritual significance and material prosperity during his time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_owner.htm">The Owner</a></b><br>- The individual who hoards wealth, experiencing harm as a result of their actions, illustrating a universal human tendency.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>- A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to denote life on earth, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth.htm">Wealth</a></b><br>- Material riches that, when hoarded, can lead to negative consequences for the individual, as observed by Solomon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hoarding_wealth.htm">The Danger of Hoarding Wealth</a></b><br>Hoarding wealth can lead to spiritual and emotional harm, as it often becomes an idol that distracts from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_riches.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Riches</a></b><br>Wealth is fleeting and cannot provide lasting satisfaction or security, reminding us to focus on eternal values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_a_remedy.htm">Generosity as a Remedy</a></b><br>Practicing generosity can counteract the negative effects of hoarding, aligning our hearts with God's purposes and blessing others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_god's_provision.htm">Contentment in God's Provision</a></b><br>Finding contentment in what God provides helps us avoid the trap of accumulating wealth for its own sake.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>We are called to be good stewards of the resources God entrusts to us, using them to further His kingdom rather than for selfish gain.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_5_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prevent_wealth_hoarding.htm">How can we avoid the "grievous evil" of hoarding wealth in Ecclesiastes 5:13?
