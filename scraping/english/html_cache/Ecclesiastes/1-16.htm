It suggests a deep, personal contemplation, often seen in the writings of Solomon, who is traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes. This internal dialogue sets the stage for the exploration of wisdom and its limitations.<p><b>Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom</b><br>The speaker claims a significant accumulation of wisdom, which aligns with the biblical portrayal of Solomon, who was renowned for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This wisdom was a divine gift, as Solomon famously asked God for an understanding heart to govern the people (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of human pursuit of wisdom and the recognition of its ultimate insufficiency without divine perspective.<p><b>beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem</b><br>This reference to predecessors in Jerusalem suggests a historical context, likely pointing to the kings who ruled before Solomon. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Israel, was significant in biblical history. The claim of surpassing previous rulers in wisdom highlights the unique position of the speaker, traditionally Solomon, whose wisdom was unparalleled in his time.<p><b>and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge</b><br>The observation of wisdom and knowledge indicates an empirical approach, where the speaker has actively engaged with and studied the world. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The accumulation of knowledge is portrayed as vast, yet Ecclesiastes ultimately questions the value of wisdom without a relationship with God, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation of Christ as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his unparalleled wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.

Who are the rulers alluded to? Solomon himself was only the second of the Israelite kings who reigned there; of the Canaanite princes who may have made that their capital, we have no knowledge, nor is R likely that Solomon would compare himself with them. The Targum has altered the approved reading, and gives, "Above all the wise men that were in Jerusalem before me." The reading, "in [instead of 'over'] Jerusalem," has indeed some manuscript authority, and is confirmed by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac, but it is evidently a correction of the text by critics who saw the difficulty of the authorized wording. Motais and others assert that the preposition in the Masoretic text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">all</span>, often means "in," as well as "over," when the reference is to an elevated spot; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. But even granting this, we are still uncertain who are the persons meant. Commentators point to Melchizedek, Adonizedek, and Araunah among rulers, and to Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda (<a href="/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>) among sages. But we know nothing of the wisdom of the former, and there is no tangible reason why the latter should be designated "before me in Jerusalem." Doubtless the words point to a succession of kings who had reigned in Jerusalem, and the writer, involuntarily, perhaps, betrays his assumed character, in relying an excusable anachronism, while giving to the personated monarch a position which could not belong to the historical Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, my heart had great experience of</span> (<span class="accented">hath seen abundantly</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;</span> Venetian) <span class="cmt_word">wisdom and knowledge</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> used adverbially qualifies the word before it, "hath seen." The heart, as we have observed (ver. 13), is considered the seat of the intellectual life. In saying that the heart hath seen wisdom, the writer means that his mind has taken it in, apprehended and appropriated it (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>; <a href="/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>). <span class="accented">Wisdom and knowledge</span>;
