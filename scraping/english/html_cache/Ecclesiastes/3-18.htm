It suggests a deep, contemplative thought process, common in wisdom literature, where the writer seeks to understand life's complexities. This internal dialogue is a hallmark of Ecclesiastes, where the author often wrestles with existential questions.<p><b>As for the sons of men</b><br>This term refers to humanity in general, emphasizing the universal nature of the observation. In biblical context, "sons of men" often highlights human frailty and mortality, contrasting with the divine nature of God. It underscores the shared human experience and the limitations inherent in being human.<p><b>God tests them</b><br>The concept of God testing humanity is prevalent throughout Scripture. In the Old Testament, testing often serves to reveal character and faithfulness, as seen in the stories of Abraham (Genesis 22) and Job. This testing is not for God's knowledge, as He is omniscient, but for humans to understand their own nature and dependence on God.<p><b>so that they may see for themselves</b><br>This phrase suggests a purpose behind the testing: self-awareness and realization. It implies that through trials and challenges, individuals gain insight into their true nature and limitations. This aligns with the biblical theme of self-examination and repentance, encouraging believers to recognize their need for God.<p><b>that they are but beasts</b><br>This comparison to beasts highlights the mortality and base instincts shared between humans and animals. It serves as a humbling reminder of human limitations and the inevitability of death, a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes. This perspective is echoed in <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a>, which states that despite human pride, without understanding, people are like the beasts that perish.

We see the effect of this forbearance on the wicked in <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; it hardens them in impenitence; while it nourishes the faith of the righteous, and helps them to persevere (see <a href="/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span> The pronoun is repeated emphatically, "that they themselves are [like] beasts, they in themselves."
