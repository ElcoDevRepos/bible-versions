The expression "under the sun" is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, symbolizing life in the earthly realm, often with a focus on its temporal and sometimes futile nature. This phrase sets the stage for a reflection on human behavior and societal dynamics, suggesting a commonality in human experience. The phrase "under the sun" is used throughout Ecclesiastes to highlight the limitations of human understanding and the repetitive cycles of life, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, which states, "What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun."<p><b>followed this second one</b><br>The "second one" refers to a successor, likely a younger individual who rises to power or prominence. This reflects the transient nature of leadership and the inevitable change in authority. The idea of following a new leader can be seen throughout biblical history, such as the transition from Saul to David in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, where David, though initially a shepherd boy, is anointed as the future king of Israel. This phrase may also imply the fickle nature of public opinion and the tendency of people to shift their allegiance to new leaders, often driven by the hope of better circumstances or change.<p><b>the youth who succeeded the king</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the theme of succession and the rise of a younger generation. In the historical context of ancient Israel and surrounding nations, it was common for younger individuals to ascend to positions of power, sometimes through unexpected means. The mention of "youth" suggests vigor, potential, and the promise of new beginnings, but also inexperience and the challenges that come with leadership. This can be compared to the story of Solomon himself, who became king at a young age and initially sought wisdom from God to govern his people effectively, as recorded in <a href="/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7-9</a>. The phrase underscores the cyclical nature of leadership and the inevitability of generational change, a theme that resonates throughout the book of Ecclesiastes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally identified as King Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who reflects on the meaning of life and human endeavors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents established authority and leadership, possibly an older ruler who is succeeded.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_youth.htm">The Youth</a></b><br>A young successor who rises to power, symbolizing change and the transient nature of human leadership.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to denote life on earth, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers.htm">Followers</a></b><br>The people who shift their allegiance from the old king to the new youth, illustrating the fickle nature of public opinion and support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_human_leadership.htm">The Transience of Human Leadership</a></b><br>Earthly power and authority are temporary.

Such popularity is fickle: the same voices that hailed Jesus with &#8220;Hosanna&#8221; later cried &#8220;Crucify Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon hints that chasing public favor is vanity;

<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>), reminding us that every earthly succession points to the ultimate, unchanging reign of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon records that everyone &#8220;under the sun&#8221;

It seems to me that by no stretch of rhetoric can "all the living which walk under the sun" be taken for the subjects of the sovereign in question. I am inclined to think that the Preacher reverts to the general topic, and considered all the living with the "second youth," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the second generation which shall succeed them. He saw the old generation hardened in its ways, and incapable of being admonished, and then displaced by a new generation, with which the next will feel equal dissatisfaction.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I considered all the living which walk under the sun</span>; or, <span class="accented">I have seen</span> all the population.
