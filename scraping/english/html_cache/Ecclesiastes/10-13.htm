In biblical context, folly often denotes a moral and spiritual deficiency rather than mere intellectual failure. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." This suggests that the fool's talk lacks the foundation of reverence for God, leading to misguided and unwise speech. Historically, the culture of ancient Israel placed high value on wisdom, often associating it with righteousness and divine favor. The fool's folly, therefore, is not just a personal failing but a deviation from the community's spiritual and moral standards.<p><b>and the end of his speech is evil madness</b><br>The conclusion of the fool's speech is described as "evil madness," indicating a progression from mere folly to something more destructive and chaotic. This escalation reflects the biblical principle that sin and foolishness, when unchecked, lead to greater corruption and disorder. <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a> warns of the tongue's potential to corrupt the whole body and set the course of one's life on fire. The term "madness" in this context suggests a loss of rationality and control, aligning with the biblical portrayal of sin as leading to spiritual and moral disintegration. The phrase also echoes the broader theme in Ecclesiastes of the futility and vanity of life apart from God, as the fool's speech ultimately results in harm and chaos rather than constructive or godly outcomes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

A confirmation of the last clause of the preceding verse. The fool speaks according to his nature.

But he does not stop there. <span class="cmt_word">The end of his talk is mischievous madness.</span> By the time he has finished, he has committed himself to statements that are worse than silly, that are presumptuous, frenzied, indicative of mental and moral depravity. Intemperate language about the secrets of God's providence and the moral government of the world may be intended. Some think that the writer is still alluding to dangerous talk concerning a tyrannical ruler, seditious proposals, secret conspiracies, etc. The text itself does not confirm such notion with any certainty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The beginning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7717;il&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8462.htm">Strong's 8462: </a> </span><span class="str2">A commencement, rel, original</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his talk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is folly,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(si&#7733;&#183;l&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5531.htm">Strong's 5531: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silliness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_319.htm">Strong's 319: </a> </span><span class="str2">The last, end, the future, posterity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his speech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is evil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">madness.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1500;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#234;&#183;l&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1948.htm">Strong's 1948: </a> </span><span class="str2">Madness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 10:13 The beginning of the words of his (Ecclesiast.
