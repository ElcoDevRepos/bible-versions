It suggests a viewpoint limited to the material world, often highlighting the futility and vanity of human endeavors without divine perspective. The "evil" mentioned here refers to a moral or ethical wrong, something that disrupts the natural order or justice. This aligns with the broader theme of Ecclesiastes, which often reflects on the apparent injustices and absurdities of life.<p><b>an error that proceeds from the ruler:</b><br>The "error" indicates a mistake or misjudgment, particularly in leadership. In ancient Israel and surrounding cultures, rulers were expected to uphold justice and wisdom. When a ruler errs, it can have widespread consequences, affecting the entire nation. This reflects the biblical principle that leadership carries significant responsibility and accountability (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>). The mention of a ruler connects to the broader biblical narrative of kingship, where leaders like David and Solomon are both celebrated and critiqued for their governance. It also foreshadows the perfect rule of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King, who embodies wisdom and justice (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The evil which he noticed appeared to be (he does not affirm that it is) a mistake caused by the ruler; it so presented itself to his mind. The caution observed in the statement may be owing partly to the tacit feeling that such blots occasioned difficulties in the view taken of the moral government of the world. He does not intend to refer to God under the appellation "Ruler." The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "As if it came involuntarily;" Vulgate, to much the same effect, <span class="accented">Quasi per errorem egrediens</span>. The idea here is either gnat the evil is one not produced by any intentional action of the ruler, but resulting from human imperfection, or that what appears to be a mistake is not so really. But these interpretations are unsuitable. Those who adhere to the Solomonic authorship of our book see here a prophetic intimation of the evil of Jeroboam's rule, which evil proceeded from the sins of Solomon himself and his son Rehoboam.
