The term "futile" underscores the theme of vanity and the fleeting nature of human endeavors, a recurring motif throughout Ecclesiastes. This perspective aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the temporary nature of earthly life compared to eternal realities (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>).<p><b>I have seen both of these:</b><br>The phrase introduces a personal observation, suggesting that the insights shared are based on real-life experiences. This approach is consistent with the wisdom literature style, which often draws from practical life observations to convey deeper truths. The use of "both of these" sets up a contrast between two seemingly contradictory outcomes.<p><b>A righteous man perishing in his righteousness,</b><br>This observation challenges the common expectation that righteousness leads to prosperity and long life, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>. The righteous man's untimely death despite his righteousness raises questions about divine justice and the apparent randomness of life events. This paradox is echoed in the experiences of Job, who suffered despite his righteousness, and foreshadows the ultimate righteous sufferer, Jesus Christ, who perished despite His perfect righteousness.<p><b>and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</b><br>The longevity of the wicked, despite their immoral behavior, further complicates the understanding of divine justice. This scenario is addressed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist grapples with the prosperity of the wicked. The long life of the wicked serves as a test of faith for believers, reminding them that ultimate justice is in God's hands and may not be fully realized in this life. This tension points to the eschatological hope of final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom, where true justice will prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Ecclesiastes begins and ends with the refrain &#8220;Vanity of vanities&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; 12:8), and here he personalizes that theme&#8212;&#8220;my futile life.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This honesty invites us to look squarely at the brevity of our days, echoing <a href="/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5</a>, &#8220;Surely every man at his best is a vapor.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet Scripture never leaves us in despair; <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> reminds that the mist of life drives us to humble dependence on God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have seen both of these</b><p>Solomon is not theorizing; he is recording real observation. Wisdom literature often begins with what the eye sees, then leads us to what faith believes (compare <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>).<p>&#8226; By admitting what seems contradictory, Solomon prepares us for God&#8217;s deeper answer&#8212;just as Asaph wrestled out loud in <a href="/bsb/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>: &#8220;I saw the prosperity of the wicked&#8230; surely in vain I kept my heart pure.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Authentic faith does not ignore hard evidence; it brings confusion to the Lord instead of hiding it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A righteous man perishing in his righteousness</b><p>Here is the perplexity: sometimes the one who loves God and lives uprightly still dies early or suffers greatly.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s story (<a href="/bsb/job/1.htm">Job 1&#8211;2</a>; 42) shows that righteousness does not guarantee ease; it does guarantee God&#8217;s sustaining presence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35-38</a> lists faithful saints who &#8220;were put to death with the sword,&#8221; yet the chapter calls them victorious.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a> offers comfort: &#8220;The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart&#8230; but they are spared from evil.&#8221; Temporal loss can be divine mercy, ushering believers into eternal joy (<a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The cross itself displays this mystery: the only truly righteous Man perished, yet in doing so secured resurrection life for all who believe (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a wicked man living long in his wickedness</b><p>Just as troubling is the villain who seems to evade consequence.

Earthly longevity is not blessing if it only lengthens rebellion; judgment is certain (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience toward the wicked reflects His desire that they repent (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), but His justice will not fail (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a> names a reality every believer notices sooner or later: life does not always sort people into tidy categories of reward and punishment on our timetable. The righteous may suffer; the wicked may thrive&#8212;temporarily. Solomon&#8217;s candid observation drives us to trust God beyond what we can see. Eternal perspective reveals that righteousness is never wasted and wickedness never truly succeeds. Our calling is to walk faithfully, leave outcomes to the Judge of all the earth (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>), and rest in Christ, who redeems every apparent contradiction for His glory and our good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Days of my vanity.--</span><a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm" title="For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - Section 3. <span class="accented">Warnings against excesses</span>, <span class="accented">and praise of the golden mean</span>, which is practical wisdom and the art of living happily. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things have I seen in the days of my vanity</span>. Koheleth gives his own experience of an anomalous condition which often obtains in human affairs. "All," being here defined by the article, must refer to the cases which he has mentioned or proceeds to mention. "The days of vanity" mean merely "fleeting, vain days" (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>). The expression denotes the writer's view of the emptiness and transitoriness of life (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>), and it may also have special reference to his own vain efforts to solve the problems of existence. <span class="cmt_word">There is a just</span> (<span class="accented">righteous</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man that perisheth in his righteousness</span>. Here is a difficulty about the dispensation of good and evil, which has always perplexed the thoughtful. It finds expression in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, though the singer propounds a solution (ver. 17) which Koheleth misses. The meaning of the preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) before "righteousness" is disputed. Delitzsch, Wright, and others take it as equivalent to "in spite of," as in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>, where "in this thing" means "notwithstanding," "for all this thing." Righteousness has the promise of long life and prosperity; it is an anomaly that it should meet with disaster and early death. We cannot argue from this that the author did not believe in temporal rewards and punishments; he states merely certain of his own experiences, which may be abnormal and capable of explanation. For his special purpose this was sufficient. Others take the preposition to mean "through," "in consequence of." Good men have always been persecuted for righteousness' sake (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), and so far the interpretation is quite admissible, and is perhaps supported by ver. 16, which makes a certain sort of righteousness the cause of disaster. But looking to the second clause of the present verse, where we can hardly suppose that the wicked man is said to attain to long life in consequence of his wickedness, we are safe in adopting the rendering, "in spite of." <span class="cmt_word">There is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in</span> (<span class="accented">in spite of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his wickedness</span>. The verb <span class="accented">arak</span>, "to make long," "to prolong," is used both with and without the accusative "days" (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12, 13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>).

According to the moral government of God experienced by the Hebrews in their history, the sinner was to suffer calamity and to be cut off prematurely. This is the contention of Job's friends, against which he argues so warmly. The writer of the Book of Wisdom has learned to look for the correction of such anomalies in another life. He sees that length of days is not always a blessing, and that retribution awaits the evil beyond the grave (Wisd. 1:9 Wisd. 3:4, 10 Wisd. 4:8, 19, etc.). Abel perished in early youth; Cain had his days prolonged.
