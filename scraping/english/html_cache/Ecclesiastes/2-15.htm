The author, traditionally understood to be Solomon, is engaging in a personal dialogue. This introspective approach is common in wisdom literature, where the writer often contemplates life's deeper meanings and personal experiences.<p><b>The fate of the fool will also befall me</b><br>Here, the "fate" refers to death, a universal experience that does not discriminate between the wise and the foolish. This reflects the biblical theme of the vanity of earthly pursuits, as seen in <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>, which notes that both the wise and the foolish perish. The inevitability of death underscores the limitations of human wisdom and achievement.<p><b>What then have I gained by being wise?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the perceived futility of wisdom when faced with the inevitability of death. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, wisdom was highly valued, yet here it is questioned. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>, where human wisdom is contrasted with the wisdom of God, suggesting that earthly wisdom alone is insufficient for true fulfillment.<p><b>And I said to myself that this too is futile</b><br>The conclusion of futility or vanity is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes. The Hebrew word "hevel," often translated as "futile" or "vanity," suggests something transient or elusive. This reflects the broader biblical narrative that true meaning and purpose are found not in earthly wisdom or achievements but in a relationship with God, as seen in the ultimate fulfillment through Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life beyond the temporal concerns of this world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>Represents those who live without wisdom or understanding, often making poor choices and lacking foresight.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise.htm">The Wise</a></b><br>In contrast to the fool, the wise person seeks understanding, knowledge, and lives according to God's principles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place of Solomon's reign and the location where he would have reflected on life's meaning and purpose.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit_of_wisdom.htm">The Pursuit of Wisdom</a></b><br>An event or theme throughout Ecclesiastes where Solomon explores the value and limitations of human wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>Solomon acknowledges that despite his wisdom, he faces the same fate as the fool.

Like the psalmist who asks, &#8220;Why, my soul, are you downcast?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/42-5.htm">Psalm 42:5</a>), Solomon turns inward to test the value of everything he has tried &#8220;under the sun&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly commends such examination: &#8220;Let us examine our ways and test them&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40</a>), because self-reflection before God leads either to repentance or renewed faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The fate of the fool will also befall me.&#8221;</b><p>- The &#8220;fate&#8221; in view is physical death. Whether wise or foolish, every person returns to dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19-20</a>).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> reminds us, &#8220;people are appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p>- By placing the wise and the fool on the same mortal path, Solomon strips away any illusion that brilliance can shield from the grave.<p>- This does not deny the moral difference between wisdom and folly (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>); it simply notes their shared endpoint in a fallen world.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What then have I gained by being wise?&#8221;</b><p>- The question exposes the limits of earthly wisdom:<p>&#8226; It can lengthen life (<a href="/proverbs/9-11.htm">Proverbs 9:11</a>) but cannot cancel death.<p>&#8226; It can bring honor (<a href="/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>) yet cannot secure eternal reward.<p>&#8226; It can guide good decisions (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>) but cannot erase sin.<p>- Paul echoes the sentiment when he asks, &#8220;Where is the wise? &#8230; Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>- Without a view beyond the sun, wisdom&#8217;s returns look short-lived. This drives the reader to seek greater revelation&#8212;&#8220;Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And I said to myself that this too is futile.&#8221;</b><p>- &#8220;Futile&#8221; (or &#8220;vanity&#8221;) describes what is fleeting, insubstantial, and unsatisfying. Creation itself &#8220;was subjected to futility&#8221; after the fall (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>).<p>- Solomon is not despising God-given wisdom; he is lamenting the curse that blankets human experience. Even the best gifts seem empty when death ultimately claims them.<p>- The cry anticipates the gospel promise: &#8220;The creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>). Only resurrection hope answers the futility Solomon observes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p>Solomon&#8217;s inner dialogue in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a> confronts us with a sobering truth: earthly wisdom, though priceless for daily living, cannot outlast the grave. The wise and the fool share the same mortal fate, making every achievement &#8220;under the sun&#8221; feel hollow. Scripture agrees&#8212;death reigns because of sin&#8212;but it also points beyond the despair. Christ, the true Wisdom, defeats death and fills life with lasting purpose. Until His return, even our greatest insights will seem fleeting, yet they steer us to the One who makes nothing vain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>said I in my heart</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>), <span class="cmt_word">As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me.</span> He applies the general statement of ver. 14 to his own case.

He puts the question - To what end, with what design, has he been so excessively wise, or, as it may be, wise overmuch (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a>)? His wisdom has, as it were, recoiled upon himself - it taught him much, but not content; it made him keen-sighted in seeing the emptiness of human things, but it satisfied not his cravings. <span class="cmt_word">Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> This similarity of fate for philosopher and fool makes life vain and worthless; or rather, the meaning may be, if the superiority of wisdom over folly conduces to no other end than this, that superiority is a vanity. The LXX. has glossed the passage, followed herein by the Syriac, "Moreover, I spake in my heart that indeed this is also vanity, because the fool speaks out of his abundance" - ver. 16 giving the substance of the fool's thoughts. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Locutusque cum mente mea</span>, <span class="accented">animadverti quod hoc quoque esset vanitas</span>.
