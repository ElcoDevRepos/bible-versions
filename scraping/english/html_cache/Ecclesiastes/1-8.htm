The Hebrew word translated as "wearisome" can also mean "full of labor" or "toilsome," indicating the burdensome nature of life. This sentiment echoes the curse of labor given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where toil and weariness became part of the human condition due to sin. The phrase suggests that human efforts, no matter how extensive, ultimately lead to exhaustion and dissatisfaction. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that true rest and fulfillment are found only in God (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>the eye is not satisfied with seeing,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the insatiable nature of human desires. The eye, representing human curiosity and desire for new experiences, is never fully content. This can be connected to the story of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>, where the desire to see and know more led to the fall. The perpetual longing for more is a reflection of the human heart's search for meaning and purpose, which can only be truly satisfied in a relationship with God (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The dissatisfaction of the eye also points to the transient nature of worldly pleasures and the need for eternal perspective.<p><b>nor the ear content with hearing.</b><br>Similar to the eye, the ear symbolizes the human quest for knowledge and understanding. The ear's inability to be content suggests that no amount of information or wisdom can fully satisfy the human soul. This is reminiscent of the pursuit of wisdom by Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who despite his vast knowledge, found it ultimately unfulfilling (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). The phrase underscores the limitations of human wisdom and the necessity of divine revelation for true understanding (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, the Word made flesh, who provides the ultimate truth and satisfaction (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The central place of worship and the setting for much of Solomon's life and reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>- The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who reflects on the meaning and purpose of life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>- The cultural and historical context in which Ecclesiastes was written, providing insight into the worldview and spiritual struggles of the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_human_experience.htm">The Human Experience</a></b><br>- The universal theme of seeking satisfaction and meaning, which transcends time and culture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_human_dissatisfaction.htm">The Nature of Human Dissatisfaction</a></b><br>The verse highlights the insatiable nature of human desires.

Taking the word <span class="accented">dabar</span> in the sense of "ward" (compare the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), the LXX. translates, "All words are wearisome;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to go through the whole catalogue of such things as those mentioned in the preceding verses would be a laborious and unprofitable task. The Targum and many modern expositors approve this rendering. But besides that, the word <span class="accented">yaged</span> implies suffering, not causing, weariness (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; <a href="/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>); the run of the sentence is unnecessarily interrupted by such an assertion, when one is expecting a conclusion from the instances given above. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">cunetse res difficiles</span>. The idea, as Motais has seen, is this - Man's life is constrained by the same law as his surroundings; he goes on his course subject to influences which he cannot control; in spite of his efforts, he can never be independent. This conclusion is developed in succeeding verses. In the present verse the proposition with which it starts is explained by what follows. All things have been the object of much labor; men have elaborately examined everything; yet the result is most unsatisfactory, the end is not reached; words cannot express it, neither eye nor ear can apprehend it. This is the view of St. Jerome, who writes, "Non solum do physicis, sed de ethicis quoque scirc difficile est. Nec sermo valet explicare causas natu-rasque rerum, nec oculus, ut rei poscit dignitas, intueri, nec auris, instituente doctore, ad summam scientiam pervenirc. Si enim nunc 'per speculum videmus in aenigmate; et ex parte cognoscimus, et ex parte prophetamus,' consequenter nec sermo potest explicate quod nescit; nec oculus in quo caecutit, aspiecre; nec auris, de quo dubitat, impleri." Delitzsch, Nowack, Wright, and others render, "All things are in restless activity;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. constant movement pervades the whole world, and yet no visible conclusion is attained. This, however true, does not seem to be the point insisted on by the author, whose intention is, as we have said, to show that man, like nature, is confined to a circle from which he cannot free himself; and though he uses all the powers with, which he is endowed to penetrate the enigma of life and to rise superior to his environments, he is wholly unable to effect anything in these matters. <span class="cmt_word">Man cannot utter it</span>. He cannot explain all things. Koheleth does not affirm that man can know nothing, that he can attain to no certitude, that reason will not teach him to apprehend any truth; his contention is that the inner cause and meaning elude his faculties, that his knowledge is concerned only with accidents and externals, and that there is still some depth which his powers cannot fathom. <span class="cmt_word">The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> Use his eight as he may, listen to the sounds around him, attend to the instructions of professed teachers, man makes no real advance in knowledge of the mysteries in which he is involved; the paradox is inexplicable. We have, in <a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, "Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and the eyes of man are never satisfied." Plumptre quotes Lucretins's expression (2. 1038)," Fessus satiate videndi." "Remember," says Thomas a Kempis ('De Imitat.,' 1:1.5), "the proverb, that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing. Eudeavour, therefore, to withdraw thy heart from the love of visible things, and to transfer thyself to the invisible. For they that follow their sensuality do stain their conscience and lose the grace of God." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">things</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
