Biblically, searching is often associated with seeking God (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>) or His wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4-5</a>). The act of searching implies a sense of purpose and determination, reflecting the human desire to find meaning and fulfillment. In the historical context of ancient Israel, searching could also relate to the pursuit of lost property or reconciliation with others.<p><b>and a time to count as lost</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the reality of loss and the necessity of recognizing when something cannot be recovered. It reflects the wisdom in accepting limitations and moving forward. In biblical terms, this can relate to the concept of surrendering to God's will, as seen in Job's acceptance of his losses (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>). The cultural context of the time would have understood loss in terms of both material possessions and relationships, emphasizing the importance of discernment in knowing when to let go.<p><b>a time to keep</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of preservation and stewardship. In biblical terms, keeping can refer to maintaining faithfulness to God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>) or safeguarding what is valuable, whether it be relationships, possessions, or spiritual truths. The historical context of ancient Israel placed great value on the preservation of family heritage and land, which were seen as blessings from God.<p><b>and a time to discard</b><br>This phrase suggests the necessity of letting go of what is no longer beneficial or necessary. Biblically, this can be seen in the call to cast off sin (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>) or to leave behind old ways of life (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>). The cultural context would have understood discarding in terms of purifying one's life and community, removing what is unclean or detrimental. This reflects a broader spiritual principle of renewal and transformation, aligning with the teachings of Jesus on prioritizing the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The verb <span class="accented">abad</span>, in piel, is used in the sense of "to destroy" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>), and it is only in late Hebrew that it signifies, as here, "to lose." The reference is doubtless to property, and has no connection with the last clause of the preceding verse, as Delitzsch would opine. There is a proper and lawful pursuit of wealth, and there is a wise and prudent submission to its inevitable loss. The loss here is occasioned by events over which the owner has no control, differing from that in the next clause, which is voluntary. The wise man knows when to exert his energy in improving his fortune, and when to hold his hand and take failure without useless struggle. Loss, too, is sometimes gain, as when Christ's departure in the flesh was the prelude and the occasion of the sending of the Comforter (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>); and there are many things of which we know not the real value till they are beyond our grasp. <span class="cmt_word">A time to keep, and a time to cast away.</span> Prudence will make fast what it has won, and will endeavor to preserve it unimpaired. But there are occasions when it is wiser to deprive one's self of some things in order to secure more important ends, as when sailors throw a cargo, etc., overboard in order to save their ship (comp. <a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>; <a href="/acts/27-18.htm">Acts 27:18, 19, 38</a>). And in higher matters, such as almsgiving, this maxim holds good: "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth.... The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be watered also himself" (<a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24, 25</a>).
