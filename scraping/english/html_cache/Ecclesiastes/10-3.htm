In ancient Israel, roads were common places for travel and interaction, symbolizing life's journey. The fool's behavior is not hidden but evident to all who observe him. Biblically, the "fool" often represents someone who rejects wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. The road can also symbolize the path of life, where choices reflect one's character and wisdom.<p><b>his sense is lacking</b><br>This indicates a deficiency in judgment or discernment. In the Hebrew context, "sense" often refers to the heart or mind, the center of decision-making. The fool's lack of sense is not merely intellectual but moral and spiritual, reflecting a failure to live according to God's wisdom. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/28-26.htm">Proverbs 28:26</a>, which warns that those who trust in themselves are fools, but those who walk in wisdom are kept safe. The fool's lack of sense is a spiritual condition, highlighting the importance of seeking divine wisdom.<p><b>and he shows everyone that he is a fool</b><br>The fool's actions are self-revealing, making his folly apparent to all. This public display of foolishness contrasts with the wise, who are often discreet and prudent. In biblical literature, a fool's behavior is often characterized by arrogance, rashness, and a lack of self-control, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>, where a prudent man conceals knowledge, but the heart of fools proclaims folly. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that one's actions reveal their true character, and it serves as a warning to live wisely and righteously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Ecclesiastes, the fool represents someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often making poor decisions and displaying a lack of discernment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road.htm">The Road</a></b><br>Symbolically, the road represents the journey of life.

But it is better, as well as more obvious, to take the verse of the self-betrayal of the fool (<a href="/proverbs/13-16.htm" title="Every prudent man deals with knowledge: but a fool lays open his folly.">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/17-28.htm" title="Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise: and he that shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.">Proverbs 17:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-2.htm" title="A fool has no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.">Proverbs 18:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way.</span> As soon as ever he sets his foot outside the house, and mixes with other men, he exhibits his folly. If he remained at home he might keep his real ineptitude concealed; but such persons as he are unconscious of their inanity, and take no pains to hide it; they go where, they act as, their foolish heart prompts them. There is no metaphor here, nor any reference to the fool being put in the right path and perversely turning away. It is simply, as the Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="cmt_word">His wisdom</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">heart</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faileth him</span>.

But Delitzsch and Wright consider the order of the words and the suffix to be against this view, and they translate as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his understanding is at fault. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith to every one that he is a fool.</span> The sentence is ambiguous, and capable of two interpretations. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Cumipse insipiens sit, omnes stultos aestimat</span>. Jerome quotes Symmachus as rendering, "He suspects all men that they are fools." According to this view, the fool in his conceit thinks that every one he meets is a fool, says this in his mind, like the sluggard in <a href="/proverbs/26-16.htm">Proverbs 26:16</a>, "Who is wiser in his own conceit than ten men that can render a reason." Another explanation, more closely in accordance with the foregoing clauses, takes the pronoun in "he is a fool" to refer to the man himself, <span class="accented">se</span> <span class="accented">esse stultum</span> (comp. <a href="/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>:21 [20], "Let the nations know themselves to be but men"). As soon as he goes abroad, his words and actions display his real character; he betrays himself; he says virtually to all with whom he has to do, "I am a fool" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>).
