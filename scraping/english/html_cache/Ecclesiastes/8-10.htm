In ancient Israel, burial was a significant event, often reflecting one's status and reputation. The wicked receiving a proper burial suggests a societal failure to recognize or address their moral corruption. This can be contrasted with the fate of the righteous, who sometimes suffer unjustly (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>). The burial of the wicked may also imply a temporary triumph of evil, as seen in <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3-12</a>, where the prosperity of the wicked is lamented.<p><b>who used to go in and out of the holy place</b><br>The "holy place" likely refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central location for worship and religious activities. The wicked going in and out of the temple suggests hypocrisy and a superficial adherence to religious practices. This behavior is reminiscent of the Pharisees in the New Testament, whom Jesus criticized for their outward piety but inward corruption (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>). The presence of the wicked in the holy place underscores the tension between true worship and mere ritual.<p><b>and they were praised in the city where they had done so</b><br>The wicked being praised in the city indicates a societal blindness or complicity in their actions. This reflects a cultural context where reputation and public perception can be manipulated, often ignoring true character. The city, likely Jerusalem, serves as a microcosm of broader societal values. This situation parallels the lament in <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>, where good is called evil and evil good. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where true justice will be revealed (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><b>This too is futile</b><br>The declaration of futility emphasizes the theme of vanity and meaninglessness that permeates Ecclesiastes. Despite the apparent success and honor of the wicked, their end is ultimately empty and unsatisfying. This echoes the broader message of Ecclesiastes that earthly achievements and accolades are transient and cannot provide lasting fulfillment. The futility here serves as a reminder of the need for divine justice and the hope of eternal truth, as seen in the ultimate fulfillment through Jesus Christ, who embodies true wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Individuals who live in opposition to God's commandments, often engaging in sinful behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_place.htm">The Holy Place</a></b><br>Likely refers to the temple or a place of worship where religious activities are conducted.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Represents the community or society that observes and often praises the wicked despite their actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burial.htm">Burial</a></b><br>The event of the wicked being buried, symbolizing the end of their earthly life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who reflects on the futility of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_earthly_praise.htm">The Illusion of Earthly Praise</a></b><br>Earthly praise is fleeting and often misplaced.

Their decorated tombs and glowing eulogies look impressive but add up to nothing before God. The scene exposes the hollowness of human applause and the insufficiency of outward religion. In a world where hypocrites may be buried with fanfare, Scripture reassures us that the final word belongs to the Lord, who sees hearts, judges justly, and renders all earthly vanity meaningless without genuine, obedient faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">They had so done.--</span>An ambiguity in translation of this verse arises from the fact that the word translated "so" is rendered "well" (<a href="/2_kings/7-9.htm" title="Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come on us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.">2Kings 7:9</a> and elsewhere). Consequently some understand the verse, "The wicked receive an honourable burial, while those who have acted well are driven away from the holy place (viz. Jerusalem, <a href="/isaiah/48-2.htm" title="For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.">Isaiah 48:2</a>; Neh. xi, 1, 18) and forgotten." But we prefer to translate the word "so" the second time, as well as the first, where it occurs in the verse; and to take the meaning to be that the oppressor's prosperity is but temporary, for soon comes death, burial, and forgetfulness of his honour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-15.</span> - Section 6. Koheleth is troubled by apparent anomalies in God's moral government. He notes <span class="accented">the prosperity of the godless and the misery of the righteous</span>, God's abstention and the seeming impunity of sinners make men incredulous of Providence; but God is just in reward and punishment, as the end will prove. Meantime, returning to his old maxim, he advises men patiently to acquiesce in things as they are, and to make the best of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>); then, in like manner, under the same circumstances (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). The writer notes some apparent exceptions to the law of retribution of which he has just been speaking, the double particle at the beginning of the verse implying the connection with the preceding statement. <span class="cmt_word">I saw the wicked buried</span>. "The wicked" are especially the despots (ver. 9). These are carried to their graves with every outward honor and respect, like the rich man in the parable, who "died, and was buried" (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>). Such men, if they had received their due reward, far from having a pompous and magnificent funeral (which would befit only a good and honored life), would have been buried with the burial of an ass (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). So far the Authorized Version is undeniably correct. What follows is as certainly inaccurate as it is unintelligible. <span class="cmt_word">Who had come and gone from the place of the holy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and they came, and from the place of the holy they went</span>. The first verb seems to mean, "they came to their rest," they died a natural death. The words, in themselves ambiguous, are explained by the connection in which they stand (comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). Wright renders, "they came into being," and explains it with the following clause, "they went away from the holy place," as one generation coming and another going, in constant succession. But if, as we suppose, the paragraph applies to the despot, such an interpretation is unsuitable. Cox's idea, that oppressive despots "come again" in the persons of their wicked children, is wholly unsupported by the text. The verse admits and has received a dozen explanations differing more or less from one another. A good deal depends upon the manner in which the succeeding clause is translated, <span class="cmt_word">And they were forgotten in the city where they had so done.</span> As the particle rendered "so" (<span class="accented">ken</span>) may also mean "well," "rightly," we get the rendering, "even such as acted justly," and thus introduce a contrast between the fate of the wicked man who is honored with a sumptuous funeral, and that of the righteous whose name is cast out as pollution and soon forgotten. So Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') gives, "And in accordance with this I have seen ungodly men honored, and that too in the holy place (the temple, <a href="/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), but those who had acted rightly had to depart, and were forgotten in the city." Against this interpretation, which has been adopted by many, it may reasonably be urged that in the same verse <span class="accented">ken</span> would hardly be used in two different senses, and that there is nothing in the text to indicate a change of subject. It seems to me that the whole verse applies to the wicked man. He dies in peace, he leaves the holy place; the evil that he has done is forgotten in the very city where he had so done, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> done wickedly. "The place of the holy" is Jerusalem (<a href="/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>) or the temple (<a href="/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>). He is removed by death from that spot, the very name of which ought to have cried shame on his crimes and impiety. The expression seems to picture a great procession of priests and Levites accompanying the corpse of the deceased tyrant to the place of burial, while the final clause implies that no long lamentation was made over him, no monument erected to his memory (see the opposite of this in the treatment of Josiah, <a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>). They who consider "the righteous " to be the subject of the last clauses see in the words, "from the holy place they departed," an intimation that these were excommunicated from the synagogue or temple, or banished from the promised land, on account of their opinions. I would translate the passage thus: <span class="accented">In like manner have I seen the wicked buried, and they came to their rest, and they went from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city where they had so</span> (wickedly) acted. The versions have followed various readings. Thus the Septuagint: "And then I saw the impious brought unto graves, and from the holy place; and they departed and were praised in the city, because they had so done;" Vulgate, "I have seen the impious buried, who also, while they still lived, were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as if men of just doings." Commenting oh this version, St. Gregory writes, "The very tranquility of the peace of the Church conceals many under the Christian name who are beset with the plague of their own wickedness. But if a light breath of persecution strikes them, it sweeps them away at once as chaff from the threshing-floor. But some persons wish to bear the mark of Christian calling, because, since the name of Christ has been exalted on high, nearly all persons now look to appear faithful, and from seeing others called thus, they are ashamed not to seem faithful themselves; but they neglect to be that which they beast of being called. For they assume the reality of inward excellence, to adorn their outward appearance; and they who stand before the heavenly Judge, naked from the unbelief of their heart, are clothed, in the sight of men, with a holy profession, at least in words" ('Moral.,' 25:26). <span class="cmt_word">This is also vanity</span>. The old refrain recurs to the writer as he thinks on the prosperity of the wicked, and the conclusions which infidels draw therefrom. Here is another example of the vanity that prevails in all earthly circumstances. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then too,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1441;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124;
