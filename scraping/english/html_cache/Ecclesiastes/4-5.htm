In biblical times, folding one's hands was a metaphor for inactivity and neglect of responsibilities. <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10-11</a> warns against such behavior, indicating that laziness leads to poverty. The "fool" in biblical literature often represents someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, ignoring the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This imagery of folding hands contrasts with the diligent worker who is commended throughout Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13-27</a>).<p><b>and consumes his own flesh.</b><br>This vivid expression implies self-destruction and the consequences of laziness. In a cultural context, consuming one's own flesh can be seen as a metaphor for self-harm or ruin due to neglect and idleness. It reflects the idea that laziness leads to a lack of provision, resulting in metaphorical or even literal starvation. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/isaiah/9-20.htm">Isaiah 9:20</a>, where people are described as devouring their own flesh due to internal strife and sin. Theologically, it underscores the destructive nature of sin and folly, contrasting with the life-giving wisdom found in Christ, who offers sustenance and fulfillment (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In biblical literature, the fool is often characterized by a lack of wisdom, understanding, and reverence for God.

But it has been proposed, taking the verse in connection with that which precedes and those which follow, to understand them literally, "eats his meat;" the sense being that, considering the emulation and envy involved in all successful exertion, one is tempted to say that the sluggard does better who eats his meat in quiet. There is, however, no exact parallel to the phrase "eats <span class= "ital">his </span>flesh;" and I think that if the latter were the meaning intended, it would have been formally introduced in some such way as, "Wherefore I praised the sluggard." Adopting, then, the ancient interpretation, we understand the course of conduct recommended to be the golden mean between the ruinous sloth of the fool and the vexatious toil of the ambitious man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The connection of this verse with the preceding is this: activity, diligence, and skill indeed bring success, but success is accompanied by sad results. Should we, then, sink into apathy, relinquish work, let things slide? Nay, none but the fool (<span class="accented">kesil</span>), the insensate, half-brutish man, doth this. <span class="cmt_word">The fool foldeth his hands together</span>. The attitude expresses laziness and disinclination for active labor, like that of the sluggard in <a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And eateth his own flesh</span>. Ginsburg, Plumptre, and others take these words to mean "and yet eats his meat," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. gets that enjoyment from his sluggishness which is denied to active diligence. They refer, in proof of this interpretation, to <a href="/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, in which passages, however, the phrase is never equivalent to "eating his food." The expression is really equivalent to "destroys himself," "brings ruin upon himself." Thus we have in <a href="/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, "Evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh;" and in <a href="/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>, "Who eat the flesh of my people" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>). The sluggard is guilty of moral suicide; he takes no trouble to provide for his necessities, and suffers extremities in consequence. Some see in this verse and the following an objection and its answer. There is no occasion for this view, and it is not in keeping with the context; but it contains an intimation of the true exposition, which makes ver. 6 a proverbial statement of the sluggard's position. The verbs in the text are participial in form, so that the Vulgate rendering, which supplies a verb, is quite admissible: <span class="accented">Stultus complicat manna suas</span>, <span class="accented">et comedit carnes suas</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>: <span class="accented">Melior est</span>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">folds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2263.htm">Strong's 2263: </a> </span><span class="str2">To clasp, embrace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his hands</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and consumes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own flesh.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1320.htm">Strong's 1320: </a> </span><span class="str2">Flesh, body, person, the pudenda of a, man</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 4:5 The fool folds his hands together (Ecclesiast.
