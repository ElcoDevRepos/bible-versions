In the biblical context, "greatness" often refers to wealth, power, and influence. Solomon's greatness is documented in <a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23</a>, where it states that King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. His greatness was not only in material wealth but also in his extensive building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem, which was a significant architectural and religious achievement.<p><b>and surpassed all in Jerusalem who had preceded me;</b><br>Solomon's claim to have surpassed all who preceded him in Jerusalem highlights his unique position in Israel's history. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual center of Israel, was the city of David, Solomon's father, who established it as the capital. Solomon's surpassing of his predecessors can be seen in his expansion of the kingdom, his international trade relations, and his renowned wisdom. This phrase also underscores the historical context of the united monarchy, a period of relative peace and prosperity in Israel's history.<p><b>and my wisdom remained with me.</b><br>Despite his pursuit of worldly achievements, Solomon asserts that his wisdom remained intact. This wisdom, granted by God as described in <a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>, was a defining characteristic of Solomon's reign. It allowed him to make judicious decisions and gain a reputation for understanding and insight. However, the narrative of Ecclesiastes suggests a tension between human wisdom and divine wisdom, as Solomon reflects on the limitations and vanity of earthly pursuits. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of wisdom literature, which includes Proverbs and Job, exploring the nature of true wisdom and its application in life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, significant as the political and spiritual center during Solomon's reign.

In accordance with the purpose mentioned in ver. 3, he retained command of himself, studying philosophically the effects and nature of the pleasures of which he partook, and keeping ever in view the object of his pursuit.
