In the context of ancient Israel, community and family were central to daily life. The Bible often highlights the importance of relationships, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, where God states, "It is not good for the man to be alone." This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, emphasizing that humans are designed for fellowship and mutual support. The idea of two being better than one can also be seen in the New Testament, where Jesus sends out His disciples in pairs (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), underscoring the strength and encouragement found in partnership.<p><b>because they have a good return for their labor.</b><br>This phrase suggests that collaboration leads to greater productivity and success. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, working together in fields or other labor-intensive tasks would yield better results than working alone. The principle of reaping a good return is also a spiritual metaphor found in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which encourages believers not to grow weary in doing good, for in due season they will reap a harvest. The concept of a "good return" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who through His partnership with humanity, brought about the ultimate return&#8212;salvation and eternal life for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

From the start He declared, &#8220;It is not good for the man to be alone&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>). Companionship is woven into creation.<p>&#8226; When we stand shoulder to shoulder, strengths combine and weaknesses diminish. <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a> reminds us, &#8220;As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.&#8221; Growth happens in relationship, not isolation.<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed this principle: &#8220;For where two or three gather together in My name, there am I with them&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). Fellowship invites His presence and power in ways solitary effort cannot replicate.<p>&#8226; Regular gathering fuels perseverance. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a> urges believers to meet and &#8220;spur one another on to love and good deeds,&#8221; underscoring that mutual encouragement is essential, not optional.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because they have a good return for their labor</b><p>&#8226; Shared work multiplies results. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a> paints the picture: one can chase a thousand, but two put ten thousand to flight&#8212;an exponential gain that comes only through cooperation.<p>&#8226; Tangible productivity follows united effort. &#8220;There is profit in all hard work&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>), yet Solomon notes the profit is markedly higher when tasks are tackled together.<p>&#8226; Kingdom service illustrates this truth. Paul wrote, &#8220;He who plants and he who waters are one &#8230; each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8-9</a>). Different roles, one harvest, greater reward.<p>&#8226; Prayer increases in effectiveness when believers agree: &#8220;If two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a>). Spiritual dividends rise when hearts unite.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;good return&#8221; extends beyond this life. <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a> promises a coming harvest &#8220;if we do not give up,&#8221; pointing to eternal reward for cooperative faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a> highlights God&#8217;s design for community.
