Silver and gold were not only forms of currency but also symbols of power and status. The phrase reflects the historical context of King Solomon, who was renowned for his wealth and wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-23</a>). The mention of "the treasure of kings and provinces" suggests tribute or spoils from other nations, indicating Solomon's extensive influence and the prosperity of his reign. This accumulation of wealth is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, where kings are cautioned against amassing excessive wealth, highlighting the potential for material possessions to lead one's heart away from God.<p><b>I gathered to myself male and female singers,</b><br>Music and entertainment were significant aspects of royal life in ancient Israel and surrounding cultures. Male and female singers were often part of the royal court, providing entertainment and enhancing the cultural richness of the kingdom. This practice is seen in other parts of the Bible, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>, where music is mentioned as a source of joy and celebration. The inclusion of both male and female singers indicates a comprehensive approach to entertainment, reflecting the opulence and cultural sophistication of Solomon's court.<p><b>and the delights of the sons of men&#8212;many concubines.</b><br>The phrase "delights of the sons of men" refers to pleasures and indulgences that are highly valued by humanity. In Solomon's context, this included a large harem, as indicated by the mention of "many concubines." Solomon's numerous wives and concubines are documented in <a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>, where it is noted that he had 700 wives and 300 concubines. This practice, while common among ancient Near Eastern kings to form political alliances, was contrary to God's design for marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>) and led to Solomon's spiritual downfall, as his foreign wives turned his heart toward other gods (<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>). This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pursuing earthly pleasures and the importance of remaining faithful to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.

Much is said of the wealth of the historical Solomon, who had all his vessels of gold, armed his body-guard with golden shields, sat on an ivory throne overlaid with gold, received tribute and presents of gold from all quarters, sent his navies to distant lands to import precious metals, and made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones (see <a href="/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces</span>. The word rendered "the provinces" (<span class="accented">hammedinoth</span>), in spite of the article, seems to mean, not the twelve districts into which Solomon divided his kingdom for fiscal and economical purposes (<a href="/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, etc.), but countries generally exterior to Palestine, with which he had commercial or political relations, and which sent to him the productions for which they were each most celebrated. So the districts of the Persian empire were required to furnish the monarch with a certain portion of their chief commodities. His friendship with Hiram of Tyro brought him into connection with the Phoeni-clans, the greatest commercial nation of antiquity, and through them he accumulated riches and stores from distant and various lands beyond the limits of the Mediterranean Sea. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">medinah</span>) occurs again in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a> and in <a href="/1_kings/20-14.htm">1 Kings 20:14</a>, etc.; but is found elsewhere only in exilian or post-exilian books (e.g. <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, etc.). The "kings" may be the tributary monarchs, such as those of Arabia (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>); or the expression in the text may imply simply such treasure as only kings, and not private persons, could possess. <span class="cmt_word">Men-singers and women-singers.</span> These, of course, are not the choir of the temple, of which women formed no part, bur. musicians introduced at banquets and social festivals, to enhance the pleasures of the scene. They are mentioned in David's days (<a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>) and later (see <a href="/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 35:5 Ecclus. 49:1). The females who took part in these performances were generally of an abandoned class; hence the, warning of Ben-Sira, "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts" (Ecclus. 9:4). Such exhibitions were usually accompanied with dancing, the character of which in Eastern countries is well known. The Jews, as time went on, learned to tolerate many customs and practices, imported often from other lands, which tended to lower morality and self-respect. <span class="cmt_word">And the delights of the sons of men;</span> the sensual pleasures that men enjoy. The expression is euphemistic (comp. <a href="/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Musical instruments, and that of all sorts</span> (<span class="accented">shiddah veshiddoth</span>). The word (given here first in the singular number and then in the plural emphatically to express multitude) occurs nowhere else, and has, therefore, been subjected to various interpretations. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "a male cupbearer and female cupbearers;" and so the Syrian and. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad vina fundenda</span> - which introduces rather a bathos into the description. After the clause immediately preceding, one might expect mention of Solomon's numerous harem (<a href="/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>; <a href="/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>), and most modern commentators consider the word to mean "concubine," the whole expression denoting multiplicity, "wife and wives." The Authorized Version is not very probable, though somewhat supported by Kimchi, Luther, etc., and the Greek Venetian, which has, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a musical term signifying "combination of tones," or harmony. Other interpretations are "captives," "litters," "coaches," "baths," "treasures," "chests," "demons." Ewald, followed by Motais and others, suggests that the word implies a strong or high degree of a quality, so that, connecting the two clauses together, we should render, "And in a word, all the delights of the sons of men in abundance." This seems a more appropriate termination to the catalogue than any specification of further sources of pleasure; but there is no very strong etymological reason to recommend it; and we can hardly suppose that, in the enumeration of Solomon's prodigalities, his multitudinous seraglio would be omitted. Rather it comes in here naturally as the climax and completion of his pursuit of earthly delight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">accumulated</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1463;&#1444;&#1505;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;&#183;nas&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3664.htm">Strong's 3664: </a> </span><span class="str2">To collect, to enfold</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for myself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
