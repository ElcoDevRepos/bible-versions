Biblically, prosperity is often seen as a blessing from God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>, where obedience leads to blessings. Joy in prosperity is a theme echoed in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/126-3.htm">Psalm 126:3</a>, which speaks of the Lord doing great things for His people, resulting in joy. The cultural context of ancient Israel valued communal celebrations during harvests and festivals, reflecting gratitude for God's provision.<p><b>but in the day of adversity, consider this:</b><br>Adversity is a common theme throughout Scripture, often seen as a time for reflection and growth. <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a> speaks of trials producing perseverance and maturity. The phrase suggests a shift from joy to contemplation, urging believers to seek understanding and wisdom during difficult times. Historically, Israel faced numerous adversities, from captivity to exile, which were seen as opportunities for repentance and reliance on God.<p><b>God has made one of these along with the other,</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty over both prosperity and adversity. Theologically, it reflects the belief that God is in control of all circumstances, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where God declares He forms light and creates darkness. This duality is part of the divine plan, teaching reliance on God rather than on circumstances. The balance of prosperity and adversity is a recurring theme in the wisdom literature, emphasizing the unpredictability of life and the need for trust in God.<p><b>so that a man cannot discover anything that will come after him.</b><br>This phrase highlights human limitations in understanding the future, a theme prevalent in Ecclesiastes. It echoes the sentiment in <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>, which speaks of life as a mist, here today and gone tomorrow. The inability to predict the future underscores the need for faith and dependence on God. In a broader biblical context, it points to the mystery of God's plans, as seen in <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-34</a>, where God's judgments and ways are described as unsearchable and beyond tracing out.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The first clause may be more closely rendered, "In the good day be of good cheer." As a consolation in time of adversity the thought <a href="/job/2-10.htm" title="But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.">Job 2:10</a> is offered. The last clause connects itself with the first, the idea being that of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm" title="Why I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; "take the present enjoyment which God gives, seeing that man cannot tell what shall be after him."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day of prosperity be joyful</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the day of good be in good i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when things go well with you, be cheerful (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>; <a href="/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>); accept the situation and enjoy it. The advice is the same as that which runs through the book, viz. to make the best of the present. So Ben-Sire says, "Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not a share in a good desire pass thee by" (Ecclus. 14:14). Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span>, "In a day of good live in (an atmosphere of) good;" Vulgate, in <span class="accented">die bona fruere bonis</span>, "In a good day enjoy your good things." <span class="cmt_word">But in the day of adversity consider</span>; <span class="accented">in the evil day look well</span>. The writer could not conclude this clause so as to make it parallel with the other, or he would have had to say, "In the ill day take it ill," which would be far from his meaning; so he introduces a thought which may help to make one resigned to adversity. The reflection follows. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et malam diem praecave</span>, "Beware of the evil day." But, doubtless, the object of the verb is the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">God also hath set the one over against the other</span>; or, <span class="accented">God hath made the one corresponding to the other</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he hath made the day of evil as well as the day of good. The light and shade in man's life are equally under God's ordering and permission. "What?" cries Job (<a href="/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>), "shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" Corn. Lapide quotes a saying of Plutarch to this effect: the harp gives forth sounds acute and grave, and both combine to form the melody; so in man's life the mingling of prosperity and adversity yields a well-adjusted harmony. God strikes all the strings of our life's harp, and we ought, not only patiently, but cheerfully, to listen to the chords produced by this Divine Performer. <span class="cmt_word">To the end that man should find nothing after him.</span> This clause gives Koheleth's view of God's object in the admixture of good and evil; but the reason has been variously interpreted, the explanation depending on the sense assigned to the term "after him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>). The Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is vague; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">contra eum</span>, meaning that man may have no occasion to complain against God. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') considers that Koheleth here implies that death closes the scene, and that there is then nothing more to fear, rendering the clause, "On the ground that man is to experience nothing at all hereafter." They who believe that the writer held the doctrine of a future life cannot acquiesce in this view. The interpretation of Delitzsch is this - God lets man pass through the whole discipline of good and evil, that when lie dies there may be nothing which he has not experienced. Hitzig and Nowack explain the text to mean that, as God designs that man after his death shall have done with all things, he sends upon him evil as well as good, that he may not have to punish him hereafter - a doctrine opposed to the teaching of a future judgment. Wright deems the idea to be that man may be kept in ignorance of what shall happen to him beyond the grave, that the present life may afford no clue to the future. One does not see why this should be a comfort, nor how it is compatible with God's known counsel of making the condition of the future life dependent upon the conduct of this. Other explanations being more or less unsatisfactory, many modern commentators see in the passage an assertion that God intermingle8 good and evil in men's lives according to laws with which they are unacquainted, in order that they may not disquiet themselves by forecasting the future, whether in this life or after their death, but may be wholly dependent upon God, casting all their care upon him, knowing that he careth for them (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). We may safely adopt this explanation (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>). The paragraph then con-rains the same teaching as Horace's oft-quoted ode- <p><span class="foreign">"Prudens futuri temporis exitum,"</span> etc.<br />(<span class="note_acc">Carm.,' 3:29. 29.</span>) Theognis', 1075 - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>,<br /><br /><span class="accented">"The issue of an action incomplete,<br />Tis hard to forecast how God may dispose it;<br />For it is veiled in darkest night, and man<br />In present hour can never comprehend<br />His helpless efforts."</span> Plumptre quotes the lines in Cleanthes's hymn to Zeus, vers. 18-21 ('Poet.
