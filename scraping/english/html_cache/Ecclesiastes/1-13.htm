Solomon, known for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), uses his God-given gift to investigate life's complexities. This pursuit of wisdom is a central theme in biblical literature, emphasizing the importance of understanding and discernment (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>). The act of seeking and exploring suggests a comprehensive and thorough examination, reflecting the intellectual curiosity that characterizes much of the wisdom literature.<p><b>all that is done under heaven</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entirety of human activity and existence. "Under heaven" is a poetic way of referring to life on earth, highlighting the scope of Solomon's inquiry. The phrase suggests a universal perspective, considering not just individual or national concerns but the human condition as a whole. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all creation (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>) and the futility of human endeavors apart from divine purpose (<a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p><b>What a miserable task</b><br>The term "miserable" conveys a sense of burden and futility. This reflects the recurring theme in Ecclesiastes of the vanity and fleeting nature of human efforts (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>). The task of understanding life and its purpose can be overwhelming and disheartening, especially when viewed apart from God's eternal perspective. This sentiment echoes the human struggle with meaning and the limitations of human wisdom (<a href="/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12-28</a>).<p><b>God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty in assigning the task of seeking wisdom and understanding to humanity. It suggests that the pursuit of knowledge and meaning is part of God's design for human life, intended to engage and challenge people. The "sons of men" refers to all humanity, emphasizing the universal nature of this endeavor. This aligns with the biblical view that God has placed eternity in human hearts (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>), prompting a search for purpose and understanding. The task, while burdensome, is also an invitation to seek God and His wisdom (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

"I gave my heart" is the same as "I applied my mind." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave my heart</span> (ver. 17; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>). The heart, in the Hebrew conception, was the seat, not of the affections only, but of the understanding and intellectual faculties generally. So the expression here is equivalent to "I applied my mind." <span class="cmt_word">To seek and search out.</span> The two words are not synonymous. The former verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">darash</span>) implies penetrating into the depth of an object before one; the other word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">tur</span>) taking a comprehensive survey of matters further away; so that two methods and scopes of investigation are signified. <span class="cmt_word">By wisdom</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (Septuagint).

The same root is found in the word translated "exercised;" hence Wright has, "It is a woeful exercise which God has given to the sons of men wherewith to exercise themselves." If we <span class="accented">keep</span> to the word "travail," we may render, "to travail <span class="accented">therein</span>." It implies distracting business, engrossing occupation.

"God" is here <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and so throughout the book, the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (the God of the covenant, the God of Israel) never once occurring. Those who regard Solomon as the author of the book account for this on the plea that the king, in his latest years, reflecting sadly on his backsliding and fall, shrank from uttering with his polluted lips the adorable Name once so often used with filial reverence and beloved. But the true reason is found in the design of Koheleth, which was to set forth, not so much Israel's position under the covenant, as the condition of man in the face of the God of nature.
