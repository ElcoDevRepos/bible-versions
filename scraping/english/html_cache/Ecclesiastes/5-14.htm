In the ancient Near Eastern context, economic ventures were often risky due to factors like unpredictable weather, political instability, and trade route dangers. The Bible frequently warns against placing trust in wealth (<a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a> echoes this sentiment, illustrating the folly of hoarding wealth without regard for spiritual matters. The loss of wealth can serve as a reminder of the impermanence of earthly treasures and the importance of storing up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>so when that man has a son</b><br>The mention of a son underscores the cultural importance of inheritance in biblical times. Inheritance was not only a means of providing for one's descendants but also a way to ensure the continuation of the family line and legacy. The loss of wealth would have been particularly distressing in this context, as it could jeopardize the future security and status of one's offspring. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational blessings and responsibilities (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>there is nothing to pass on</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the ultimate futility of relying on material wealth for lasting security. The Bible consistently teaches that true inheritance is spiritual rather than material (<a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3-4</a>). The inability to pass on wealth serves as a metaphor for the transient nature of earthly life and possessions. It points to the need for a legacy rooted in faith and righteousness, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Abraham, who was promised a spiritual inheritance through his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This also foreshadows the eternal inheritance believers receive through Jesus Christ, who offers a kingdom that cannot be shaken (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and building projects, including the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation where Solomon reigned, representing a people chosen by God, often experiencing cycles of faithfulness and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth.htm">Wealth</a></b><br>In this context, wealth refers to material possessions and financial resources, which are often seen as blessings but can also be fleeting and uncertain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bad_venture.htm">Bad Venture</a></b><br>This refers to risky or unwise financial endeavors that can lead to the loss of wealth, highlighting the unpredictability of human efforts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/son.htm">Son</a></b><br>Represents the next generation, emphasizing the importance of legacy and inheritance in biblical times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_uncertainty_of_wealth.htm">The Uncertainty of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth is not a reliable foundation for security or happiness.

There is no need to confine the cause of the loss to unsuccessful business, as many commentators do. The rich man does not seem to be a tradesman or speculator; he loses his property, like Job, by visitations for which he is in no way answerable - by storm or tempest, by robbers, by fire, by exactions, or by lawsuits. <span class="cmt_word">And he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</span> The verb rendered "begetteth" is in the past tense, and used as it were, hypothetically, equivalent to "hath he begotten a son," supposing he has a son. His misery is doubled by the reflection that he has lost all hope of securing a fortune for his children, or founding a family, or passing on an inheritance to posterity. It is doubtful to whom the pronoun "his" refers. Many consider that the father is meant, and the clause says that when he has begotten a son, he finds he has nothing to give him. But the suffix seems most naturally to refer to the son, who is thus left a pauper. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Generavit filium qui in summa egestate erit</span>.
