Quarrying stones was a common occupation in biblical times, essential for building structures such as temples, homes, and city walls. The process involved cutting and extracting large stones from the earth, which was physically demanding and dangerous. Injuries could occur from falling rocks, mishandling tools, or the collapse of quarry walls. This serves as a metaphor for the unpredictability and potential hazards of life, emphasizing the need for wisdom and caution in all endeavors. The imagery of stones can also be connected to the "living stones" mentioned in <a href="/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>, where believers are built into a spiritual house, suggesting that even in spiritual work, there are challenges and risks.<p><b>and he who splits logs endangers himself</b><br>Log splitting was another essential task in ancient times, necessary for building, heating, and cooking. The danger lay in the use of sharp tools like axes, which could cause injury if not handled properly. This phrase underscores the theme of risk in everyday activities, reminding readers of the need for skill and prudence. The act of splitting logs can be seen as a metaphor for division or conflict, where carelessness can lead to harm. In a broader biblical context, this can be related to the division of the kingdom of Israel after Solomon's reign (1 Kings 12), where lack of wisdom led to national strife. The imagery of wood can also be linked to the cross of Christ, where the ultimate act of sacrifice and redemption took place, highlighting that even in danger, there is a divine purpose.<div

A falling rock, an unexpected fracture, or simple fatigue can harm the quarryman.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a> puts the same truth another way: &#8220;He who digs a pit may fall into it.&#8221; Wisdom recognizes risk because creation is still under the curse of <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>; toil includes thorns and thistles, bruises and broken bones.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a> echoes the warning: &#8220;He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.&#8221; The point is not to avoid work but to approach it with foresight and humility.<p>&#8226; Practical wisdom flows from faith. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-8.htm">Deuteronomy 22:8</a> required a parapet on new rooftops so no one would fall&#8212;God&#8217;s people take precautions, valuing life as His gift.<p>&#8226; Personal application: work hard, but plan for hazards&#8212;wear the helmet, set the braces, rest when needed. <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> calls us to labor &#8220;as for the Lord,&#8221; which includes caring for the body He gave us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Splitting logs</b><p>&#8220; &#8230; and he who splits logs endangers himself &#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; A flying splinter, a misplaced swing of the axe, a toppled trunk&#8212;woodcutting illustrates how easily skill can meet catastrophe.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a> describes a man accidentally killing his friend when &#8220;the iron slips from the handle&#8221; while felling trees; accidents are not new.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a> adds, &#8220;If the axe is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed, but wisdom will bring success.&#8221; Sharpening the blade before swinging it is simple prudence&#8212;a spiritual parallel to keeping one&#8217;s heart sharp in the Word (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a> teaches, &#8220;The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.&#8221; A wise believer acknowledges both God&#8217;s sovereignty and personal responsibility.<p>&#8226; Personal application: schedule maintenance, seek training, and accept help. <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a> tells us to &#8220;carry one another&#8217;s burdens,&#8221; which may include spotting a friend while he drops a tree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/10-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:9</a> is a call to realistic, boots-on-the-ground wisdom.

For the latter sense, however, there is countenance in <a href="/2_kings/4-4.htm" title="And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.">2Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside."<p><span class= "bld">Cleaveth wood.--</span>Or, <span class= "ital">cutteth down trees, </span>an operation not free from danger (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm" title="As when a man goes into the wood with his neighbor to hew wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the ax to cut down the tree, and the head slips from the helve, and lights on his neighbor, that he die; he shall flee to one of those cities, and live:">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith</span>. It is natural to consider this clause as suggested by the breaking of a wall in the preceding verse; but as this would occasion a jejune repetition, it is better to take it of the work of the quarryman, as in <a href="/1_kings/5-17.htm">1 Kings 5:17</a>, where the same verb is used. The dangers to which such laborers are exposed are well known. Here, again, but unsuccessfully, some have seen a reference to the removal of landmarks, comparing <a href="/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside." As before said, the paragraph does not speak of retribution, but advises caution, enforcing the lesson by certain homely, allusions to the accidents that may occur m customary occupations. <span class="cmt_word">He that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span> Cutting up logs of wood, a man may hurt himself with axe or saw, or be injured by splinters, etc. If we take the idea to be the felling of trees, there is the danger of being crushed in their fall, or, according to the tenor of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>, of being killed inadvertently by a neighbor's axe. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui scindit ligna vulnerabitur ab eis</span>, which is more definite than the general term "endangered;" but the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the Authorized Version.
