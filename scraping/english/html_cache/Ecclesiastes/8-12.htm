The "hundred times" suggests habitual sinning, emphasizing the persistence of evil actions. The longevity of the sinner's life may seem unjust, echoing the sentiments found in <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, where the psalmist struggles with the prosperity of the wicked. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where long life was often seen as a sign of divine favor, creating a tension for the righteous observer.<p><b>yet I also know that it will go well with those who fear God</b><br>The phrase "I also know" indicates a confident assertion of faith despite the apparent success of the wicked. "Those who fear God" refers to individuals who live in reverence and obedience to God, a central theme in wisdom literature. This fear is not terror but a profound respect and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and justice. The assurance that "it will go well" aligns with promises found in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a> and <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where fearing God is associated with wisdom and blessing.<p><b>who are reverent in His presence</b><br>Reverence in God's presence implies a lifestyle of worship and submission, recognizing God's holiness and authority. This phrase underscores the importance of an ongoing relationship with God, reminiscent of the covenant relationship emphasized throughout the Old Testament. The presence of God was central to Israel's identity, symbolized by the tabernacle and later the temple. This reverence is a type of Christ, who perfectly exemplified living in God's presence and taught His followers to do the same, as seen in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sinner.htm">The Sinner</a></b><br>Represents those who live in opposition to God's commandments, engaging in repeated wrongdoing.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_god.htm">Those Who Fear God</a></b><br>Individuals who live in reverence and awe of God, aligning their lives with His will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>Traditionally understood to be Solomon, the author of Ecclesiastes, who reflects on the meaning of life and the fear of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure whose presence and reverence are the focus of the passage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_life's_injustices.htm">The Context of Life's Injustices</a></b><br>The broader theme in Ecclesiastes of observing life's apparent injustices and the ultimate justice of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_prosperity_for_the_wicked.htm">The Illusion of Prosperity for the Wicked</a></b><br>While sinners may appear to prosper and live long lives, this is not an indication of God's approval or the ultimate outcome.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_for_those_who_fear_god.htm">The Assurance for Those Who Fear God</a></b><br>Despite the apparent success of the wicked, those who fear God can be assured of His favor and ultimate justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reverence.htm">The Importance of Reverence</a></b><br>Revering God's presence is crucial for a life aligned with His will, leading to true well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to trust in God's timing and justice, even when life seems unfair.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_with_an_eternal_perspective.htm">Living with an Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Focusing on eternal rewards rather than temporary earthly success helps maintain faith and perseverance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_8_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 8:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_8_12_Persevere_in_righteousness.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 8:12 encourage perseverance in righteousness despite life's injustices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_8_12_on_God_s_justice.htm">What does Ecclesiastes 8:12 reveal about God's ultimate justice for the righteous?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Ecclesiastes_8_12_daily.htm">How can we apply the promise of Ecclesiastes 8:12 in daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Ecclesiastes_8_12_Romans_8_28.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 8:12 connect with Romans 8:28 about God's goodness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Eccles_8_12_boost_faith_in_timing.htm">In what ways does Ecclesiastes 8:12 strengthen your faith in God's timing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_8_12_vs_wicked_s_success.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 8:12 reconcile with the prosperity of the wicked?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_fear_God_if_the_wicked_succeed.htm">Why does Ecclesiastes 8:12 emphasize fearing God despite the wicked's apparent success?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Ecclesiastes_8_12.htm">What historical context influences the message of Ecclesiastes 8:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_ecclesiastes_8.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Ecclesiastes 8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_the_wicked_prosper_in_divine_justice.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12&#8211;13 implies that the wicked might sometimes prosper; how does that align with other biblical promises of divine justice?

The latter part of the verse states the faith which the writer holds in spite of apparent contrary experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though a sinner do evil a hundred times</span>. The sentence begins again, as ver. 11, with <span class="accented">asher</span>, followed by a participle; and the conjunction ought to be rendered "because," the statement made in the former verse being resumed and strengthened. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">attamen</span>, which our version follows. The Septuagint goes astray, translating, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "He that has sinned has done evil from that time." The sinner is here supposed to have transgressed continually without cheek or punishment. The expression, "a hundred times," is used indefinitely, as <a href="/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And his days be prolonged</span>; better, <span class="accented">prolongeth his days for it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the practice of evil, with a kind of contentment and satisfaction, the pronoun being the ethic dative. Contrary to the usual course of temporal retribution, the sinner often lives to old age The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Et per patientiam sustentatur</span>, which signifies that he is kept in life by God's long-suffering. Ginsburg gives, "and is perpetuated," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his progeny - which is a possible, but not a probable, rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Yet surely I know</span>; rather, <span class="accented">though I for my part know</span>. He has seen sinners prosper; this experience has been forced upon him; yet he holds an inward conviction that God's moral government will vindicate itself at some time and in some signal manner. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</span> This is not really tautological; it is compared to St. Paul's expression (<a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>), "widows that are widows indeed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), implying that they are, in fact and life, what they profess to be. Delitzsch and Plumptre suggest that in Koheleth's time "God-fearers" had become the name of a religious class, as the <span class="accented">Chasidim</span>, or "Assideaus," in I Macc. 2:42; 7:13, etc. Certainly a trace of this so-named party is seen in <a href="/psalms/118-4.htm">Psalm 118:4</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>. When this adjustment of anomalies shall take place, whether in this life or in another, the writer says not here. In spite of all contrary appearances, he holds firm to his faith that it will be welt with the righteous in the long run. The comfort and peace of a conscience at rest, and the inward feeling that his life was ordered after God's will, would compensate a good man for much outward trouble; and if to this was added the assured hope of another life, it might indeed be said that it was well with him. The Septuagint has, "that they may fear before him," which implies that the mercy and loving-kindness of God, manifested in his care of the righteous, lead to piety and true religion. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon'), combining this verse with the next, produces a sense which is certainly not in the present Hebrew text, "For I know that it ever happens that a sinner does evil for a long time, and yet lives long, whilst he who fears before God is short-lived as a shadow." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Although</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a sinner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1496;&#1462;&#1431;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7789;e)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">evil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1435;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a hundred [times]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and still lives long,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;ma&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
