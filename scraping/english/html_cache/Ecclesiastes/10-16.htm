It signifies a deep sorrow or distress that is about to befall a nation or people. In the biblical context, this warning is directed towards a land or nation that is under poor leadership. The use of "land" here can be understood as a reference to a nation or kingdom, emphasizing the collective impact of leadership on the people. This phrase echoes the prophetic warnings found in other parts of the Bible, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, where nations are warned of the consequences of their leaders' actions.<p><b>whose king is a youth</b><br>The reference to a "youth" as a king suggests inexperience and immaturity in leadership. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, wisdom and experience were highly valued in rulers. A young king might lack the necessary discernment and understanding to govern effectively. This phrase can be connected to the story of Rehoboam, Solomon's son, who ascended to the throne at a young age and made unwise decisions that led to the division of the kingdom (1 Kings 12). The warning here is against the dangers of having leaders who are not yet ready to bear the responsibilities of governance.<p><b>and whose princes feast in the morning</b><br>Feasting in the morning implies indulgence and a lack of discipline among the leaders. In biblical times, morning was typically a time for work and preparation, not for feasting and revelry. This behavior indicates a disregard for duty and a focus on personal pleasure rather than the welfare of the nation. The contrast is seen in the example of Jesus Christ, who exemplified servant leadership and self-discipline. The behavior of these princes can be seen as a type of the prodigal lifestyle warned against in Proverbs, where wisdom is contrasted with folly. The indulgence of the leaders can lead to the downfall of the nation, as seen in the history of Israel and Judah when leaders turned away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Represents a nation or community under governance.

"Child" is <span class="accented">naar</span>, which term included any age up to manhood. Some interpret the word here, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek, in the sense of "slave," contrasting it with "the son of nobles" in the following verse. But it can hardly signify more than servitor, attendant; and in ver. 7 the antithesis to "prince" is <span class="accented">ebed</span>, not <span class="accented">naar</span>. The child in the present case is a youthful, inexperienced ruler, who does not realize his responsibilities, and is the tool of evil advisers. What particular instance, if any, Koheleth had in view it is impossible to say. Of course, many expositors see a reference to Rehoboam. whom, at forty years of age, his own son Abijah calls <span class="accented">naar</span> (<a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>), and who was certainly childish in his conduct (<a href="/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-14</a>). Hitzig connects the passage with the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who was but five years old at the death of his father, <span class="date">B.C. 205</span>, the reins of government being assumed by Agathocles and his sister Agathoclea, who occasioned serious disasters to the laud. To support this opinion, the date of our book has to be considerably reduced (see Introduction). It is best to take the gnome as a general expression, like that in <a href="/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>, "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them." <span class="cmt_word">Thy princes eat in the morning.</span> Eating here implies feasting and banqueting, beginning the day with sensual enjoyment instead of such honest work as attending to state matters, administering justice, etc., as becomes good rulers. None but profligates would thus spend the early morning. "These are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day," says St. Peter, repudiating the charge of intoxication (<a href="/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>). "Woe unto them," cries Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), "that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink!" Even the heathen censured such debauchery. Cicero thus abuses Antonius: "At quam multos dies in ea villa turpissime es per-bacchatus. Ab hora tertia bibebatur, ludebatur, vomebatur" ('Philipp.,' 2:41).
