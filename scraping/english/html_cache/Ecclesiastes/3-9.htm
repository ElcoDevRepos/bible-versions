The Preacher, traditionally understood to be Solomon, questions the ultimate benefit of labor and effort under the sun. This echoes the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which often highlights the transient nature of earthly pursuits.<p><b>What does the worker gain</b><br>The term "gain" here refers to profit or advantage. In the context of ancient Israel, labor was primarily agricultural or related to craftsmanship. The question challenges the reader to consider the lasting value of their work. This theme is consistent with other wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, which often contrasts the temporary rewards of earthly labor with the eternal rewards of righteousness and wisdom.<p><b>from his toil?</b><br>"Toil" suggests hard labor and effort, often with a sense of weariness. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, work was a necessary part of life, but it was also seen as a result of the Fall (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative that human labor, while necessary, is ultimately subject to the curse of sin. The question invites reflection on the eternal perspective, as seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to work for treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>) and to do everything for the glory of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.
