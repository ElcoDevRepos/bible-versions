In the context of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher (traditionally understood as Solomon) grapples with the meaning of life and the pursuit of what is truly beneficial. This echoes the wisdom literature's emphasis on the limits of human knowledge, as seen in <a href="/job/28-12.htm">Job 28:12-28</a>, where the search for wisdom is likened to mining for precious metals, ultimately concluding that only God knows the way to wisdom.<p><b>during the few days</b><br>The brevity of life is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the transient nature of human existence. <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> speaks of the days of our lives being seventy or eighty years, yet they quickly pass. This perspective encourages a focus on eternal values rather than temporary pleasures, aligning with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven.<p><b>in which he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow?</b><br>The imagery of life as a shadow underscores its ephemeral nature. Shadows are insubstantial and temporary, much like human life. This metaphor is also found in <a href="/job/8-9.htm">Job 8:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/144-4.htm">Psalm 144:4</a>, reinforcing the idea that life is brief and uncertain. The fleeting nature of life calls for a reliance on God's eternal wisdom rather than human understanding.<p><b>Who can tell a man what will come after him</b><br>This question highlights the uncertainty of the future and the limitations of human foresight. In the ancient Near Eastern context, divination and seeking omens were common practices to predict the future, yet the Bible consistently points to God as the only one who knows the future (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). This reliance on divine knowledge is a call to trust in God's sovereignty over the unknown.<p><b>under the sun?</b><br>The phrase "under the sun" is a key motif in Ecclesiastes, referring to the earthly, temporal realm as opposed to the divine, eternal perspective. It suggests a life lived without reference to God, characterized by vanity and meaninglessness. This perspective is contrasted with the New Testament teaching in <a href="/colossians/3.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>, which encourages believers to set their minds on things above, not on earthly things, thus finding true purpose and fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings. His reflections in Ecclesiastes often explore the meaning and purpose of life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation over which Solomon reigned. The cultural and religious context of Israel during Solomon's time influences the themes of Ecclesiastes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/life_under_the_sun.htm">Life under the sun</a></b><br>- A recurring phrase in Ecclesiastes, it refers to the earthly, temporal existence of humanity, often highlighting the limitations and futility of life without divine perspective.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_brevity_of_life.htm">The Brevity of Life</a></b><br>Life is described as a "shadow," emphasizing its transient and fleeting nature.

Plainly, the Divine prescience of vers. 10, 11 is closely connected with the question of man's ultimate good and his ignorance of the future, enunciated in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</span> Such discussions are profitless, for man knows not what is his real good - whether pleasure, apathy, or virtue, as philosophers would put it. To decide such questions he must be able to foresee results, which is denied him. The interrogative "Who knows?" is equivalent to an emphatic negative, as <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>, and is a common rhetorical form which surely need not be attributed to Pyrrhonism (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow.</span> These words amplify and explain the term "in life" of the preceding clause. They may be rendered literally, <span class="accented">During the number of the days of the life</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) <span class="accented">of his vanity</span>, <span class="accented">and he passeth them as a shadow</span>. A life of vanity is one that yields no good result, full of empty aims, unsatisfied wishes, unfulfilled purposes. It is the man who is here compared to the shadow, not his life. So <a href="/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, "He fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not," He soon passes away, and leaves no trace behind him. The thought is common. "Ye [Revised Version] are a vapor," says St. James (James 4:14), "that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."
