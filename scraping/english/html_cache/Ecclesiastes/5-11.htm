In the ancient Near Eastern context, prosperity was often seen as a sign of divine favor. However, the Preacher (traditionally understood as Solomon) frequently questions the ultimate value of material wealth. The increase of "good things" can also be seen as a test of character, as wealth can lead to pride or a false sense of security, as warned in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>.<p><b>so do those who consume them;</b><br>This part highlights the inevitable increase in dependents and responsibilities that accompany wealth. In ancient times, a wealthy individual would attract servants, workers, and even opportunists seeking to benefit from their prosperity. This reflects the cultural reality of patronage systems in the ancient world, where wealth was often shared within a community, but also exploited. The New Testament echoes this sentiment in <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>, where the rich are warned about the consequences of hoarding wealth.<p><b>what then is the profit to the owner,</b><br>Here, the Preacher questions the true benefit of wealth. Despite the increase in material goods, the owner may not experience personal gain or satisfaction. This rhetorical question challenges the reader to consider the fleeting nature of earthly possessions. Jesus addresses a similar theme in <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, questioning the value of gaining the world at the cost of one's soul.<p><b>except to behold them with his eyes?</b><br>The conclusion of the verse suggests that the only tangible benefit of wealth is the ability to see it, emphasizing its temporary and superficial nature. This aligns with the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which often points to the vanity of earthly pursuits. The idea of merely "beholding" wealth can be seen as a type of Jesus Christ, who taught that true treasure is found in heaven, not on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The Preacher's observation serves as a reminder of the limitations of material wealth and the importance of seeking eternal values.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation over which Solomon reigned, experiencing prosperity and peace during his rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consumers.htm">Consumers</a></b><br>- Refers to those who partake in the increased goods, highlighting the societal dynamics of wealth distribution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/owner.htm">Owner</a></b><br>- The individual who possesses wealth or goods, facing the challenge of finding true satisfaction in material abundance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_satisfaction_in_wealth.htm">The Illusion of Satisfaction in Wealth</a></b><br>Material abundance often attracts more consumers, leading to increased demands and responsibilities.

Scripture calls us to gratitude for God&#8217;s provision, responsible stewardship, generous sharing, and an eternal focus that values treasures in heaven over trophies on earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Koheleth proceeds to notice some of the inconveniences which accompany wealth, which go far to prove that God is over all. <span class="cmt_word">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them.</span> The more riches a man possesses, the greater are the claims upon him. He increases his household, retainers, and dependents, and is really none the better off for all his wealth. So Job in his prosperous days is said to have had "a very great household" (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), and the servants and laborers employed by Solomon must have taxed to the utmost even his abnormal resources (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>, etc.). Commentators from Piueda downwards have quoted the remarkable parallel in Xenoph., 'Cyropaed.,' 8:3, wherein the wealthy Persian Pheraulas, who had risen from poverty to high estate, disabuses a young Sacian friend of the idea that his riches made him happier or afforded supreme content. "Do you not know," said he," that I neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep with any more pleasure now than I did when I was poor? by having this abundance I gain merely this, that I have to guard more, to distribute more among others, and to have the trouble of taking care of more. For now numerous domestics demand of me food, drink, clothes; some want the doctor; one comes and brings me sheep that have been torn by wolves, or oxen killed by failing down a precipice, or tells of a murrain that has affected the cattle; so that I seem to myself to have more afflictions in my abundance than I had when I was poor,... It is obligatory on him who possesses much to expend much both on the gods and on friends and on strangers; and whosoever is greatly pleased with the possession of riches will, you may be assured, be greatly annoyed at the expenditure of them." <span class="cmt_word">What good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</span> What it is that the owners behold is doubtful. Ginsburg considers that the increased number of devourers is meant; but surely this sight could hardly be called <span class="accented">kishron</span>, "success, profit." So it is better to take the sight to be the amassed wealth. The contemplation of this is the only enjoyment that the possessor realizes. So the Vulgate, Et <span class="accented">quid prodest possessori</span>, <span class="accented">nisi quod cernit divitias oculis suis?</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>," And in what does the excellence of the owner consist? except the power of seeing it with his eyes."
