In the biblical context, it emphasizes the sovereignty and omnipotence of God, reminding believers to acknowledge His ultimate authority over all things. The word "consider" suggests a deep, thoughtful examination, encouraging believers to recognize God's hand in the world around them. This aligns with passages like <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which speaks of the heavens declaring the glory of God, and <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, which notes that God's invisible qualities are evident in creation.<p><b>Who can straighten:</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores human limitations in altering God's designs. It reflects the biblical theme of human humility before divine will, as seen in <a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>, where Job acknowledges that no purpose of God can be thwarted. The imagery of "straightening" suggests attempting to change or correct something perceived as crooked or bent, which in this context, symbolizes the futility of resisting God's plans.<p><b>what He has bent?</b><br>The phrase "what He has bent" implies that God has intentionally shaped or altered something for His purposes. This can be understood as God's providence in allowing certain circumstances or challenges. It echoes <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, where the clay questions the potter's work, highlighting the absurdity of questioning God's intentions. Theologically, it points to the belief that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>) and that His purposes, even when mysterious or difficult, are ultimately for good, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. Ecclesiastes is part of the wisdom literature in the Bible.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>- The nation to which Solomon belonged and over which he reigned as king.

Scripture repeatedly urges this kind of deliberate reflection: &#8220;Stand still and consider the wonders of God&#8221; (<a href="/job/37-14.htm">Job 37:14</a>); &#8220;Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/111-2.htm">Psalm 111:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Reflection cultivates awe. When we rehearse His acts in creation, redemption, and providence, we see that &#8220;His way is perfect&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-31.htm">2 Samuel 22:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Reflection also breeds trust. If His work in the past has been flawless, His present ordering of our lives is equally flawless (<a href="/psalms/92-5.htm">Psalm 92:5</a>; <a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who can straighten</b><p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical: no one can. Humanity is not sovereign; God is. Isaiah speaks the same truth: &#8220;Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker&#8230;Does the clay say to the potter, &#8216;What are you making?&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Our limitations are a grace. Knowing we cannot alter His decrees frees us from futile striving and calls us into restful submission (<a href="/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28&#8211;30</a>).<p>&#8226; Attempts to &#8220;straighten&#8221; what God has arranged only deepen frustration. Solomon earlier noted, &#8220;What is crooked cannot be straightened&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>). The wise accept God&#8217;s ordering rather than resist it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what He has bent?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Bent&#8221; (or &#8220;crooked&#8221;) describes situations that feel perplexing, painful, or contrary to our plans&#8212;illness, loss, unanswered prayer. Yet the text insists God has purposefully allowed them (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By shaping life with both &#8220;straight&#8221; and &#8220;bent&#8221; paths, the Lord cultivates character. Trials test faith &#8220;so that it may be proved genuine&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>); discipline yields &#8220;the peaceful fruit of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Acceptance is not fatalism but faith. Trust looks at the crooked path and confesses, &#8220;You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a> challenges us to step back, study God&#8217;s works, and bow to His sovereign craftsmanship. Because no one can straighten what He has bent, wisdom chooses reverent reflection, humble surrender, and confident trust that every &#8220;bent&#8221; thread in the tapestry is woven by a loving and perfect Hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider the work of God</span>. Here is another reason against murmuring and hasty judgment. True wisdom is shown by submission to the inevitable. In all that happens one ought to recognize God's work and God's ordering, and man's impotence. <span class="cmt_word">For who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</span> The things which God hath made crooked are the anomalies, the crosses, the difficulties, which meet us in life. Some would include bodily deformities, which seems to be a piece of unnecessary literalism.

The thought goes back to what was said in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>, "That which is crooked cannot be made straight;" and in <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, man "cannot contend with him that is mightier than he." "As for the wondrous works of the Lord," says Ben-Sirs," there may be nothing taken from them, neither may anything be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out" (Ecclus. 18:6). We cannot arrange events according to our wishes or expectations; therefore not only is placid acquiescence a necessary duty, but the wise man will endeavor to accommodate himself to existing circumstances <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Consider</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the work</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4639.htm">Strong's 4639: </a> </span><span class="str2">An action, a transaction, activity, a product, property</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of God:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#7733;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3201.htm">Strong's 3201: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be able, have power</span><br /><br /><span class="word">straighten</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7791;aq&#183;q&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8626.htm">Strong's 8626: </a> </span><span class="str2">To equalize, straighten, to compose</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He has bent?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;iw&#183;w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5791.htm">Strong's 5791: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bent or crooked</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 7:13 Consider the work of God for who (Ecclesiast.
