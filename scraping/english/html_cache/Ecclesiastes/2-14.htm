In biblical literature, "eyes" often symbolize insight and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12</a>). The wise man is portrayed as someone who can see and understand the world around him, making informed decisions. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that wisdom is a gift from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>) and is to be sought after diligently (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>).<p><b>but the fool walks in darkness</b><br>Darkness in scripture often represents ignorance, sin, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). The fool, lacking wisdom, is depicted as someone who stumbles through life without understanding or direction. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that contrast the paths of the wise and the foolish (<a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>). The fool's lack of insight leads to poor choices and ultimately, spiritual peril.<p><b>Yet I also came to realize that one fate overcomes them both</b><br>This phrase reflects the theme of mortality and the inevitability of death, a central concern in Ecclesiastes. Despite the differences in their paths, both the wise and the foolish share the same ultimate fate: death (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This realization underscores the book's exploration of life's fleeting nature and the vanity of earthly pursuits. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>, where both the wise and the foolish perish, leaving their wealth to others. This serves as a reminder of the need for a perspective that values eternal over temporal things, pointing to the hope found in Christ's resurrection and the promise of eternal life (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54-57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

The wise man has the eyes of his heart or understanding enlightened (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>); he looks into the nature of things, fixes his regard on what is most important, sees where to go; while the fool's eyes are in the ends of the earth (<a href="/proverbs/17-24.htm">Proverbs 17:24</a>); he walks on still in darkness, stumbling as he goes, knowing not whither his road shall take him. <span class="cmt_word">And I myself also</span> (<span class="accented">I even I</span>) <span class="cmt_word">perceived that one event happeneth to them all.</span> "Event" (<span class="accented">mikreh</span>); <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">interitus</span> (Vulgate); not chance, But death, the final event. The word is translated "hap" in <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>, and "chance" in <a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>; but the connection here points to a definite termination; nor would it be consistent with Koheleth's religion to refer this termination to fate or accident. With all his experience, he could only conclude that in one important aspect the observed superiority of wisdom to folly was illusory and vain. He saw with his own eyes, and needed no instructor to teach, that both wise and fool must succumb to death, the universal leveler.
