The acknowledgment of human limitations in predicting future events is consistent with the wisdom literature of the Bible, which often contrasts human understanding with divine omniscience. In the ancient Near Eastern context, people often sought guidance from diviners or omens, but the Bible consistently teaches reliance on God rather than human foresight (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>). This phrase underscores the futility of trying to control or predict life&#8217;s outcomes, echoing the sentiment found in <a href="/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-15</a>, where believers are reminded to submit their plans to the will of God.<p><b>who can tell him what is to come?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the inability of humans to foresee the future, reinforcing the need for trust in God&#8217;s sovereign plan. The phrase suggests that only God, who is outside of time, knows the end from the beginning (<a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>). In the broader biblical narrative, this points to the prophetic tradition where God reveals future events through His prophets, yet even they only know what God chooses to disclose (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, with Jesus Christ being the ultimate revelation of God&#8217;s plan for humanity (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). This phrase invites reflection on the nature of faith, encouraging believers to live with humility and dependence on God&#8217;s wisdom rather than their own understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Just as <a href="/proverbs/27-1.htm">Proverbs 27:1</a> cautions, &#8220;Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring,&#8221; we live with a built-in limitation.<p>- This limitation is not accidental; it keeps us dependent on the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) and humble before Him (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> &#8211; 15).<p>- The statement is literal: none of us can predict even the next heartbeat with certainty. Storms, surprises, and shifting circumstances all testify that &#8220;time and chance happen to them all&#8221; (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>).<p>- Because we cannot foresee outcomes, Scripture directs us to walk by faith rather than sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>) and to seek first God&#8217;s kingdom while trusting Him with the unknowns (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who can tell him what is to come?</b><p>- The rhetorical question expects the answer &#8220;No mere human.&#8221; Only the Lord &#8220;declares the end from the beginning&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>).<p>- This underscores our need for divine revelation.
