Solomon, known for his God-given wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), seeks to understand not only wisdom but also its opposites. This reflects a comprehensive approach to understanding life, echoing the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The pursuit of wisdom is a central theme in the wisdom literature of the Bible, including Proverbs and Job. The mention of "madness and folly" suggests an exploration of human behavior and the limits of human understanding, acknowledging the complexity and often contradictory nature of human life.<p><b>I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.</b><br>The phrase "pursuit of the wind" is a metaphor for the futility and elusiveness of human endeavors apart from God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wind symbolizes something that cannot be grasped or controlled, highlighting the transient and often meaningless nature of human efforts. This conclusion aligns with the broader message of Ecclesiastes, which frequently emphasizes the vanity of life under the sun (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>). The pursuit of wisdom, when detached from divine revelation, is ultimately unsatisfying and unfulfilling. This insight foreshadows the New Testament teaching that true wisdom is found in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), who embodies the wisdom of God and offers eternal significance beyond the temporal pursuits of this world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

(<a href="/proverbs/23-12.htm">Proverbs 23:12</a>) and to &#8220;ask for wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores personal responsibility: truth is available, but we must seek it (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to know wisdom</b><p>&#8226; Wisdom here reflects the skill of living in harmony with God&#8217;s revealed order (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon, already renowned for God-given wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>), wants deeper understanding&#8212;showing that even the wise must keep learning (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226;

Taking the text as it stands, it means to know wisdom and knowledge fully by a study of their contraries. The word for "madness" is peculiar to this book, but the corresponding verb occurs frequently in other books.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I gave my heart</span>. He reiterates the expression in order to emphasize his earnestness and energy in the pursuit of wisdom. And knowing, as St. Jerome says, that "contrariis contraria inteiliguntur," he studies the opposite of wisdom, and learns the truth by contrasting it with error. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">to know madness and folly</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>). The former word, <span class="accented">holeloth</span> (intensive plural), by its etymology points to a confusion of thought, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an unwisdom which deranges all ideas of order and propriety; and folly (hero <span class="accented">sikluth</span>), throughout the sapiential books, is identified with vice and wickedness, the contradictory of practical godliness. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "parables and knowledge," and some editors have altered the Hebrew text in accordance with this version, which they consider more suitable to the context. But Koheleth's standpoint is quite consistent. To use the words of St. Jerome in his 'Commentary,' "AEqualis studii fuit Salomoni, scire sapientiam et scientiam, et e regione errores et stultitiam, ut in aliis appetendis et aliis declinandis vera ejus sapientia probaretur." On the other hand, Den-Sirs gives a much-needed warning against touching pitch (Ecclus. 13:1), and argues expressly that "the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom" (Ecclus. 19:22). Plumptre unnecessarily sees in the use of the term" madness 'an echo of the teaching of the Stoics, who regarded men's weaknesses as forms of insanity. The moralist had no need to travel beyond his own experience in order to learn that sin was the acme of unwisdom, a declension from reason which might well be called madness. The subject is handled by Cicero, 'Tusc. Disput.,' 3:4, 5. We are reminded of Horace's expression ('Carm.,' 2:7. 27) - <p><span class="foreign">"Recepto Dulce mihi furere est amico."</span> And Anacreon's (31.), <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Thus far we have had Koheleth's secret thoughts - what he communed with his own heart (ver. 16). The result of his studies was most unsatisfying <span class="cmt_word">I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit</span>; or, <span class="accented">a striving after wind</span>, as ver. 14 Though the word is somewhat different. As such labor is wasted, for man cannot control issues. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;et&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
