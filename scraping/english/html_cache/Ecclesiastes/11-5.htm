In biblical times, wind was often seen as a mysterious and uncontrollable force, symbolizing the Spirit of God (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). The unpredictability of the wind serves as a metaphor for the divine mysteries that are beyond human comprehension. The Hebrew word for "wind" (ruach) is also used for "spirit," indicating a connection between the physical and spiritual realms.<p><b>or how the bones are formed in a mother&#8217;s womb</b><br>This reflects the ancient understanding of the mystery of life and creation. The formation of bones in the womb is a process that remains largely hidden and miraculous, even with modern scientific advancements. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, where the psalmist marvels at being "knit together" in the womb, acknowledging God's intimate involvement in creation. The reference to bones signifies the complexity and intricacy of human life, which is crafted by God.<p><b>so you cannot understand the work of God</b><br>This statement emphasizes the limitations of human wisdom in grasping the full scope of God's actions and purposes. It echoes the theme of divine sovereignty found throughout Ecclesiastes and other wisdom literature, such as <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God questions Job about the mysteries of creation. The inability to understand God's work calls for humility and trust in His divine plan.<p><b>the Maker of all things</b><br>This phrase affirms God's role as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It connects to <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is introduced as the Creator of the heavens and the earth. The title "Maker" underscores God's authority and power over all creation, reinforcing the idea that His ways and purposes are beyond human understanding. This also points to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the agent of creation (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's creative work through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

We may study His creation, but we ultimately trust the Maker whose work surpasses our sight and secures our faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The wording of this passage leaves it ambiguous whether we have here two illustrations of man's ignorance, or only one; whether we are to understand the verse as declaring that we know neither the way of the wind nor the growth of the embryo, or whether, retaining the translation "spirit," we take the whole verse as relating to the latter subject. (Comp. <a href="/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>.) The word for "her that is with child" occurs in that sense here only in the Old Testament, and in later Hebrew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit.</span> In this verse are presented one or two examples of man's ignorance of natural facts and processes as analogous to the mysteries of God's moral government. The word translated "spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) may mean also "wind," and is so taken here by many commentators (see <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; and comp. <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). In this view there would be two instances given, viz. the wind and the embryo. Certainly, the mention of the wind seems to come naturally after what has preceded; and man's ignorance of its way, and powerlessness to control it, are emblematic of his attitude towards Divine providence. The versions, however, seem to support the rendering of the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint (which connects the clause with ver. 4), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> ("among whom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who watch the weather), "There is none that knoweth what is the way of the spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate. <span class="accented">Quomodo ignoras quae sit via spiritus</span>. If we take this view, we have only one idea in the verse, and that is the infusion of the breath of life in the embryo, and its growth in its mother's womb. <span class="cmt_word">Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child</span>. Our version, by its insertions, has made two facts out of the statement in the Hebrew, which is literally, <span class="accented">holy the bones</span> (are) <span class="accented">in the womb of a pregnant woman</span>. Septuagint, "As (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>) bones are in the womb," etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qua ratione compingantur ossa in ventre praegnantis, "</span> And in what way the bones are framed in the womb of the pregnant." The formation and quickening of the foetus were always regarded as mysterious and inscrutable (comp. <a href="/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8, 9</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>; Wisd. 7:1, etc.). Wright compares M. Aurelius, 10:26, "The first principles of life are extremely slender and mysterious; and yet nature works them up into a strange increase of bulk, diversity, and proportion." Controversies concerning the origin of the soul have been rife from early times, some holding what is called Traducianism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that soul and body are both derived by propagation from earthly parents; others supporting Creationism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul, created specially by God, is infused into the child before birth. St. Augustine confesses ('Op. Imperf.,' 4:104) that he is unable to determine the truth of either opinion. And, indeed, this is one of those secret things which Holy Scripture has not decided for us, and about which no authoritative sentence has been given. The term "bones" is used for the whole conformation of the body (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>); <span class="accented">meleah</span>, "pregnant," means literally, "full," and is used like the Latin <span class="accented">plena</span> can here and nowhere else in the Old Testament, though common in later Hebrew. Thus Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:469 - <p><span class="foreign">"Plena patris thalamis excedit, et impia dire<br />Semina fert utero."</span> And 'Fast.,' 4:633 - <p><span class="foreign">"Nunc gravidum pecus est; gravidae sunt semine terrae<br />Telluri plenae victima plena datur."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span> Equally mysterious in its general scope and in its details is the working of God's providence. And as everything lies in God's hands, it must needs be secret and beyond human ken. This is why to "the works of God" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>) is added, "who maketh all." The God of nature is Lord of the future (comp. <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; Ecclus. 18:6); man must not disquiet himself about this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
