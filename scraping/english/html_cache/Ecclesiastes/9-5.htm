In biblical context, this awareness is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>, which encourages believers to "number our days" to gain wisdom. The acknowledgment of death serves as a reminder of the transient nature of life, urging individuals to live with purpose and in accordance with God's will. Historically, this understanding of mortality was prevalent in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where life was often seen as fleeting and uncertain.<p><b>but the dead know nothing</b><br>This statement reflects the belief that death brings an end to earthly knowledge and activity. In the Old Testament, Sheol is often depicted as a place of silence and inactivity (<a href="/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>). This view contrasts with the New Testament revelation of eternal life through Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the resurrection and the life. The phrase underscores the finality of death from an earthly perspective, emphasizing the importance of making decisions for God while alive.<p><b>They have no further reward</b><br>The concept of reward in this context refers to earthly achievements and recognition. Once a person dies, they can no longer partake in the rewards or pursuits of this world. This aligns with the teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where Jesus advises storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. The phrase serves as a caution against placing too much value on temporal rewards, encouraging a focus on eternal significance.<p><b>because the memory of them is forgotten</b><br>This phrase speaks to the fleeting nature of human legacy and remembrance. In ancient cultures, being remembered was often associated with honor and significance. However, Ecclesiastes points out the inevitability of being forgotten over time, as seen in <a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>, which compares human life to grass that withers. This serves as a humbling reminder of human limitations and the importance of seeking a lasting legacy through faithfulness to God, as exemplified by the enduring impact of Jesus Christ's life and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Once the body dies, the person no longer participates in earthly affairs; they &#8220;know nothing&#8221; of what happens here. <a href="/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a> affirms, &#8220;When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is not denial of conscious existence beyond the grave. Jesus portrays the rich man and Lazarus fully aware in the afterlife (<a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22-23</a>). The point is limited to earthly activity: the dead no longer make plans, earn income, or influence society.<p>&#8226; Job pictures this earthly disengagement vividly: &#8220;man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep&#8221; (<a href="/job/14-12.htm">Job 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, whatever is to be done for God and neighbor must be done while life lasts (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have no further reward</b><p>&#8226; Earth-bound rewards&#8212;wages, applause, promotions&#8212;cease at death. <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10-11</a> testifies that earthly rewards are fleeting and ultimately &#8220;meaningless.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus redirects attention to imperishable reward: &#8220;Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>).

Life is short, death is sure, earthly glory is passing&#8212;but for those who fear God, eternal reward and divine remembrance are guaranteed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the living know that they shall die</span>. This is added in confirmation of the statement in ver. 4. The living have at least the consciousness that they will soon have to die, and this leads them to work while it is day, to employ their faculties worthily, to make use of opportunities, to enjoy and profit by the present. They have a certain fixed event to which they must look forward; and they have not to stand idle, lamenting their fate, but their duty and their happiness is to accept the inevitable and make the best of it. <span class="cmt_word">But the dead know not anything</span>. They are cut off from the active, bustling world; their work is done; they have nothing to expect, nothing to labor for. What passes upon earth affects them not; the knowledge of it reaches them no longer. Aristotle's idea was that the dead did know something, in a hazy and indistinct way, of what went on in the upper world, and were in some slight degree influenced thereby, but not to such a degree as to change happiness into misery, or <span class="accented">vice versa</span> ('Eth. Nicom.,' 1:10 and 11). <span class="cmt_word">Neither have they any more a reward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no fruit for labor done. There is no question here about future retribution in another world. The gloomy view of the writer at this moment precludes all idea of such an adjustment of anomalies after death. <span class="cmt_word">For the memory of them is forgotten.</span> They have not even the poor reward of being remembered by loving posterity, which in the mind of an Oriental was an eminent blessing, to be much desired. There is a paronomasia in <span class="accented">zeker</span>, "memory," and <span class="accented">sakar</span>, "reward," which, as Plumptre suggests, may be approximately represented in English by the words "record" and "reward." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the living</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
