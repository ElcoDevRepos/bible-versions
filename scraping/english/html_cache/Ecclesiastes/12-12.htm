The use of "my son" is a common biblical expression of mentorship and guidance, seen in Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>) and other wisdom literature. It emphasizes the personal and relational aspect of imparting wisdom. The warning here is not just about the content of the books but the potential distraction from divine wisdom. This reflects the biblical theme of prioritizing spiritual understanding over worldly knowledge (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>There is no end to the making of many books,</b><br>In the ancient Near East, the production of books was a labor-intensive process, yet even then, the proliferation of writings was notable. This phrase highlights the endless pursuit of human knowledge and the constant production of literature. Historically, this can be connected to the vast libraries of the ancient world, such as the Library of Alexandria. Theologically, it underscores the futility of seeking ultimate truth outside of God's revelation. This aligns with the biblical perspective that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>and much study wearies the body.</b><br>This statement acknowledges the physical and mental toll that excessive study can take. In the context of Ecclesiastes, it reflects the broader theme of the limitations and burdens of human endeavors. The weariness mentioned here can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual exhaustion that comes from seeking fulfillment in human wisdom alone. This is consistent with the biblical teaching that rest and peace are found in God (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).

Besides all that has been said, take this additional and important caution, viz. what follows. The clause, however, has been differently interpreted, as if it said, "Do not attempt to go beyond the words of the sages mentioned above; or, "Be content with my counsels; they will suffice for your instruction." This seems to be the meaning of the Authorized Version. The personal address, "my son," so usual in the Book of Proverbs, is used by Koheleth in this place alone. It does not necessarily imply relationship (as if the pseudo-Solomon was appealing to Rehoboam), but rather the condition of pupil and learner, sitting at the feet of his teacher and friend. <span class="cmt_word">Of malting many books there is no end.</span> This could not be said in the time of the historical Solomon, even if we reckon his own voluminous works (<a href="/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32, 33</a>); for we know of no other writers of that date, and it is tolerably certain that none existed in Palestine. But we need not suppose that Koheleth is referring to extraneous heathen productions, of which, in our view, there is no evidence that he possessed any special knowledge. Doubtless many thinkers in his time had treated of the problems discussed in his volume in a far different manner from that herein employed, and it seemed good to utter a warning against the unprofitable reading of such productions. Juvenal speaks of the insatiable passion for writing in his day ('Sat.,' 7:51) - <p><span class="foreign">"Tenet insanabile multos<br />Scribendi cacoethes et aegro in corde senestit;"</span> <p>which Dryden renders - <p><span class="accented">"The charms of poetry our souls bewitch;<br />The curse of writing is an endless itch."</span> As in taking food it is not the quantity which a man eats, but what he digests and assimilates, that nourishes him, so in reading, the rule, <span class="accented">Non multa, sed multum</span>, must be observed; the gorging the literary appetite on food wholesome or not impedes the healthy mental process, and produces no intellectual growth or strength. The obvious lesson drawn by spiritual writers is that Christians should make God's Word their chief study, "turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called" (<a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>). For as St. Augustine says ('De Doctr. Christ.'), "Whereas in Holy Scripture you will find everything which has been profitably said elsewhere, to a far greater extent you will therein find what has been nowhere else enunciated, but which has been taught solely by the marvelous sublimity and the equally marvelous humility of the Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">Much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span> The two clauses in the latter part of the verse are co-ordinate. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("weariness") <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "study" (<span class="accented">lahag</span>) is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, nor in the Talmud, but the above meaning is sustained by its connection with an Arabic word signifying "to be eager for." The Vulgate (like the Septuagint) renders it <span class="accented">meditatio</span>. You may weary your brain, exhaust your strength, by protracted study or meditation on many books, but you will not necessarily thereby gain any insight into the problems of the universe or guidance for daily life. Marcus Aurelius dissuades from much reading: "Would you examine your whole composition?" he says; "pray, then let your library alone; what need you puzzle your thoughts and over-grasp yourself?" Again, "As for books, never be over-eager about them; such a fondness for reading will be apt to perplex your mind, and make you die unpleased" ('Medit.,' 2:2, 3, Collier). So Ben-Sira affirms, "The finding out of parables is a wearisome Labor of the mind" (Ecclus. 13:26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But beyond</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
