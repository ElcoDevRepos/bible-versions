They were occasions for community bonding and were typically marked by abundance and generosity. The Bible frequently references feasts as times of joy and fellowship, such as in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-23.htm">Luke 15:23-24</a>). Feasts in biblical times were not only about physical nourishment but also about emotional and spiritual refreshment, reflecting the communal aspect of life in Israelite society.<p><b>and wine makes life merry</b><br>Wine was a common beverage in biblical times, often associated with joy and celebration. It was a staple in the diet and used in religious ceremonies, symbolizing blessing and abundance. The Bible acknowledges the positive aspects of wine, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, which speaks of wine gladdening the heart. However, it also warns against excess and drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The dual nature of wine as both a gift and a potential stumbling block reflects the need for moderation and wisdom in its consumption.<p><b>but money is the answer for everything</b><br>This phrase reflects the practical realities of life, acknowledging the power and influence of wealth. In the ancient world, as today, money was necessary for meeting basic needs and facilitating trade and commerce. The Bible often addresses the role of money, warning against the love of it (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) and emphasizing the importance of using wealth wisely and justly. While money can solve many practical problems, the Bible also teaches that it cannot provide true fulfillment or salvation, which are found only in God (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the limitations of material wealth and the importance of prioritizing spiritual riches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The central place of worship and governance during Solomon's reign, often associated with the setting of his teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feasts.htm">Feasts</a></b><br>- Social and religious gatherings in ancient Israel, often involving food, drink, and celebration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wine.htm">Wine</a></b><br>- A common beverage in biblical times, symbolizing joy and festivity but also caution against excess.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/money.htm">Money</a></b><br>- Represents material wealth and its influence on human affairs, a recurring theme in wisdom literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temporary_nature_of_earthly_pleasures.htm">The Temporary Nature of Earthly Pleasures</a></b><br>Feasting and wine bring temporary joy, but they do not provide lasting fulfillment.

Here is a cause of the decay spoken of above. The rulers spend in revelry and debauchery the time and energy which they ought to give to affairs of state.

Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheer fullness of the mind" (Ecclus. 31.

It requires money to provide rich food and costly wines; this they possess, and they are thus able to indulge their appetites to the utmost.
