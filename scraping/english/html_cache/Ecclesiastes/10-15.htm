In biblical context, "fool" often refers to someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, particularly in spiritual matters. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction." The fool's toil is not just physical labor but also represents a life lived without divine guidance, leading to weariness and frustration. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual exhaustion that comes from pursuing worldly goals without seeking God's wisdom.<p><b>for he does not know the way to the city</b><br>In ancient times, cities were centers of safety, commerce, and community. Not knowing the way to the city implies a lack of direction and purpose. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual lostness, where the "city" represents the kingdom of God or a life aligned with divine purpose. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus says, "I am the way and the truth and the life," indicating that knowing the way to spiritual fulfillment is found in Him. The fool's ignorance of the way to the city underscores a life disconnected from God's guidance and wisdom, leading to aimless wandering and ultimate weariness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Ecclesiastes, the fool represents someone who lacks wisdom and understanding, often making poor decisions that lead to weariness and frustration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Symbolically, the city represents a place of safety, provision, and community.

Scripture esteems diligent work&#8212;&#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>)&#8212;yet here Solomon highlights labor that is fruitless. It pictures someone exerting himself but getting nowhere, a wheel spinning in mud. In <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> we read, &#8220;The soul of the diligent is fully satisfied,&#8221; implying that toil can be rewarding, but only when directed by wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of a fool</b><p>A &#8220;fool&#8221; in biblical terms isn&#8217;t merely an uninformed person; he actively rejects God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). <a href="/ecclesiastes/10-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:3</a> notes, &#8220;Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking.&#8221; His worldview is self-centered rather than God-centered, so his choices, priorities, and labor are fatally misaligned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wearies him</b><p>Because the fool&#8217;s work lacks godly purpose, it drains instead of fulfills. The weight of his own folly saps strength&#8212;think of <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a> where repeating mistakes is compared to a dog returning to its vomit. Effort minus wisdom equals exhaustion without progress, much like Israel&#8217;s idolatrous labor described in <a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>: &#8220;Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he does not know</b><p>Ignorance here is willful. <a href="/jeremiah/5-4.htm">Jeremiah 5:4</a> laments, &#8220;They are foolish, for they do not know the way of the LORD.&#8221; God continually offers light (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>), but the fool chooses darkness. His lack of knowledge is not due to God&#8217;s silence; it is the result of stubborn refusal to listen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the way to the city</b><p>In ancient times a city represented safety, community, and opportunity. Roads to a major city were obvious; missing them exposed a person&#8217;s sheer incompetence. Spiritually, <a href="/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a> reminds us, &#8220;For here we do not have a permanent city, but we are seeking the one to come.&#8221; The fool can&#8217;t even find the temporal city, let alone the eternal one. Contrast this with <a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>, which promises a clear &#8220;Way of Holiness&#8221; for the redeemed. Wisdom stands at the city gates calling (<a href="/proverbs/8-1.htm">Proverbs 8:1-3</a>), yet the fool remains lost outside.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15</a> paints a vivid warning: energy expended apart from God&#8217;s wisdom leads to exhaustion and failure. The fool&#8217;s problem isn&#8217;t lack of effort; it&#8217;s lack of direction. True fulfillment comes when labor is guided by the clear path God provides, leading not only to earthly fruitfulness but ultimately to the eternal city prepared for those who walk in His ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">To go to the city.</span>--Evidently a proverbial expression; "is not able to find his way on a plain road." (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm" title="And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.">Isaiah 35:8</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The labor of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city</span>. The transition from plural to singular is here made, <span class="accented">The work of fools wearieth him that knoweth not, etc</span>. "Fools' work" signifies, perhaps, the vain speculations about Providence which Koheleth constantly condemns; or at any rate, all vain and objectless toil and trouble. Not to know the way to the city is probably a proverbial saying expressive of gross ignorance concerning the most obvious matters. How should one, who fails in the knowledge open to all experience, be able to investigate and give an opinion about abstruse questions (comp. <a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>)? For the last clause other interpretations have been proposed, such as, the fool knows not how to transact public business (which is introducing a modern idea); the oppressed peasant knows not the way to the town where he might obtain redress; he is so foolish that he does not understand where he may find patrons whom he may bribe to plead his cause; he is an Essene, who avoids cities; he cannot make his way to the new Jerusalem, the city of God. But these artificial explanations are to be rejected, while the simple interpretation given above is plainly consistent with the context. The lesson is not to meddle with things too high, especially when you are ignorant of the commonest matters. A little wisdom would prevent endless and useless trouble. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The toil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;mal)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5999.htm">Strong's 5999: </a> </span><span class="str2">Toil, wearing effort, worry, wheth, of body, mind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#601;&#183;s&#238;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wearies him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;yag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#8216;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person feminine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3021.htm">Strong's 3021: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gasp, to be exhausted, to tire, to toil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1445;&#1499;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the city.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/10-15.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 10:15 The labor of fools wearies every one (Ecclesiast.
