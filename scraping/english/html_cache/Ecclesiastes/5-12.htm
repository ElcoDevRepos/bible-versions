In biblical times, work was often physically demanding, and a laborer's rest was well-earned. The Bible frequently emphasizes the value of hard work (<a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11, 14</a>:23). The sweetness of sleep here symbolizes the satisfaction and peace that come from fulfilling one's duties and living a life of integrity. This can be seen as a reflection of the divine order established in Genesis, where God Himself worked for six days and rested on the seventh (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>whether he eats little or much</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the idea that contentment is not dependent on material wealth or abundance. The worker's peace is not tied to the quantity of his possessions or food, but rather to the fulfillment of his labor. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, where He emphasizes that life is more than food and the body more than clothes (<a href="/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>). The Apostle Paul also speaks to this in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>, where he describes learning to be content in any circumstance.<p><b>but the abundance of the rich man permits him no sleep</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the rich man, whose wealth and possessions become a source of anxiety rather than comfort. This reflects the biblical theme that riches can be a burden and a distraction from spiritual well-being (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9-10</a>). The rich man's sleeplessness can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual unrest that comes from placing trust in material wealth rather than in God. Jesus' parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>) illustrates the futility of hoarding wealth without being "rich toward God." This phrase serves as a caution against the false security that wealth can provide, reminding believers to seek first the kingdom of God (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_laborer.htm">The Laborer</a></b><br>Represents the common worker who finds satisfaction and rest in honest labor, regardless of material wealth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_man.htm">The Rich Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who possess great wealth but are often burdened by the cares and anxieties that accompany it.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was a king known for his wisdom, wealth, and eventual realization of the vanity of earthly pursuits.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which Ecclesiastes was written, where wealth and labor were significant aspects of daily life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sleep.htm">Sleep</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to represent peace and contentment, contrasting the restlessness of those consumed by wealth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_in_simplicity.htm">Contentment in Simplicity</a></b><br>The verse highlights the peace found in a simple life, encouraging believers to find satisfaction in their daily work and trust in God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_burden_of_wealth.htm">The Burden of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can bring anxiety and restlessness, reminding Christians to evaluate their priorities and focus on eternal values rather than material accumulation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>The laborer's sweet sleep serves as a reminder to trust in God's provision, knowing that He cares for our needs regardless of our material circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_vanity_of_earthly_pursuits.htm">The Vanity of Earthly Pursuits</a></b><br>Solomon's reflection on wealth and restlessness serves as a caution against pursuing wealth at the expense of spiritual peace and contentment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_rest.htm">The Importance of Rest</a></b><br>Physical and spiritual rest are essential for well-being, and believers are encouraged to find rest in Christ, who offers true peace.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Ecclesiastes_5_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Ecclesiastes 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Eccl_5_12_Laborer_vs_rich_sleep.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 5:12 describe the sleep of a laborer versus the rich?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_contentment_and_wealth.htm">What does this verse teach about contentment and material wealth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Tim_6_6-10_to_Ecc_5_12_insights.htm">How can 1 Timothy 6:6-10 deepen our understanding of Ecclesiastes 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_nurture_daily_contentment.htm">In what ways can you cultivate contentment in your daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_trusting_God_on_peace_rest.htm">How does trusting God impact your peace and rest, according to Ecclesiastes 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Ecclesiastes_5_12_and_Christian_contentment.htm">How does Ecclesiastes 5:12 relate to the concept of contentment in Christian theology?

The Septuagint, with a different pointing, renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "slave," which is less appropriate, the fact being generally true of free or bond man. Whether his fare be plentiful or scanty, the honest laborer earns and enjoys his night's rest. <span class="cmt_word">But the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> The allusion is not to the overloading of the stomach, which might occasion sleeplessness in the case of the poor equally with the rich man, but to the cares and anxieties which wealth brings. "Not a soft couch, nor a bedstead overlaid with silver, nor the quietness that exists throughout the house, nor any other circumstance of this nature, are so generally wont to make sleep sweet and pleasant, as that of laboring, and growing weary, and lying down with a disposition to sleep, and very greatly needing it .... Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst lying on their beds, they are frequently without sleep through the whole night; and, though they devise many schemes, they do not obtain such pleasure" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. on Stat.,' 22). The contrast between the grateful sleep of the tired worker and the disturbed rest of the avaricious and moneyed and luxurious has formed a fruitful theme for poets.
