In the context of ancient Israel, marriage was a covenantal bond, reflecting God's design for companionship and mutual support (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-24</a>). The term "beloved" underscores the affection and commitment expected in marriage. The enjoyment of life with one's spouse is seen as a gift from God, aligning with the wisdom literature's broader theme of finding joy in the simple, God-given pleasures of life (<a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18-19</a>).<p><b>all the days of the fleeting life</b><br>The phrase "fleeting life" highlights the transient nature of human existence, a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes. This perspective encourages individuals to value and make the most of their time on earth. The brevity of life is a reminder of the urgency to live purposefully and joyfully, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>, which calls for wisdom in numbering our days.<p><b>that God has given you under the sun</b><br>This acknowledges God's sovereignty in granting life and its circumstances. "Under the sun" is a phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe earthly life, with its limitations and challenges. It serves as a reminder that while life is temporary and often perplexing, it is still a divine gift, and one should live in gratitude and obedience to God (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><b>all your fleeting days</b><br>Reiterating the transient nature of life, this phrase emphasizes the importance of consistently valuing one's relationships and experiences. The repetition underscores the urgency to live with intention and appreciation, as life is not only short but also unpredictable (<a href="/job/14.htm">Job 14:1-2</a>).<p><b>For this is your portion in life</b><br>The concept of "portion" suggests an allotted share or inheritance, indicating that enjoying life with one's spouse is part of God's intended blessing for individuals. This aligns with the biblical understanding that God provides for His people, and they are to find contentment in His provisions (<a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5-6</a>).<p><b>and in your labor under the sun</b><br>Work is portrayed as an integral part of life, ordained by God since creation (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). While Ecclesiastes often reflects on the futility of labor, this phrase suggests that finding satisfaction in one's work is also a divine gift. It encourages a balanced view of labor, recognizing it as both a responsibility and a source of fulfillment when approached with the right perspective (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_preacher.htm">The Preacher (Qoheleth)</a></b><br>- The voice in Ecclesiastes, often identified with Solomon, who reflects on the meaning of life and human endeavors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beloved_wife.htm">Beloved Wife</a></b><br>- Represents the intimate and personal relationships that bring joy and fulfillment in life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/under_the_sun.htm">Under the Sun</a></b><br>- A phrase used throughout Ecclesiastes to describe life on earth, emphasizing the temporal and often futile nature of worldly pursuits.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fleeting_life.htm">Fleeting Life</a></b><br>- The transient nature of human existence, highlighting the brevity and impermanence of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_gift_of_companionship.htm">The Gift of Companionship</a></b><br>Marriage is a divine gift meant to be enjoyed.

The article is omitted, as the maxim is to be taken generally.

(For the expression, " see life," <span class="accented">vide</span> note on Ecclesiastes 2:1.) St. Jerome's comment is misleading, "Quacumque tibi placuerit feminarum ejus gaude complexu."

The relative may refer to either the "wife" or" the days of life." The Septuagint and Vulgate take it as belonging to the latter, and this seems most suitable (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor</span>, etc. Such moderate enjoyment is the recompense allowed by God for the toil which accompanies a properly spent life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Enjoy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">life</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your beloved</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1463;&#1431;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;ha&#7687;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_157.htm">Strong's 157: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have affection f</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the fleeting</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#7687;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
