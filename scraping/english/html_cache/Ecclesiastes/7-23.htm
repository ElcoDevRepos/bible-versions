In the context of Ecclesiastes, "all this" refers to the observations and experiences of life&#8217;s vanities and the pursuit of meaning. The author, traditionally understood to be Solomon, is renowned for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). This testing by wisdom suggests a methodical and thoughtful approach, aligning with the biblical tradition of seeking understanding through divine insight (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The use of wisdom here is not merely intellectual but deeply spiritual, reflecting a desire to discern God&#8217;s purpose in the midst of life's enigmas.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I resolve to be wise.&#8221;</b><br>This resolution reflects a deliberate commitment to pursue wisdom, echoing Solomon&#8217;s own request for wisdom from God (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). The resolve to be wise is a noble pursuit, often encouraged in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>). However, the context of Ecclesiastes suggests a tension between human aspiration and divine reality. The cultural backdrop of ancient Israel placed high value on wisdom, often seen as a means to live righteously and in harmony with God&#8217;s will. Yet, the author acknowledges the limitations of human wisdom in fully comprehending God&#8217;s ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>But it was beyond me.</b><br>This admission of limitation underscores a central theme of Ecclesiastes: the futility of human efforts to grasp the full scope of divine wisdom. Despite Solomon&#8217;s unparalleled wisdom, he recognizes that true understanding is ultimately beyond human reach. This echoes Job&#8217;s realization of the limits of human knowledge in the face of God&#8217;s infinite wisdom (<a href="/job/42.htm">Job 42:1-6</a>). The phrase points to the humility required in acknowledging that some aspects of life and God&#8217;s plan remain mysterious. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Christ as the embodiment of divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), suggesting that ultimate wisdom is found not in human striving but in relationship with God through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Scripture applauds this kind of honest inquiry that still starts with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by wisdom</b><p>&#8226; The measuring stick was not public opinion but God-given wisdom. Solomon had asked for and received this gift (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom in the biblical sense is moral, practical, and rooted in reverence for God (<a href="/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>).<p>&#8226; His method reminds believers that the only reliable lens for evaluating life is the wisdom that &#8220;comes from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;I resolve to be wise.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This is the king&#8217;s determined goal. Like the father in Proverbs urging his son, &#8220;Get wisdom, get understanding&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>), Solomon sets his heart to grab hold of it.<p>&#8226; The resolve itself is commendable. God invites everyone to &#8220;ask, and it will be given&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the wording shows that determination alone cannot guarantee success if God does not grant deeper insight.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But it was beyond me.</b><p>&#8226; After all the experiments and effort, Solomon still hit a wall. Human wisdom, even at its best, is finite (<a href="/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Some realities remain &#8220;the secret things&#8221; that &#8220;belong to the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The apostle later echoes this awareness: &#8220;Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s confession humbles every believer, steering us to rely on the One &#8220;in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Solomon personally investigated every avenue of life, using the God-given wisdom he possessed. He firmly resolved to master wisdom, yet discovered that ultimate understanding still lay out of reach. The verse teaches that honest inquiry and firm resolve are vital, but final insight rests with God alone. True wisdom begins with fearing the Lord, seeks Him earnestly, and finally bows before His infinite, unsearchable mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) The confession of failure to attain speculative knowledge gives energy to the preacher's next following enunciation of the practical lesson which he <span class= "ital">has </span>learned from his experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-29.</span> - Section 4. Further in sight into essential wisdom was not obtain able; but Koheleth learned some other practical lessons, viz. <span class="accented">that wickedness was folly and madness</span>; <span class="accented">that woman was the most evil thing in the world</span>; <span class="accented">that man had perverted his nature</span>, <span class="accented">which was made originally good</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this have I proved by wisdom</span>; i.e. wisdom was the means by which he arrived at the practical conclusions given above (vers. 1-22). Would wisdom solve deeper questions? And if so, could he ever hope to attain it? <span class="cmt_word">I said, I will be wise</span>. This was his strong resolve. He desired to grow in wisdom, to use it in order to unfold mysteries and explain anomalies. Hitherto he had been content to watch the course of men's lives, and find by experience what was good and what was evil for them; now he craves for an insight into the secret laws that regulate those external circumstances: he wants a philosophy or theosophy. His desire is expressed by his imitator in the Book of Wisdom (9.), "O God of my fathers,... give me Wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne.... O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne of thy glory, that being present she may labor with me." <span class="cmt_word">But it was far from me.</span> It remained in the far distance, out of reach. Job's experience (28.) was his. Practical rules of life he might gain, and had mastered, but essential, absolute wisdom was beyond mortal grasp. Man's knowledge and capacity are limited. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2090.htm">Strong's 2090: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tested</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(nis&#183;s&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5254.htm">Strong's 5254: </a> </span><span class="str2">To test, to attempt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by wisdom, [saying],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
