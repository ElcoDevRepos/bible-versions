In the context of Ecclesiastes, this phrase highlights the efforts of King Solomon, traditionally considered the author, to create a self-sustaining and prosperous environment. Reservoirs were essential for agriculture in the arid climate of Israel, ensuring a steady water supply. This reflects Solomon's wisdom and ability to manage resources, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>, where his understanding of nature is emphasized.<p><b>to water my groves</b><br>The mention of groves indicates the cultivation of orchards or gardens, which were symbols of luxury and abundance in the ancient Near East. This aligns with the description of Solomon's wealth and grandeur in <a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-27</a>. The groves could include a variety of fruit trees, which were valuable for both sustenance and trade. The act of watering these groves signifies the maintenance and care required to sustain such prosperity, paralleling the spiritual care needed for one's soul, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where a righteous person is likened to a tree planted by streams of water.<p><b>of flourishing trees</b><br>Flourishing trees symbolize prosperity, growth, and life. In biblical literature, trees often represent stability and blessing, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>. The flourishing nature of these trees underlines the success of Solomon's endeavors and the blessings of God upon his reign. However, in the broader context of Ecclesiastes, this prosperity is ultimately seen as fleeting and unable to provide lasting fulfillment, echoing the book's theme of the vanity of earthly pursuits. This can be contrasted with the eternal life and fulfillment found in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true vine in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>, offering spiritual nourishment and growth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects, including the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Solomon reigned and undertook many of his building projects, including the reservoirs mentioned in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/reservoirs.htm">Reservoirs</a></b><br>These were large water storage systems that Solomon constructed to irrigate his gardens and groves, showcasing his wealth and the extent of his projects.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/groves_of_flourishing_trees.htm">Groves of Flourishing Trees</a></b><br>These represent the lush and abundant gardens that Solomon cultivated, symbolizing prosperity and the fruits of human labor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_ecclesiastes.htm">The Book of Ecclesiastes</a></b><br>A book of wisdom literature in the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to Solomon, exploring themes of meaning, purpose, and the vanity of worldly pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit_of_earthly_accomplishments.htm">The Pursuit of Earthly Accomplishments</a></b><br>Solomon's construction of reservoirs and gardens illustrates the human desire to achieve and create.

The place is probably the same as that called Etham by Josephus in his description of Solomon's luxury (<span class= "ital">Ant. viii.</span> 7. 3). Josephus speaks of another Pool of Solomon (<span class= "ital">Bell. Jud. </span>v. 4. 2). Tanks are necessary for irrigation in a land where natural streams are few and are dried up in summer. The king's pool is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/2-14.htm" title="Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.">Nehemiah 2:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pools of water</span>. Great care was exercised by Solomon to provide his capital with water, and vast operations were undertaken for this purpose. "The king's pool," mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/2-14.htm">Nehemiah 2:14</a>, may have been constructed by him (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04. 2); but the most celebrated work ascribed to him is the water-supply at Etham, southwest of Bethlehem, and the aqueduct leading from thence to Jerusalem. Most modern travelers have described these pools. They are three in number, and, according to Robinson's measurement, are of immense size. The first, to the east, is 582 feet long, 207 wide, and 50 deep; the second, 432 by 250, and 39 feet deep; the third, 380 by 236, and 25 feet deep. They are all, however, narrower at the upper end, and widen out gradually, flowing one into the other. There is a copious spring led into the uppermost pool from the north-east, but this supply is augmented by other sources now choked and ruined. The water from the pools was conveyed round the ridge on which Bethlehem stands in earthen pipes to Jerusalem. Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 326) says, "Near that city it was carried along the west side of the Valley of Gihon to the north-western end of the lower Pool of Gihon, where it crossed to the east side, and, winding round the southern declivity of Zion below <span class="accented">Neby Daud</span>, finally entered the south-eastern corner of the temple area, where the water was employed in the various services of the sanctuary." Etham is, with good reason, identified with the beautiful valley of Urtas, which lies southwest of Bethlehem, in the immediate neighborhood of the pools of Solomon. The fountain near the present village watered the gardens and orchards which were planted here, the terraced hills around were covered with vines, figs, and olives, and the prospect must have been delightful and refreshing in that thirsty land. <span class="cmt_word">To water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in order to irrigate a wood sprouting forth trees</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a nursery of saplings. So we read how the Garden of Eden was watered (<a href="/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) - a most necessary feature in Eastern countries, where streams and pools are not constructed for picturesque reasons, but for material uses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reservoirs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1295.htm">Strong's 1295: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pool, pond</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8248.htm">Strong's 8248: </a> </span><span class="str2">To quaff, to irrigate, furnish a, potion to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my groves</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3293.htm">Strong's 3293: </a> </span><span class="str2">A copse of bushes, a forest, honey in the comb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of flourishing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#234;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6779.htm">Strong's 6779: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sprout, spring up</span><br /><br /><span class="word">trees.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1510;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6086.htm">Strong's 6086: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tree, trees, wood</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">OT Poetry: Ecclesiastes 2:6 I made myself pools of water (Ecclesiast.
