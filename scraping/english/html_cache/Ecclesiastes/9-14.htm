In ancient times, cities were often small and fortified, with populations that could be easily overwhelmed by larger forces. The mention of "few men" highlights the city's lack of military strength and resources. This imagery can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God using the weak to confound the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>. The small city can also symbolize the remnant of Israel, often depicted as a minority in the face of overwhelming odds.<p><b>A mighty king came against it,</b><br>The "mighty king" represents a powerful adversary, often seen in the Old Testament as a figure of judgment or oppression. Historically, kings like Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon or Sennacherib of Assyria would have been familiar to the original audience as examples of such powerful rulers. This phrase underscores the inevitability of conflict and the reality of living in a fallen world where power dynamics often lead to oppression. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's kingdom over earthly powers, as prophesied in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<p><b>surrounded it,</b><br>The act of surrounding a city was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, known as a siege. This would cut off the city's supplies and force it into submission. The imagery of being surrounded can also be seen in <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12-13</a>, where David describes being encircled by enemies. Spiritually, this can represent the pressures and trials believers face, yet it also points to God's protection and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>.<p><b>and built large siege ramps against it.</b><br>Siege ramps were constructed to breach city walls, a method used by ancient armies to overcome fortified cities. Archaeological evidence, such as the siege ramp at Lachish, provides insight into the historical accuracy of such tactics. This phrase emphasizes the determination and resources of the attacking king. In a spiritual sense, it can symbolize the relentless attacks of the enemy against God's people. However, it also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the ultimate futility of human efforts against His will, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>.<div

9:14 Mean</div><b>There was a small city with few men</b><p>Solomon opens with a scene of vulnerability. A town so small that its fighting force can be counted on two hands sounds hopeless on paper, yet God has always delighted in working through the &#8220;few.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7</a> reminds Israel, &#8220;The LORD did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples, for you were the fewest.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jonathan told his armor-bearer, &#8220;For the LORD can save by many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus speaks of the narrow way that &#8220;only a few find&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-14.htm">Matthew 7:14</a>).<p>The literal picture of a tiny population highlights how, in God&#8217;s economy, strength is never measured by headcount but by His presence among the humble (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A mighty king came against it</b><p>Now the imbalance intensifies: &#8220;a great king,&#8221; wielding resources, reputation, and raw power, marches in. Scripture never minimizes very real earthly threats; it simply puts them in perspective.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> shows rulers who &#8220;take their stand against the LORD.&#8221; Earthly power often overestimates itself.<p>&#8226; Sennacherib boasted against Jerusalem in <a href="/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10&#8211;13</a>, yet one angel felled his army overnight (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a> looks ahead to kings who &#8220;will make war on the Lamb,&#8221; only to be conquered &#8220;because He is Lord of lords.&#8221;<p>Ecclesiastes presents the king as genuinely formidable, yet the verse quietly invites us to remember Who sets limits on every ruler&#8217;s reach (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surrounded it</b><p>The city is cut off. That picture taps into a universal feeling when trouble closes in from every side.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/118-10.htm">Psalm 118:10-12</a> describes enemies encircling &#8220;like bees,&#8221; yet the psalmist still triumphs &#8220;in the name of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s servant saw horses and chariots hemming in Dothan (<a href="/2_kings/6-14.htm">2 Kings 6:14</a>), but God opened his eyes to a greater, invisible army (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus foretold Jerusalem&#8217;s own encirclement (<a href="/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>), a sober prophecy fulfilled in A.D. 70.<p>Literal sieges symbolize spiritual pressure as well. Paul writes, &#8220;We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>), showing how the Lord sustains His people even when the squeeze is real.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And built large siege ramps against it</b><p>Siege ramps were engineering marvels&#8212;massive earthen slopes constructed to breach walls.

Solomon is teeing up the next verse, where a single wise man delivers the city. By spotlighting utter disparity, he magnifies the value of God-given wisdom over brute force, reminding us that no matter how small, surrounded, or strategically outmatched we may feel, the Lord delights in using the unlikely to confound the mighty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) Idle attempts have been made to find a historic reference in this passage. What is here told is so like the story (2 Samuel 20) of the deliverance of Abel-beth-Maachah by a wise woman, whose name, nevertheless, has not been preserved, that we cannot even be sure that the writer had any other real history in his mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was a little city</span>. The substantive verb is, as commonly, omitted. Commentators have amused themselves with endeavoring to identify the city here mentioned. Thus some see herein Athens, saved by the counsel of Themistocles, who was afterwards driven from Athens and died in misery (Justin., 2:12); or Dora, near Mount Carmel, besieged unsuccessfully by Antiochus the Great, <span class="date">B.C. 218</span>, though we know nothing of the circumstances (Polyb., 5:66); but see note on ver. 13. The Septuagint takes the whole paragraph hypothetically, "Suppose there was a little city," etc. Wright well compares the historical allusions to events fresh in the minds of his hearers made by our Lord in his parable of the pounds (<a href="/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12, 14, 15, 27</a>). So we may regard the present section as a parable founded on some historical fact well known at the time when the book was written. <span class="cmt_word">A great king</span>. The term points to some Persian or Assyrian potentate; or it may mean merely a powerful general (see <a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>; <a href="/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Built great bulwarks against it</span>.

What are meant are embankments or mounds raised high enough to overtop the walls of the town, and to command the positions of the besieged.
