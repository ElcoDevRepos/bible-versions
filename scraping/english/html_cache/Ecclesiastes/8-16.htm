The author, traditionally believed to be Solomon, is renowned for his wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-34</a>). The quest for understanding is a hallmark of biblical literature, echoing <a href="/proverbs/4-7.htm">Proverbs 4:7</a>, which emphasizes the importance of acquiring wisdom. The Hebrew concept of wisdom (&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;, chokmah) involves practical living and moral insight, not just intellectual knowledge.<p><b>and to observe the task that one performs on the earth&#8212;</b><br>This part highlights the Preacher's examination of human labor and endeavors. Ecclesiastes frequently addresses the futility and transient nature of earthly tasks (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3, 2</a>:11). The phrase suggests a comprehensive observation of human activity, reflecting the Preacher's attempt to discern meaning in life's work. This aligns with the Genesis mandate for humanity to work and steward the earth (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>), yet Ecclesiastes questions the ultimate value of such toil.<p><b>though his eyes do not see sleep in the day or even in the night&#8212;</b><br>This phrase indicates the relentless pursuit of understanding and the exhaustive nature of human labor. The lack of sleep symbolizes the ceaseless quest for meaning and the burdens of life (<a href="/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>). It also reflects the Preacher's personal experience of sleeplessness due to the weight of existential questions. This imagery connects to the broader biblical theme of rest, as seen in God's provision of Sabbath (<a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>), contrasting human restlessness with divine peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom. He reflects on the pursuit of wisdom and the observation of human activity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>Represents the realm of human activity and the stage on which the events of life unfold. It is the place where Solomon observes the ceaseless activity of mankind.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>A central theme in Ecclesiastes, wisdom is portrayed as a pursuit that can lead to understanding but also to the realization of life's complexities and limitations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_limitations_of_human_wisdom.htm">The Limitations of Human Wisdom</a></b><br>While wisdom is valuable, it has its limits. Human understanding cannot fully grasp the complexities of life or the purposes of God. This calls for humility and reliance on divine wisdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_ceaseless_activity.htm">The Futility of Ceaseless Activity</a></b><br>Solomon observes that human activity is relentless, yet often without ultimate purpose. This challenges us to evaluate our pursuits and ensure they align with God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_need_for_rest_and_trust_in_god.htm">The Need for Rest and Trust in God</a></b><br>The phrase "no sleep day or night" highlights the restlessness of human endeavors.

These two considerations conduce to the old conclusion, that man had best enjoy life, only being careful to use it energetically and well. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - No mortal wisdom, combined with the closest observation and thought, can fathom the mysteries of God's moral government. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I applied mine heart</span> (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>). The answering member of the sentence is in ver. 17, the last clause of the present verse being parenthetical. <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom</span>. This was his first study (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). He endeavored to acquire wisdom which might enable him to investigate God's doings. His second study was <span class="cmt_word">to see the business that is done upon the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only to learn what men do in their several stations and callings, but likewise to understand what all this means, what it tends to, its object and result. (For "business," <span class="accented">inyan</span>, see on Ecclesiastes 1:13.) The Vulgate here renders it <span class="accented">distentionem</span>, "distraction," which is like the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For also</span> there is that <span class="cmt_word">neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes</span>. This is a parenthetical clause expressing either the restless, unrelieved labor that goes on in the world, or the sleepless meditation of one who tries to solve the problem of the order and disorder in men's lives. In the latter case, Koheleth may be giving his own experience. To "see sleep" is to enjoy sleep. The phrase is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, but commentators quote parallels from classical sources. Thus Terence, 'Heautontim.,' 3:1.82 - <p><span class="foreign">"Somnum hercle ego hac nocte cculis non vidi reels."</span> <p><span class="accented">"No sleep mine eyes have seen this livelong night."</span> Cicero, 'Ad Famil.,' 8:30, "Fuit mittflea vigilantia, qui tote sue consulatuson, hum non vidit." Of course, the expression is hyperbolical. The same idea is found without metaphor in such passages as <a href="/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
