In biblical context, the love of money is often portrayed as a root of all kinds of evil (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The pursuit of wealth can lead to a never-ending cycle of dissatisfaction, as material possessions cannot fulfill spiritual needs. Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures, including Israel, were agrarian and valued wealth in terms of land, livestock, and produce. The warning here is timeless, emphasizing that material wealth cannot bring true contentment or happiness.<p><b>and he who loves wealth is never satisfied by income</b><br>The repetition of the theme underscores the futility of seeking fulfillment in material gain. In the cultural context of the Bible, wealth was often seen as a sign of God's blessing, yet the scriptures consistently warn against placing trust in riches (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>). The phrase suggests that no matter how much income one accumulates, it will never be enough to satisfy the deeper longings of the heart. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, where He warns against all kinds of greed, stating that life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.<p><b>This too is futile</b><br>The conclusion of the verse ties back to the overarching theme of Ecclesiastes, which is the vanity and meaninglessness of life when pursued apart from God. The term "futile" or "vanity" is a recurring motif in Ecclesiastes, often translated from the Hebrew word "hevel," meaning vapor or breath, symbolizing transience and emptiness. This reflects the book's exploration of life's purpose and the ultimate fulfillment found only in a relationship with God. The futility of wealth is a reminder that earthly pursuits are temporary and cannot provide eternal satisfaction, pointing to the need for a deeper, spiritual focus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive writings.

Money itself is not condemned; the love of it is. When affection shifts from the Giver to the gift, it becomes idolatry (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). Solomon, a man who had everything, testifies that an unchecked craving for more is a spiritual trap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is never satisfied by money</b><p>&#8226; Accumulation cannot meet soul-level needs.<p>&#8226; Every new acquisition raises the bar for the next thrill, leaving the heart emptier than before (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Like a mirage in the desert, satisfaction appears close yet keeps receding (<a href="/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he who loves wealth</b><p>Wealth promises security, prestige, and control, but those promises are shaky at best (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).

Chasing satisfaction in cash flow is like &#8220;striving after wind&#8221;&#8212;energetic, exhausting, and empty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a> exposes the hollowness of making money or wealth the object of our love. The more we crave, the less we are filled. True contentment comes only when our hearts rest in the Lord, using money as His servant rather than worshipping it as our master.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - The thought of the acts of injustice and oppression noticed above, all of which spring from the craving for money, leads the bard to dwell upon the evils that accompany this pursuit and possession of wealth, which is thus seen to give no real satisfaction. Avarice has already been noticed (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7-12</a>); the covetous man now reprobated is one who desires wealth only for the enjoyment he can get from it, or the display which it enables him to make, not, like the miser, who gloats over its mere possession. Various instances are given in which riches are unprofitable and vain. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver</span>. "Silver," the generic name for money, as Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and French <span class="accented">argent</span>. The insatiableness of the passion for money is a common theme of poets, moralists, and satirists, and is found in the proverbs of all nations. Thus Horace ('Ep.,' 1:2. 56): "Semper avarus eget;" to which St Jerome alludes ('Epist.,' 53), "Antiquum dictum est, Avaro tam deest, quod habet, quam quod non habet." Comp. Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:139 - <p><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum forget sacculus ere,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecnnia crevit."</span><br /><span class="accented">"For as thy strutting bags with money rise,<br />The love of gain is of an equal size."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Dryden.</span>) There is much more of similar import in Horace. See 'Carm.,' 2:2. 13, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:16. 17, 28; 'Ep.,' 2:2, 147; an, 1 Ovid, Fast.,' 1:211 - <p><span class="foreign">"Creverunt etopes et opum furiosa cupido,<br />Et, quum possideant plura, plura volunt."</span><br /><span class="accented">"As wealth increases grows the frenzied thirst<br />For wealth; the more they have, the more they want."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor he that loveth abundance with increase</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely presents the sense of the passage, which is not tautological, but rather that given by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qui amat divitias fructum non capiet exeis</span>, "He who loveth abundance of wealth hath no fruit therefrom;" he derives no real profit or enjoyment from the luxury which it enables him to procure; rather it brings added trouble. And so the old conclusion is again reached, this is also vanity. Hitzig takes the sentence as interrogative, "Who hath pleasure in abundance which brings nothing in?" But such questions are hardly in the style of Kohelcth, and the notion of capital without interest is not a thought which would have been then understood. The Septuagint, however, reads the clause interrogatively, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">al</span>.) <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; "And who has loved [or, has been content with] gain in its fullness?"
