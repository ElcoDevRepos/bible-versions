This sentiment is a recurring theme in Ecclesiastes, where the phrase "under the sun" signifies the earthly, temporal realm as opposed to the eternal. Solomon, known for his wisdom and wealth, had achieved great success and prosperity, yet he found these accomplishments ultimately unfulfilling. This reflects the biblical teaching that earthly achievements and material wealth cannot satisfy the deeper spiritual needs of the human soul (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The phrase also echoes the curse of labor from <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where toil is a result of the fall, highlighting the transient nature of worldly endeavors.<p><b>because I must leave it to the man who comes after me</b><br>The inevitability of leaving one's possessions to a successor underscores the transient nature of earthly life and achievements. This reflects the biblical principle that material wealth is temporary and cannot be taken beyond this life (<a href="/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>). Historically, Solomon's successor, Rehoboam, failed to maintain the kingdom's unity, leading to its division (1 Kings 12). This serves as a cautionary tale about the uncertainty of legacy and the potential for one's life's work to be squandered by future generations. Theologically, this points to the importance of investing in eternal treasures and spiritual legacy, as emphasized in the teachings of Jesus Christ (<a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33-34</a>). The phrase also invites reflection on the stewardship of resources and the responsibility to use one's blessings for God's purposes, aligning with the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.
