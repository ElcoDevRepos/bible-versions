The word "grief" here can be understood as a deep-seated sorrow or trouble that permeates daily existence. This echoes the curse of toil and labor given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where work becomes burdensome due to sin. The Preacher, traditionally understood as Solomon, speaks from experience, having pursued wisdom, pleasure, and wealth, yet finding them ultimately unsatisfying. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that true fulfillment is found only in God.<p><b>and his task is sorrowful</b><br>The term "task" refers to the labor and responsibilities that occupy a person's life. In the ancient Near Eastern context, work was often physically demanding and relentless, with little respite. The sorrow associated with work can be seen as a consequence of the fall, where labor is no longer purely joyful but is marred by hardship and pain. This sorrowful task is a reminder of the limitations of human efforts and the need for divine intervention. The New Testament offers a contrast in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where Jesus invites the weary to find rest in Him, highlighting the difference between burdensome labor and the rest found in Christ.<p><b>even at night, his mind does not rest</b><br>This phrase captures the anxiety and restlessness that accompany a life focused on earthly pursuits. The inability to find peace even at night suggests a deep-seated unrest that plagues the soul. In biblical times, night was a time for rest and rejuvenation, yet the Preacher notes that even this is elusive. This restlessness can be compared to the peace promised by God in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, where trust in the Lord allows for peaceful sleep. The contrast between the restless mind and the peace of God underscores the futility of seeking satisfaction apart from Him.<p><b>This too is futile</b><br>The conclusion of this verse reiterates the theme of vanity that runs throughout Ecclesiastes. The word "futile" or "vanity" (Hebrew: "hevel") suggests something transient, elusive, and ultimately meaningless when pursued apart from God. This futility is a central theme in Ecclesiastes, pointing to the limitations of human wisdom and achievement. The Preacher's exploration of life's meaning leads to the understanding that without a relationship with God, all human endeavors are ultimately empty. This realization is a call to seek eternal significance through faith in God, as seen in the New Testament's emphasis on storing treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.
