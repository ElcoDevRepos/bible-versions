The author, traditionally understood to be Solomon, explores the futility of seeking fulfillment through earthly desires. This pursuit is reminiscent of Solomon's own life, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-23.htm">1 Kings 10:23-27</a>, where he amassed wealth and possessions. The phrase underscores the human tendency to seek satisfaction in visible, tangible things, echoing the temptation of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>, where the fruit was "pleasing to the eye."<p><b>I refused my heart no pleasure.</b><br>Here, the heart symbolizes the seat of emotions and desires. The author indulges in every pleasure, highlighting the hedonistic approach to life. This indulgence can be compared to the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>, who squandered his inheritance on reckless living. The cultural context of ancient Israel, with its festivals and celebrations, often included feasting and merriment, which could lead to excess. The phrase warns against the dangers of unchecked desires, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>, which likens a person without self-control to a city broken into and left without walls.<p><b>For my heart took delight in all my work,</b><br>This reflects a temporary satisfaction found in accomplishments and achievements. The author acknowledges a sense of joy derived from labor, which aligns with the biblical principle that work is a gift from God (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). However, the delight is fleeting, as the overarching message of Ecclesiastes is the vanity of earthly pursuits. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, which states that unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.<p><b>and this was the reward for all my labor.</b><br>The phrase suggests that the only tangible benefit from labor is the momentary pleasure it provides. This aligns with the theme of vanity and the transient nature of worldly rewards. In the historical context, labor was often physically demanding and yielded limited returns, especially in an agrarian society. The author contrasts this with the eternal rewards promised in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>, where treasures in heaven are emphasized over earthly gains. This serves as a reminder of the ultimate futility of labor when disconnected from a divine purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Ecclesiastes, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom, wealth, and extensive building projects.

Scripture consistently affirms that joy is found not in indulging every impulse but in aligning desires, pleasures, and work with God&#8217;s will. The verse thus warns against self-centered living and points us toward the only enduring reward: delighting in the Lord and laboring for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever mine eyes desired</span>.
