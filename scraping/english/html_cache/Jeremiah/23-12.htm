The imagery of a "slick path" suggests instability and danger, symbolizing the moral and spiritual decline of the people. In biblical times, a slick path would be treacherous, leading to falls and injury, much like the spiritual peril the leaders have led the people into. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>, where the way of the wicked is described as darkness.<p><b>they will be driven away into the darkness and fall into it.</b><br>Darkness in the Bible often symbolizes judgment, confusion, and separation from God. Being "driven away into the darkness" suggests divine judgment and exile, reminiscent of the Babylonian captivity that Jeremiah prophesied. This phrase echoes the fate of those who reject God's guidance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/8-22.htm">Isaiah 8:22</a>, where people look to the earth and see only distress and darkness. The fall into darkness signifies the ultimate downfall and ruin of those who lead others astray.<p><b>For I will bring disaster upon them</b><br>This part of the verse underscores God's active role in bringing judgment. The disaster is a direct result of the people's disobedience and the false prophets' misleading teachings. This aligns with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God's laws results in calamity. It also reflects the prophetic tradition where God uses nations like Babylon as instruments of His judgment, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.<p><b>in the year of their punishment,</b><br>The "year of their punishment" indicates a specific, divinely appointed time for judgment. This concept of a set time for divine retribution is consistent with the prophetic literature, where God&#8217;s patience has limits, and a time of reckoning is inevitable. This is similar to the "day of the Lord" found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, which speaks of a time of judgment and restoration.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase affirms the authority and certainty of the prophecy. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that emphasizes that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God. It assures the audience of the truth and inevitability of the prophecy, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah and other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where God reveals His plans through His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>The primary subjects of this passage, these individuals misled the people of Judah with false assurances of peace and security.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is pronouncing judgment on the false prophets and the people who follow them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_year_of_punishment.htm">The Year of Punishment</a></b><br>A specific time appointed by God for executing judgment on those who have turned away from His ways.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_false_prophets.htm">The Danger of False Prophets</a></b><br>False prophets lead people away from God's truth, resulting in spiritual and often physical disaster.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God leads to a "slippery path," symbolizing instability and inevitable downfall.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_judgment.htm">God's Sovereign Judgment</a></b><br>God is just and will bring about judgment in His appointed time, emphasizing the importance of living in obedience to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_the_light.htm">Walking in the Light</a></b><br>Believers are called to walk in the light of God's truth, avoiding the darkness that comes from following false teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_vigilance.htm">Discernment and Vigilance</a></b><br>Christians must be vigilant and discerning, testing teachings against Scripture to avoid being led astray.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_23_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 23:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_23_12_Warning_on_false_prophets.htm">How does Jeremiah 23:12 warn against following false prophets in today's world?

God is not merely warning; He is declaring an inevitable consequence of unrepentant sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will be driven away into the darkness</b><p>&#8226; Darkness often pictures alienation from God (<a href="/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>) and exposure to judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21&#8211;23</a>). Here it describes being herded&#8212;&#8220;driven away&#8221;&#8212;beyond the light of divine favor.<p>&#8226; The imagery recalls <a href="/job/18-18.htm">Job 18:18</a>: &#8220;He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the world.&#8221; Those who claimed to reveal God&#8217;s word now stumble where no vision remains.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;driven&#8221; shows God&#8217;s active role: He Himself shepherds them out, contrasting <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a> where He guides the faithful &#8220;in paths of righteousness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fall into it</b><p>&#8226; The slippery way and deep darkness culminate in a crash. This fall is irreversible, like the ruin Jesus spoke of when the house built on sand collapsed (<a href="/matthew/7-27.htm">Matthew 7:27</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> notes, &#8220;The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.&#8221; Jeremiah ties stumbling directly to divine retribution, not mere misfortune.<p>&#8226; The fall also illustrates public exposure: those who exalted themselves as spiritual guides suffer humiliation before the nation (<a href="/jeremiah/14-15.htm">Jeremiah 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I will bring disaster upon them</b><p>&#8226; The Lord states the reason behind the imagery. Disaster (calamity) is not random; it is God-sent judgment. Compare <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>, where He forms light and creates darkness, bringing prosperity and calamity.<p>&#8226; This disaster fulfils <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>, &#8220;The prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name that I have not commanded&#8230;that prophet shall die.&#8221; God defends His holy name by acting decisively against counterfeit messengers.<p>&#8226; Notice the shift from metaphor to plain speech: no longer &#8220;they will fall,&#8221; but &#8220;I will bring.&#8221; Accountability is personal when the Judge acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the year of their punishment</b><p>&#8226; Judgment has a divinely appointed timetable. &#8220;Year&#8221; signals a fixed season, just as Babylon&#8217;s invasion had a prophesied moment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> assures that the vision &#8220;awaits an appointed time; it speaks of the end and will not prove false.&#8221; Likewise, the punishment Jeremiah foretells will not be delayed indefinitely.<p>&#8226; For the faithful remnant, this schedule affirms that God&#8217;s patience is purposeful; for the wicked, it underscores that mercy spurned today will not cancel judgment tomorrow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The closing formula seals the prophecy with divine authority. <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> reminds us God is not a man that He should lie; His declaration renders the outcome certain.<p>&#8226; Every phrase in verse 12 rests on this signature.
