The "glory" refers to the pride and self-exaltation of Moab, a nation often in conflict with Israel. In biblical terms, glory can denote wealth, power, or status, which Moab is about to lose. This echoes the biblical theme that pride precedes a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><b>sit on parched ground,</b><br>The imagery of sitting on parched ground symbolizes desolation and humiliation. Parched ground suggests a lack of life and prosperity, contrasting with the previous state of glory. This reflects the consequences of divine judgment, as seen in other scriptures where desolation follows disobedience (<a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4</a>).<p><b>O daughter dwelling in Dibon,</b><br>Dibon was a significant city in Moab, located north of the Arnon River. The term "daughter" is a poetic way to refer to the inhabitants of the city. Dibon's mention highlights its importance and the personal nature of the prophecy. Archaeological findings, such as the Mesha Stele, provide historical context, showing Dibon's prominence in Moabite culture.<p><b>for the destroyer of Moab has come against you;</b><br>The "destroyer" refers to the Babylonian forces under Nebuchadnezzar, who historically conquered Moab. This phrase indicates the certainty of Moab's downfall, fulfilling earlier prophecies against the nation (<a href="/jeremiah/25-21.htm">Jeremiah 25:21</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>he has destroyed your fortresses.</b><br>Fortresses symbolize security and strength. Their destruction signifies the complete overthrow of Moab's defenses and the futility of relying on human strength against divine judgment. This aligns with biblical themes where God dismantles human fortifications to demonstrate His power (<a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_dwelling_in_dibon.htm">Daughter dwelling in Dibon</a></b><br>This phrase personifies the city of Dibon, a significant Moabite city.

Here the famous Moabite Stone (on which see Dr. Ginsburg's exhaustive monograph), with the inscription of King Mesha (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>), was found, which, after having been broke up and pieced together, has now found a resting place in the Louvre. It is difficult to say to which Israelitish tribe Dibon was, strictly speaking, attached; for while in <a href="/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a> it is given to Reuben, in <a href="/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a> and in the Moabite Stone (line 10) it is assigned to Gad, Apparently the Israelitish population fluctuated.
