In the context of Jeremiah, God is speaking to the people of Judah, who have repeatedly turned away from Him. The "lot" and "portion" suggest a predetermined outcome, akin to the distribution of land by lot in ancient Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>). This reflects God's sovereign control over the fate of nations and individuals. The use of "measured" implies precision and justice in God's judgment, echoing the biblical principle that God is just and fair in His dealings (<a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>). The declaration by the LORD underscores the authority and finality of the message, reminiscent of prophetic declarations throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>because you have forgotten Me</b><br>Forgetting God in this context means neglecting His commandments and covenant. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a willful disregard for God's presence and laws. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>, Israel is warned against forgetting God when they become prosperous. The historical context shows that Judah had fallen into idolatry and moral decay, forgetting the God who delivered them from Egypt. This forgetfulness is a recurring theme in the prophets, highlighting the spiritual amnesia that leads to sin and judgment.<p><b>and trusted in falsehood.</b><br>Trusting in falsehood refers to reliance on idols, false prophets, and alliances with foreign nations instead of God. In Jeremiah's time, Judah often sought security through political alliances with Egypt and Assyria, rather than trusting in God (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). The falsehood also includes the deceptive messages of false prophets who assured the people of peace when destruction was imminent (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). This misplaced trust is a form of spiritual adultery, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, where Israel is accused of seeking guidance from wooden idols. Theologically, this points to the danger of placing faith in anything other than God, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Jesus warns against false prophets (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
