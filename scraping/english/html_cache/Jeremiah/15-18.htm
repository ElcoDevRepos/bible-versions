This phrase captures the emotional and spiritual turmoil that Jeremiah feels due to the rejection and persecution he faces from his own people. The unending nature of his pain can be seen as a metaphor for the ongoing rebellion of Israel against God, which results in continuous judgment and hardship. This echoes the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the enduring nature of suffering in a fallen world, as seen in the lamentations of other prophets and figures like Job.<p><b>and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?</b><br>The imagery of an incurable wound suggests a situation beyond human remedy, emphasizing the depth of Jeremiah's despair. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wounds and illnesses were often seen as manifestations of divine displeasure or judgment. Jeremiah's use of this metaphor highlights the severity of Israel's spiritual condition and the nation's refusal to repent, which makes healing impossible. This connects to the broader biblical narrative where true healing and restoration are only possible through divine intervention, as seen in the promises of a new covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<p><b>You have indeed become like a mirage to me&#8212;</b><br>Jeremiah's comparison of God to a mirage indicates a crisis of faith, where the prophet feels that God's promises of deliverance and support seem illusory. This reflects the tension between divine promises and present reality, a common theme in the lives of biblical figures who struggle with doubt and disappointment. The imagery of a mirage, something that appears real but is ultimately deceptive, underscores the prophet's sense of abandonment and confusion. This can be related to the experiences of other biblical characters, such as David in the Psalms, who also grapple with feelings of divine absence.<p><b>water that is not there.</b><br>Water is a powerful symbol in the Bible, often representing life, sustenance, and divine blessing. In a desert culture, water is essential for survival, making its absence a profound metaphor for spiritual desolation. Jeremiah's lament that God is like water that is not there highlights the depth of his spiritual thirst and the perceived absence of God's life-giving presence. This imagery connects to the New Testament, where Jesus offers "living water" (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>), fulfilling the deep spiritual needs that Jeremiah and others longed for. The promise of living water signifies the ultimate fulfillment of God's presence and provision through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing his deep anguish and questioning God about his ongoing suffering and the apparent lack of relief.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one whom Jeremiah is addressing, expressing his feelings of abandonment and questioning God's reliability.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The nation to which Jeremiah is prophesying, facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/deceptive_brook.htm">Deceptive Brook</a></b><br>A metaphor used by Jeremiah to describe his perception of God's promises as unreliable, akin to a stream that dries up when most needed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_threat.htm">Babylonian Threat</a></b><br>The looming danger and eventual exile that Judah faces, which is part of the context of Jeremiah's lament.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_suffering.htm">Understanding Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that even faithful servants of God, like Jeremiah, experience deep pain and questioning.

The tension between felt absence and promised presence is real.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s words are not unbelief but relational honesty. He knows God is faithful (<a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15-20</a>) even while confessing that, in the moment, the well seems empty.<p>&#8226; Like the deer panting for streams (<a href="/psalms/42-1.htm">Psalm 42:1</a>), the prophet thirsts, and that very thirst keeps him seeking the Lord who will ultimately satisfy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a> captures the raw heartbeat of a faithful servant wounded by relentless opposition and the apparent delay of divine relief. His pain feels endless, his wound incurable, and God&#8217;s presence like a vanishing mirage. Scripture shows that such lament is neither rebellion nor defeat; it is the honest struggle of a believer who clings to God&#8217;s character when circumstances shout the opposite. In time, the God who seems distant will prove Himself the unfailing spring, healing both prophet and people according to His perfect timetable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar . . .?</span>--The words express a bitter sense of failure and disappointment.

His vexation is perpetual, and his wounded spirit finds no comfort. <span class="cmt_word">As a liar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a deceitful stream</span>. The word "stream" has to be understood as in <a href="/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Many of the water courses of Palestine are filled with a rushing torrent in the winter, but dry in summer. Hence the pathetic complaint of Job (<a href="/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>). The opposite phrase to that used by Jeremiah is "a perennial stream" (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).
