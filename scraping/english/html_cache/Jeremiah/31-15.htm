It is a common prophetic formula used to assert that the following words are not merely human opinion but are directly from God. This underscores the importance and seriousness of the message.<p><b>A voice is heard in Ramah,</b><br>Ramah was a town in the territory of Benjamin, located about five miles north of Jerusalem. It was historically significant as a gathering place for the tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). In the context of Jeremiah, Ramah is associated with the exile of the Israelites, as it was a staging point for the deportation to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>). The mention of Ramah evokes a sense of loss and displacement.<p><b>mourning and great weeping,</b><br>The imagery of mourning and weeping conveys deep sorrow and lamentation. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, mourning was often expressed through loud cries, tearing of garments, and wearing sackcloth. This phrase captures the intense grief experienced by those who have lost loved ones or faced national calamity.<p><b>Rachel weeping for her children</b><br>Rachel, the beloved wife of Jacob, is a matriarch of Israel. She died giving birth to Benjamin and was buried near Bethlehem (<a href="/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>). In this context, Rachel symbolizes the mothers of Israel mourning for their lost children. Her weeping is metaphorical, representing the collective sorrow of the nation. This imagery is also used in the New Testament in <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, where it is applied to the massacre of the innocents by Herod, drawing a typological connection to the suffering of Christ.<p><b>and refusing to be comforted,</b><br>The refusal to be comforted highlights the depth of the grief. It suggests a loss so profound that no consolation seems possible. This reflects the despair of the exiled Israelites, who felt abandoned and hopeless. Theologically, it underscores the human condition of suffering and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>because they are no more.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the finality and completeness of the loss. The children "are no more" suggests death or disappearance, resonating with the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where many were killed or taken captive. It also foreshadows the ultimate hope of restoration and resurrection, as God promises to bring back the exiles and restore Israel, pointing to the future hope found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramah.htm">Ramah</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, historically significant as a place of gathering and lamentation.

Set in Ramah, where captives once lined the road to Babylon, the verse captures the nation&#8217;s darkest hour. Yet its placement in a chapter brimming with restoration signals hope: God hears the weeping, and He will bring the children back. Matthew later shows the verse fulfilled again in Bethlehem, linking Israel&#8217;s exile sorrow to the suffering surrounding Jesus&#8217; birth and pointing to the Savior who ultimately turns mourning into joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">A voice was heard in Ramah.</span>--The sharp contrast between this and the exulting joy of the previous verse shows that we are entering on a new section which repeats in altered form the substance of the foregoing, presenting in succession the same pictures of present woe and future gladness. The prophet sees first the desolation of the captivity. Rachel, as the mother of Joseph, and therefore of Ephraim, becomes the ideal representative of the northern kingdom. Her voice is heard in Ramah (possibly, as in <a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm" title="When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul stayed in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)">1Samuel 22:6</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16-24.htm" title="That you have also built to you an eminent place, and have made you an high place in every street.">Ezekiel 16:24</a>, and in the Vulgate here, not as the name of a locality, but in its general meaning, <span class= "ital">from a mountain height</span>) weeping for the children who have been slain or carried into exile. When used elsewhere as a proper name, the noun always has the article. Here it stands without it. If Ramah be definitely one of the places of that name, known fully as Ramathaim-zophim (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm" title="Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:">1Samuel 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm" title="And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.">1Samuel 1:19</a>), it is probably that within the borders of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>), not far from Rachel's sepulchre (<a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm" title="When you are departed from me to day, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went to seek are found: and, see, your father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?">1Samuel 10:2</a>). She, even in her grave, weeps for her children. The mention of Ramah in <a href="/isaiah/10-29.htm" title="They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.">Isaiah 10:29</a> seems to indicate that it was the scene of some special massacre in the progress of the Assyrian invader, in the reign of Hezekiah; and Jeremiah may possibly refer to it, as well as to some later atrocity, in connection with that of the Chaldaeans (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a>), over which Rachel, in her sepulchre near Bethlehem, is supposed to weep. Possibly also the meaning of the name Rachel (= ewe) may have added something to the force of the prophet's description. He hears the cry of the ewe on the hill-top bleating for her lambs. The passage has gained a special significance as being cited by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/2-18.htm" title="In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.">Matthew 2:18</a>), as fulfilled in Herod's massacre of the infants of Bethlehem. On the nature of this fulfilment see Note on <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm" title="In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.">Matthew 2:18</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-22.</span> - From this glorious prospect Jeremiah's eye turns to the melancholy present. The land of Ephraim is orphaned and desolate. The prophet seems to hear Rachel weeping for her banished children, and comforts her with the assurance that they shall yet be restored. For Ephraim has come to repentance, and longs for reconciliation with his God, and God, who has overheard his soliloquy, relents, and comes to meet him with gracious promises. Then another voice is heard summoning Ephraim to prepare for his journey home. This verse is quoted by St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/2-17.htm">Matthew 2:17</a>) with reference to the massacre of the innocents, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> prefixed. The latter formula of itself suggests that there was a previous fulfilment of the prophecy, but that the analogy of the circumstances of the innocents justifies - nay, requires - the admission of a second fulfilment. In fact, the promise of the Messianic age seemed in as much danger of being rendered void when Herod wreaked his fury on the children of Bethlehem, as when the tribes of Israel were scattered in exile. Dean Stanley finds a geographical inconsistency in the two passages. "The context of <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> implies that the Ramah of the prophet was in the northern kingdom, probably Ramah of Benjamin. The context of <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, on the other hand, implies that the Ramah of the evangelist was within sight of Bethlehem" ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 225). But this remark involves the assumption that the quotation was not intended merely as an application. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice was heard;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is heard.</span> It is a participle, indicating the continuance of the action. <span class="cmt_word">In Ramah.</span> In the neighbourhood of which town Rachel was buried, according to <a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> ("the city" where Samuel and Saul were - <a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a> - appears to have been Ramah). <span class="cmt_word">Rachel weeping for her children.</span> Rachel ("Rahel" is only a Germanizing way of writing the name), being the ancestress of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, is represented as feeling like a mother for all the tribes connected with those three. Her "weeping" is no mere figure of speech. Jeremiah believes that the patriarchs and holy men of old continue to feel an interest in the fortunes of their descendants (comp. <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;
