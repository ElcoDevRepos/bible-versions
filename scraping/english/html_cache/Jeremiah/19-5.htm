These locations were typically associated with pagan rituals and idolatry, contrary to the worship of Yahweh. Baal was a prominent Canaanite deity, often associated with fertility and storms. The Israelites' adoption of Baal worship reflects a significant departure from their covenant with God, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>, where Israel repeatedly falls into idolatry. The construction of high places indicates a formal and organized effort to integrate Baal worship into their religious practices, directly violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>on which to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal&#8212;</b><br>Child sacrifice was a horrific practice associated with some ancient Near Eastern religions, including the worship of Baal and Molech. This act was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The burning of children as offerings signifies the depth of Israel's apostasy and moral decline. Archaeological evidence from sites like Carthage suggests that child sacrifice was indeed practiced in the ancient world, providing a grim backdrop to the biblical narrative. This practice is a stark contrast to the character of God, who values life and abhors such abominations.<p><b>something I never commanded or mentioned,</b><br>God's laws and commands, as given through Moses, never included or implied the need for human sacrifice. This phrase emphasizes the complete divergence of these practices from God's will. In <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, God explicitly condemns such acts. The mention of God's lack of command or mention highlights the Israelites' deviation from divine instruction and underscores the gravity of their sin. It also serves as a reminder of God's consistent character, which is life-affirming and just.<p><b>nor did it even enter My mind.</b><br>This expression underscores the utter foreignness of such practices to God's nature and intentions. It emphasizes that the idea of child sacrifice is so abhorrent that it is inconceivable to God. This phrase serves to highlight the contrast between the holiness of God and the depravity of the people's actions. It also reflects the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to the true worship of Yahweh, as seen in the messages of prophets like Isaiah and Hosea, who often spoke against idolatry and injustice. This statement reinforces the idea that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>) and that His plans are for life and not destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
