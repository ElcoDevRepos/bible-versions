Babylon, a symbol of pride and idolatry, was a powerful empire that oppressed Israel. The destruction of Babylon fulfills prophecies given earlier in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>). Historically, Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC, an event that demonstrated God's control over world events. This destruction also prefigures the ultimate fall of spiritual Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, symbolizing the defeat of all systems opposed to God.<p><b>He will silence her mighty voice.</b><br>Babylon was known for its grandeur and influence, often boasting of its power and achievements. The "mighty voice" represents its authority and the pride of its rulers, such as Nebuchadnezzar. God's silencing of Babylon's voice signifies the end of its dominance and the futility of human pride against divine will. This echoes the biblical theme that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>The waves will roar like great waters;</b><br>The imagery of roaring waves suggests chaos and overwhelming force. In biblical literature, waters often symbolize nations and peoples (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>). The roaring waves could represent the invading armies of the Medes and Persians, who would come like a flood to conquer Babylon. This metaphor also connects to the idea of God's judgment being unstoppable and powerful, as seen in other prophetic writings (<a href="/psalms/93-3.htm">Psalm 93:3-4</a>).<p><b>the tumult of their voices will resound.</b><br>The tumult refers to the noise and confusion of battle as Babylon faces its downfall. This phrase emphasizes the totality of Babylon's destruction, as the once mighty city is overtaken by the clamor of its conquerors. The resounding voices can also be seen as a contrast to Babylon's silenced voice, highlighting the reversal of fortunes. This tumult is reminiscent of the chaos at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>), where God confused human language, symbolizing the futility of human efforts against divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is executing judgment against Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and idolatry, which is being judged by God for its sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages, including the prophecy of Babylon's destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mighty_voice_of_babylon.htm">The Mighty Voice of Babylon</a></b><br>Represents the pride, power, and influence of Babylon, which God promises to silence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_roaring_waves.htm">The Roaring Waves</a></b><br>Symbolic of the overwhelming judgment and chaos that will come upon Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and empires, regardless of their power or influence.
