The command is rooted in the historical context of the Exodus, where God delivered His people from Egypt and gave them the Law. This command is a reminder of the covenant stipulations found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.<p><b>Obey Me,</b><br>Obedience is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The Hebrew concept of obedience involves hearing and responding to God's voice. This call to obedience is echoed throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema emphasizes loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. Obedience is not merely external compliance but involves a heart aligned with God's will.<p><b>and I will be your God,</b><br>This promise signifies the personal and communal relationship God desires with His people. It reflects the covenant formula found in <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm">Ezekiel 37:27</a>, where God promises His presence among His people. This relationship is foundational to Israel's identity and mission, setting them apart from other nations.<p><b>and you will be My people.</b><br>Being God's people implies a special status and responsibility. It involves living according to God's laws and reflecting His character to the nations. This identity is reaffirmed in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where believers are described as a chosen people and a royal priesthood, indicating continuity between the Old and New Covenants.<p><b>You must walk in all the ways I have commanded you,</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies a lifestyle of consistent obedience and faithfulness. The metaphor of walking suggests a journey or pilgrimage, highlighting the ongoing nature of the relationship with God. This concept is reiterated in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God requires His people to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him.<p><b>so that it may go well with you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the blessings associated with obedience. The Deuteronomic principle of blessings and curses (Deuteronomy 28) is evident here, where obedience leads to prosperity and well-being. This promise is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and communal flourishing. The ultimate fulfillment of this promise is seen in the New Covenant, where believers experience abundant life in Christ (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Blessing here is both temporal (national stability) and eternal (life in Christ).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23</a> captures the heartbeat of the covenant: God commands obedience, promises His presence, grants identity, requires whole-life faithfulness, and offers blessing. The verse reminds every generation that true worship is measured not by ritual but by responsive obedience that flows from a redeemed relationship with the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">But this thing commanded I them.</span>--The words that follow are a composite quotation, partly from the lately re-found Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm" title="You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>), partly from the words that were strictly true of the "day" when Israel came out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a>), partly from the very book which seemed to be most characterised by sacrificial ritual, Leviticus (<a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm" title="And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.">Leviticus 26:12</a>). The influence of Jeremiah's teaching on later Jewish thought is shown by the fact that this very section of Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/7-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.">Jeremiah 7:21-28</a>) appears in the Synagogue ritual as the <span class= "ital">Haphtara, </span>or second lesson from the prophets, after Leviticus 6-8, as the <span class= "ital">Parashah, </span>or first lesson from the Law. The Synagogue worship, indeed, was, in the nature of the case, the result of the teaching of scribes and prophets rather than of priests, and therefore a witness for the spiritual truth symbolised in sacrifice, and not for the perpetuation of the symbol.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this thing...
