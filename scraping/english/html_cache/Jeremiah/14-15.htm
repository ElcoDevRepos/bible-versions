In the biblical context, prophets were expected to speak God's truth. However, false prophets often arose, claiming divine authority without being sent by God. This is a recurring issue in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where God warns against false prophecy. The use of "in My name" highlights the seriousness of their deception, as they falsely claim divine endorsement.<p><b>I did not send them,</b><br>This statement underscores the illegitimacy of the false prophets. In the historical context of ancient Israel, a true prophet was one who was called and sent by God, as seen with prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The false prophets lacked this divine commissioning, making their messages unreliable and dangerous. This distinction is crucial, as it separates true divine revelation from human fabrication.<p><b>yet they say, &#8216;No sword or famine will touch this land.&#8217;</b><br>The false prophets were offering a message of peace and security, contradicting the warnings given by true prophets like Jeremiah. In the cultural and historical context, sword and famine were common consequences of disobedience to God, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. By denying these impending judgments, the false prophets were misleading the people, providing a false sense of security.<p><b>By sword and famine these very prophets will meet their end!</b><br>This phrase serves as a divine pronouncement of judgment against the false prophets. It is both ironic and just that the very calamities they denied would be the means of their demise. This fulfills the principle of divine retribution, where the punishment fits the crime. Theologically, it underscores God's justice and the certainty of His word, as seen in other prophetic judgments throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10-16</a>.
