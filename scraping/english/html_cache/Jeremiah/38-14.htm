His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from Babylon. Jeremiah, a major prophet, was known for his messages of impending judgment and calls for repentance. Zedekiah's summoning of Jeremiah indicates a moment of desperation, seeking divine insight amidst the crisis.<p><b>and received him at the third entrance to the house of the LORD.</b><br>The "third entrance" suggests a private or less conspicuous location, possibly indicating Zedekiah's fear of being seen consulting Jeremiah, who was unpopular due to his prophecies. The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a central place of worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. This setting underscores the gravity of the meeting, as it takes place in a sacred space.<p><b>&#8220;I am going to ask you something,&#8221; said the king to Jeremiah.</b><br>Zedekiah's approach to Jeremiah shows a level of respect and acknowledgment of Jeremiah's role as a prophet.

This is not Zedekiah&#8217;s first summons. Earlier, when the Babylonian siege tightened, &#8220;King Zedekiah secretly sent for him and asked, &#8216;Is there a word from the LORD?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s repeated resort to Jeremiah reveals:<p>&#8211; A conscience pricked by prior warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1-2</a>).<p>&#8211; An awareness that no other counsel could equal God&#8217;s.<p>&#8211; His failure to silence the prophet, even after allowing his officials to cast Jeremiah into the cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servant remains available&#8212;even to an unstable monarch&#8212;showing the Lord&#8217;s patient desire that leaders hear truth (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>; compare <a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a> where Felix repeatedly calls for Paul).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and received him at the third entrance to the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The location hints at secrecy. Like Nicodemus visiting Jesus by night (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), Zedekiah wants privacy, not public accountability.<p>&#8226; Fear of princes drove him here; these officials had already persecuted Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, the king hides while searching for light. <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, &#8220;The fear of man brings a snare.&#8221; When God&#8217;s voice is sought behind closed doors, courage to act on it must follow (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple setting underscores that genuine guidance comes in God&#8217;s presence. Yet the king&#8217;s reverence is superficial; he honors the place but hesitates to honor the word (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am going to ask you something,&#8221; said the king to Jeremiah</b><p>&#8226; Zedekiah acknowledges Jeremiah&#8217;s unique access to God, much like Pharaoh turned to Joseph for interpretation (<a href="/genesis/41-15.htm">Genesis 41:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; His phrasing is urgent&#8212;there is no time for diplomacy. The Babylonian armies are at the gate (<a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, desire for information is not submission. Contrast Josiah, who tore his robes upon hearing the book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11-13</a>). Zedekiah wants insight without surrender.<p>&#8226; True seeking involves:<p>&#8211; A humble heart (<a href="/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a>).<p>&#8211; A resolved will to obey whatever God reveals (<a href="/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do not hide anything from me.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The plea reflects anxiety that Jeremiah might soften or withhold words of judgment. Earlier the prophet had warned, &#8220;If you surrender&#8230;your life will be spared&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s integrity is already proven: he declared the whole message despite beatings and imprisonment (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; 26:14-15). Like Paul, he did not shrink from proclaiming &#8220;the whole counsel of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Zedekiah&#8217;s request affirms a foundational principle&#8212;God&#8217;s word must be delivered in full. <a href="/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a> shows what happens when people demand pleasant messages; disaster follows.<p>&#8226; For believers today:<p>&#8211; Receive the entire Scripture, not selective portions (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p>&#8211; Encourage teachers who speak plainly, even when truth is uncomfortable (<a href="/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a> captures a king in crisis and a prophet unwavering. Zedekiah privately seeks the man he once allowed to be persecuted, proving he knows where truth resides yet fears public allegiance to it. The clandestine temple meeting exposes the snare of people-pleasing leadership. His urgent request that nothing be hidden acknowledges Jeremiah&#8217;s credibility while revealing his own wavering heart. The verse therefore calls readers to value God&#8217;s unvarnished word, to seek it openly, and&#8212;unlike Zedekiah&#8212;to obey it courageously when it comes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The third entry that is in the house of the Lord.</span>--In <a href="/2_kings/16-18.htm" title="And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria.">2Kings 16:18</a> we read of" the king's entry without," an outside entrance, and of "a covert," or covered gallery, both leading from the palace to the Temple. The passage now mentioned (the name does not occur elsewhere) was probably distinct from both these, leading from the lower city, and may therefore have been chosen by Zedekiah as a more suitable place for a private interview with the prophet. It seems probable from <a href="/2_kings/23-11.htm" title="And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.">2Kings 23:11</a>, that there was a chamber for the chief Eunuch, or chamberlain of the king's household, and if, it may have been arranged by Ebed-melech that the meeting should take place there. As in <a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm" title="Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, you shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 37:17</a>, the king has still a secret respect for Jeremiah's mission, and, it may be, guided now by the Eunuch's better counsels, hankers after <span class= "bld">a </span>word of the Lord from him.
