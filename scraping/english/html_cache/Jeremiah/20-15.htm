In the ancient Near Eastern culture, messengers often brought news of significant events, and the birth of a son was typically a cause for celebration. Jeremiah's curse on the messenger highlights his intense personal suffering and the reversal of expected joy. This sentiment echoes Job's lament in <a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where he curses the day of his birth, illustrating a profound sense of hopelessness.<p><b>saying, &#8220;A son is born to you,&#8221;</b><br>The birth of a son in ancient Israel was a momentous occasion, often associated with the continuation of the family line and inheritance rights. Sons were seen as a blessing from God, as reflected in <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>. Jeremiah's lamentation here underscores the depth of his sorrow, as he wishes to negate even the joy of his own birth. This reflects the broader theme of suffering and rejection that Jeremiah experiences as a prophet.<p><b>bringing him great joy.</b><br>The joy associated with the birth of a son is a common theme in biblical narratives, such as the birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah in <a href="/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6-7</a>. However, Jeremiah's reversal of this joy into a curse highlights the prophet's isolation and the burden of his prophetic mission. This inversion of expected joy can be seen as a type of Christ, who also experienced rejection and sorrow despite being the source of ultimate joy and salvation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing his deep anguish and despair in this passage.

His words are not doctrinal statements about cursing but the raw vocabulary of suffering (cf. <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture preserves these cries to show that even the most faithful can feel crushed (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: Jeremiah had once blessed the nations through his preaching (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5&#8211;10</a>); now he wishes judgment on a single messenger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who brought my father the news</b><p>&#8226; In ancient culture a family servant or relative would hurry to the father with birth news (<a href="/genesis/29-12.htm">Genesis 29:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah targets that nameless runner as a symbol of the circumstances that ushered him into a life of misery and rejection (<a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Though his words seem harsh, the focus is not on personal vengeance but on the bitter irony that the very announcement intended to spark celebration feels, in hindsight, like the starting gun for a lifetime of pain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;A son is born to you,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The birth of a son carried weight: continuation of the family line, economic help, and covenant promise (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets often used birth imagery&#8212;sometimes hopeful (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), sometimes sorrowful (<a href="/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>). Jeremiah twists the customary phrase into a lament, turning the expected blessing into a perceived curse.<p>&#8226; His cry foreshadows another Man of Sorrows who would be &#8220;despised and rejected&#8221; from birth onward (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bringing him great joy</b><p>&#8226; A father&#8217;s delight at a child&#8217;s arrival is normal and God-given (<a href="/proverbs/23-24.htm">Proverbs 23:24</a>; <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s grief is intensified because his father&#8217;s joy stands in painful contrast to the prophet&#8217;s lived reality of scorn, imprisonment, and threats (<a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; 38:6).<p>&#8226; The verse underlines how sin-ravaged circumstances can twist even life&#8217;s brightest moments into occasions for anguish, yet it also points to the ultimate reversal when God wipes every tear (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-15.htm">Jeremiah 20:15</a> captures a faithful servant at the end of his rope. He pours out a passionate, hyperbolic curse on the messenger who once thrilled his father with news of his birth. The verse is not a theological mandate to curse but a window into human frailty. It underscores three truths: life in a fallen world can make even joyous events feel bitter; God allows His children to voice honest pain; and such cries ultimately drive us to the One who redeems sorrow and ensures that every announcement of life becomes eternal good news in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Making him very glad.</span>--The memory, or rather the thought of that day, the joy of father and another when their child was born (<a href="/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>) was wanted, as in the irony of destiny, to add the keenest pang to the misery of the present. The "sorrow's crown of sorrow" was found in remembering happier days. We note the same tenderness turned to bitterness as in <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.">Jeremiah 15:10</a>.
