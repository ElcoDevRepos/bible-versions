The term "defiled" refers to spiritual impurity, often associated with idol worship. The Baals were Canaanite deities, and worshiping them was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where Israel turns away from God to follow other gods, leading to their downfall (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>). The rhetorical question highlights the self-deception and hypocrisy of the people, who claim innocence despite clear evidence of their unfaithfulness.<p><b>Look at your behavior in the valley; acknowledge what you have done.</b><br>The "valley" likely refers to the Valley of Hinnom, a site associated with idolatrous practices, including child sacrifice to Molech (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). This location became synonymous with sin and judgment, later evolving into the concept of Gehenna, a symbol of hell. The call to "acknowledge" is a plea for repentance, urging the Israelites to confront their sins honestly. This reflects the prophetic tradition of calling God's people to return to Him with a contrite heart (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p><b>You are a swift young she-camel galloping here and there,</b><br>The imagery of a "swift young she-camel" suggests restlessness and lack of direction, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness and pursuit of foreign gods. Camels were known for their speed and ability to travel long distances, but here the metaphor implies aimless wandering and instability. This reflects Israel's spiritual adultery, as they chase after various idols without commitment to the true God. The metaphor is consistent with other prophetic imagery depicting Israel's infidelity, such as Hosea's portrayal of Israel as an unfaithful wife (<a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Had he not, acting on Hilkiah's counsels, suppressed Baal-worship (<a href="/context/2_kings/23-4.htm" title="And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.">2Kings 23:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/34-4.htm" title="And they broke down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he broke in pieces, and made dust of them, and strewed it on the graves of them that had sacrificed to them.">2Chronicles 34:4</a>)? The answer to such pleas is to point to the rites that were still practised openly or in secret. In the "valley" of Ben-Hinnom, which Josiah had defiled (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm" title="And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.">2Kings 23:10</a>), the horrid ritual of Molech (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm" title="And you shall not let any of your seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm" title="Again, you shall say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that gives any of his seed to Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.">Leviticus 20:2</a>) was still in use (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm" title="And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.">Jeremiah 7:31</a>), reviving, we may believe, on the death of Josiah; and this, though not actually the worship of Baal, was at least as evil, and probably, in the confluence of many forms of worship which marked the last days of the monarchy of Judah, was closely associated and practically identified with it, both by the prophet and the people (<a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-35.htm" title="And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.">Jeremiah 32:35</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How canst thou say</span>, etc.? This is not a mere rhetorical fiction equivalent to "or if thou shouldst perhaps say," but probably represents an objection really made by the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah. Their fault was not in neglecting the public worship of Jehovah in his appointed temple, but in superadding to this, idolatrous rites inconsistent with the spiritual religion taught by Jeremiah. The people did not, it seems, regard this as tantamount to "following Baalim," just as some converts to Christianity in our own foreign missions might exclaim against being accused of apostasy, because they secretly carry on certain heathen practices. The prophet, however, applies a more rigorous test to their conduct. <span class="cmt_word">Baalim</span>; the plural of Baal, used for "other gods" (<a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; comp. on ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Thy way in the valley</span>. <span class="accented">The valley</span> in this context can only be that of Hinnom (see on Jeremiah 7:31), which from the time of Ahaz had been defiled with the rites of "Moloch, horrid king" (see ' Paradise Lost,' 1:392-396). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a swift dromedary</span>.
