His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from both Babylon and Egypt. Zedekiah often sought counsel from Jeremiah, despite not heeding his warnings. This reflects the tension between political expediency and spiritual truth. Jeremiah, a prophet during this tumultuous time, was often imprisoned or persecuted for his messages, which were unpopular with the ruling class.<p><b>and received him in his palace</b><br>The palace was a symbol of royal authority and power, yet Zedekiah's need to consult Jeremiah privately indicates his insecurity and the gravity of the situation. The palace setting contrasts with Jeremiah's usual place of confinement, highlighting the king's desperation for divine insight amidst the siege of Jerusalem by Babylonian forces.<p><b>where he asked him privately</b><br>The private nature of this meeting suggests Zedekiah's fear of public opinion and the influence of his officials, who were often hostile to Jeremiah. It underscores the king's internal conflict and his awareness of Jeremiah's genuine prophetic gift, despite his reluctance to follow God's directives.<p><b>&#8220;Is there a word from the LORD?&#8221;</b><br>This question reveals Zedekiah's recognition of Jeremiah as a true prophet, despite his previous disregard for Jeremiah's messages. It reflects a common biblical theme where leaders seek divine guidance in times of crisis. The phrase also emphasizes the importance of seeking God's will, even when it challenges human plans.<p><b>&#8220;There is,&#8221; Jeremiah replied.</b><br>Jeremiah's response is direct and confident, characteristic of his prophetic ministry. His assurance contrasts with the uncertainty of the king, highlighting the clarity and authority of God's message. This moment underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, delivering messages regardless of their reception.<p><b>&#8220;You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy was consistent with Jeremiah's earlier warnings about the consequences of Judah's disobedience. It fulfilled God's judgment against the nation for its idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. The phrase foreshadows the fall of Jerusalem and the exile, events that were pivotal in Jewish history. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His use of foreign powers to accomplish His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.

Similar royal summons appear in <a href="/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2 and 38</a>:14&#8211;16, underscoring that the Word of the LORD cannot be silenced, even by political power. Like Herod drawing John the Baptist close (<a href="/mark/6-20.htm">Mark 6:20</a>), Zedekiah&#8217;s curiosity reveals a heart uneasy under conviction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A private audience</b><p>The king receives Jeremiah &#8220;privately,&#8221; hinting at fear of public opinion and political backlash. &#8226; Zedekiah hid his spiritual concerns behind palace walls, just as Nicodemus came to Jesus by night (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>). &#8226; Secrecy contrasts with the prophetic call to declare God&#8217;s truth openly (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). &#8226; The scene exposes the danger of craving God&#8217;s counsel while fearing man (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seeking a prophetic word</b><p>&#8220;Is there a word from the LORD?&#8221; shows respect for Jeremiah&#8217;s office yet ignorance of what has been repeatedly proclaimed. Cross references: <a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1&#8211;7 and 34</a>:1&#8211;3 record identical inquiries met with the same answer. Like Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>, Zedekiah wants a comforting revelation but braces for something else. The request illustrates:<p>- Acknowledge the LORD&#8217;s sovereignty even when living in rebellion (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- Expect God to speak through His appointed messengers (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>).<p>- Realize access to truth does not guarantee obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Certainty of divine message</b><p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; Jeremiah replies with unwavering confidence. No hedging, no apology&#8212;just certainty (<a href="/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28&#8211;29</a>). The prophet&#8217;s assurance echoes Micaiah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14</a>) and Paul before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25&#8211;26</a>).

Key lessons:<p>- God&#8217;s judgments are specific and inescapable (<a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>).<p>- National destiny hinges on spiritual fidelity (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-45.htm">Deuteronomy 28:45&#8211;52</a>).<p>- Yet even in judgment, God preserves a remnant (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11&#8211;14</a>), offering hope to those who heed His word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a> captures the tension between a wavering monarch and an unswerving prophet. Zedekiah&#8217;s secret summons, Jeremiah&#8217;s clear affirmation, and the stark pronouncement of Babylonian conquest remind us that God&#8217;s Word is living, certain, and demands response.

He regrets the severity of the prophet's treatment, and hopes that there may yet be "a word of the Lord" less harsh than before, and with this view summons him to his palace, as before he had sent asking for his intercession. The prophet is, however, true to his calling, and not even the hope of gaining protection against his persecutors will lead him to change one jot or tittle of his message. He answers with a stern abruptness, and adds the new prediction, that the king himself shall be taken prisoner,--what is now reported being earlier than <a href="/context/jeremiah/32-4.htm" title="And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;">Jeremiah 32:4-5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Meantime the Chaldean army has returned, and reinvested the city.
