In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>, King Zedekiah and the people of Judah had made a covenant to release their Hebrew slaves, but they reneged on this promise. The phrase "deliver into the hands of their enemies" is a common biblical expression indicating divine judgment and abandonment to the consequences of one's actions. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem, where the Babylonians, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, were the enemies seeking the lives of the Judeans. This judgment is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to being handed over to enemies. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of covenant faithfulness and the consequences of breaking it.<p><b>Their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.</b><br>This imagery is a vivid depiction of disgrace and dishonor in ancient Near Eastern culture. Proper burial was important in Israelite society, and the lack of it was seen as a curse and a sign of divine disfavor. The phrase echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where disobedience results in bodies being left unburied, a fate considered shameful and humiliating. This also connects to the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah earlier in his ministry (<a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm">Jeremiah 7:33, 16</a>:4), emphasizing the certainty and severity of God's judgment. Theologically, it serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. In a broader biblical context, it foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation from God for those who reject His covenant, contrasting with the hope of resurrection and eternal life for the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

He wields the nations as instruments of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p>- Behind the judgment stands Judah&#8217;s breach of covenant, highlighted earlier in the chapter when they freed slaves only to re-enslave them (<a href="/jeremiah/34-17.htm">Jeremiah 34:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives</b><p>- The phrase pictures God handing over Judah&#8217;s leaders to people who actively &#8220;seek their lives,&#8221; echoing <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7 and 37</a>:17 where Zedekiah meets Nebuchadnezzar face-to-face.<p>- &#8220;Into the hands&#8221; stresses helplessness&#8212;once God withdraws protection, no alliance or fortification can save (<a href="/psalms/31-8.htm">Psalm 31:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/1-14.htm">Lamentations 1:14</a>).<p>- This fulfills the covenant warning of <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>, &#8220;I will set My face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their corpses will become food</b><p>- The judgment continues beyond death: &#8220;Their corpses will become food&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-20.htm">Jeremiah 34:20</a>).<p>- Lack of burial in the ancient Near East was a humiliation. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a> predicted, &#8220;Your carcasses will be food for every bird of the air and beast of the earth.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/79-2.htm">Psalm 79:2</a> laments the same curse when Jerusalem fell to Babylon: &#8220;They have given the dead bodies of Your servants for food to the birds of the air.&#8221;<p>- God&#8217;s words here affirm that covenant disobedience brings the very penalties He warned about&#8212;He keeps His word both in blessing and in judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth</b><p>- This final line broadens the scene: scavenging birds and beasts complete the disgrace.

The verse fulfills prior covenant warnings (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>), affirms God&#8217;s unwavering justice, and calls every reader to honor His Word, knowing He keeps every promise&#8212;whether of mercy or of judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Their dead bodies shall be for meat . . .</span>--As in <a href="/jeremiah/7-33.htm" title="And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.">Jeremiah 7:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm" title="They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung on the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 16:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-7.htm" title="And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 19:7</a>, this takes its place as the extremest penalty of transgression.
