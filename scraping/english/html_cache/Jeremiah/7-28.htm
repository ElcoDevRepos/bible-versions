Prophets often faced resistance, as seen with figures like Moses and Elijah, yet they were compelled to speak God's truth.<p><b>&#8216;This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God</b><br>The nation referred to is Judah, which consistently ignored God's commands and warnings. This reflects a pattern of disobedience seen throughout Israel's history, such as during the time of the judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). Listening to God's voice is a recurring theme, highlighting the importance of obedience and the consequences of neglect.<p><b>and would not receive correction.</b><br>Judah's refusal to accept correction is indicative of a hardened heart. <a href="/proverbs/12.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a> states, "Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid." This resistance to correction is a sign of spiritual rebellion and pride, which ultimately leads to judgment.<p><b>Truth has perished;</b><br>The absence of truth signifies a moral and spiritual decay within the nation. In <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>, Jesus declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life," indicating that truth is found in God alone. The perishing of truth suggests a departure from God's ways and a society that has embraced falsehood.<p><b>it has disappeared from their lips.</b><br>This phrase underscores the complete abandonment of truth in speech and action. The lips, often used in Scripture to represent communication, are devoid of honesty and integrity. This mirrors the condition described in <a href="/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14-15</a>, where justice and truth are lacking, leading to societal collapse. The absence of truth in speech reflects a deeper spiritual crisis, as the heart and mouth are interconnected (<a href="/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
