The phrase indicates divine judgment, emphasizing God's sovereignty and justice. Edom's pride and hostility towards Israel are key reasons for this judgment, as seen in <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>. The plans of the LORD reflect His omniscience and authority over nations, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>.<p><b>and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman</b><br>Teman, a region in Edom, was known for its wise men (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). The mention of strategies highlights God's deliberate and purposeful actions. This reflects the biblical theme that human wisdom cannot stand against divine wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>). The judgment on Teman underscores the futility of relying on human strength and wisdom.<p><b>Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away</b><br>The "little ones of the flock" symbolizes the vulnerable and defenseless, possibly referring to the people of Edom. This imagery is used to convey the totality of the coming judgment, where even the weakest will not escape. It echoes the shepherd imagery found in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God judges false shepherds and rescues His flock.<p><b>certainly their pasture will be made desolate because of them</b><br>The desolation of the pasture signifies complete devastation and ruin. In an agrarian society, pastures were vital for survival, so their destruction indicates severe judgment. This desolation is a consequence of Edom's actions and attitudes, aligning with the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>. The imagery also points to the ultimate restoration and renewal promised in passages like <a href="/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35:1-2</a>, where desolate lands will rejoice and blossom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.
