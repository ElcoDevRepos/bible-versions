In the context of ancient Israel, prophets often served as God's messengers, delivering His word not only to Israel but to surrounding nations. The call to announce to the nations signifies the universal scope of God's sovereignty and judgment. This mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>lift up a banner and proclaim it;</b><br>Banners were used in ancient times as signals or standards in battle, representing a call to gather or a declaration of victory. Here, lifting a banner symbolizes a clear and visible declaration of God's message. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, where a banner is raised for the nations, indicating a gathering of God's people.<p><b>hold nothing back when you say,</b><br>The instruction to hold nothing back underscores the urgency and completeness of the message. Prophets were often tasked with delivering difficult truths, and this phrase emphasizes the need for full disclosure of God's impending judgment. This reflects the prophetic responsibility seen in <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-19</a>, where the prophet is warned to deliver God's message fully.<p><b>&#8216;Babylon is captured;</b><br>Babylon, a dominant empire known for its wealth and power, is prophesied to fall. This prophecy is significant as Babylon was seen as a symbol of human pride and opposition to God. The fall of Babylon is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing the ultimate defeat of worldly powers opposed to God, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<p><b>Bel is put to shame;</b><br>Bel, also known as Baal, was a major deity in Babylonian religion. The shaming of Bel signifies the impotence of false gods before the true God of Israel. This echoes the narrative of Elijah and the prophets of Baal in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, where the powerlessness of Baal is exposed.<p><b>Marduk is shattered,</b><br>Marduk was the chief god of Babylon, often associated with creation and order. The shattering of Marduk represents the dismantling of Babylon's religious and cultural identity. This act of divine judgment highlights the futility of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>, where Babylonian gods are depicted as burdensome idols.<p><b>her images are disgraced,</b><br>The disgrace of Babylon's images points to the humiliation of its religious symbols. In ancient cultures, the destruction or desecration of idols was a powerful statement against the gods they represented. This is reminiscent of the account in <a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>, where the idol Dagon falls before the Ark of the Covenant.<p><b>her idols are broken in pieces.&#8217;</b><br>The breaking of idols signifies the complete overthrow of Babylon's spiritual and political power. This act of divine judgment serves as a reminder of the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>, which prohibits idolatry. It also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over all earthly powers, as depicted in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant empire in biblical history, known for its power and influence.

The verse calls believers to proclaim truth boldly, trust God&#8217;s unfailing word, and renounce every idol, confident that the Lord who toppled Babylon will likewise overthrow all powers that oppose Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Set up</span> <span class= "bld">a standard.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">lift up a signal. </span>The noun is the same as in <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm" title="Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/4-21.htm" title="How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?">Jeremiah 4:21</a>. Here, however, its use is not that of furnishing a rallying point for an army, but that of a means of rapid communication, like the succession of beacon-fires in the opening of the <span class= "ital">Agamemnon </span>of 'schylus (<span class= "ital">Agam., </span>272-307). The tidings of the fall of Babylon are to be proclaimed as quickly as may be throughout the world.<p><span class= "bld">Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces.</span>--Strictly speaking these, as found in the inscriptions, were names of the same deity (see Note on <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>). The name of Bel appears in the names of the two great walls of Babylon, Imgur-Bel and Nimetti-Bel (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 125). The latter name, sometimes in the form of Marduk, appears as lord of heaven and earth, and Nebo is subordinate to him. Nebuchadnezzar's devotion to him is indicated by <span class= "ital">the name </span>he gave his son, Evil-merodach (<a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>), and by describing himself in his inscriptions as "worshipper of Marduk" (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, v.</span> 113). So we have among Chaldaean names Merodach-baladan (<a href="/2_kings/20-12.htm" title="At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.">2Kings 20:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>), Kurdur-Marduk, and others. The inscriptions at Borsippa speak of him as "the great lord, the most ancient of the gods, the lord of the gates of heaven," and so on (Rawlinson's <span class= "ital">Herodotus, </span>i. 627-631). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-10.</span> - Babylon's fall and Israel's deliverance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - The prophet, with the eye of faith, sees his revelation accomplished.

In his exuberant joy, he calls on the bystanders to proclaim the good news to the sympathetic nations, and to <span class="cmt_word">set up</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">lift up</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>a standard</span> (as <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>), to call the attention of those who might not be within hearing of the proclamation.

Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the <span class="accented">possessor</span> of intelligence" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as "the god my maker," "the chief of the gods," and of himself as "his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart." Her images. It is a very peculiar word (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (<a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is "things rolled," which may be variously interpreted as "idol blocks" (Gesenius), or "doll images" (Ewald). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Announce</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb -
