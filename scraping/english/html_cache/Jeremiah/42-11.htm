Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, and its king was known for his military prowess and harsh treatment of conquered peoples. The Israelites had witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, leading to their fear. This command not to fear echoes God's frequent assurances to His people throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God tells Israel not to fear because He is with them. The fear of earthly powers is contrasted with the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD,</b><br>The repetition of the command not to fear emphasizes its importance. The declaration "declares the LORD" underscores the authority and reliability of the message. In the biblical context, when God speaks, His words are trustworthy and powerful. This assurance is meant to shift the focus from human threats to divine sovereignty. The phrase also reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God promises protection and guidance.<p><b>for I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.</b><br>This promise of God's presence is a recurring theme in the Bible, providing comfort and assurance to His people. The phrase "I am with you" is reminiscent of God's promise to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a> and to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, where God's presence is linked to His people's success and security. The terms "save" and "deliver" indicate not just physical rescue but also spiritual salvation, pointing to God's ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus is often seen as the fulfillment of God's promises of salvation and deliverance, as seen in <a href="/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, where He is named Jesus because He will save His people from their sins. This phrase reassures the Israelites that despite their current fears, God's power and presence are sufficient to protect and redeem them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The group of Israelites left in Judah after the Babylonian exile, seeking guidance from God through Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_babylon.htm">The King of Babylon</a></b><br>Refers to Nebuchadnezzar, the powerful ruler who conquered Jerusalem and exiled many of its inhabitants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah and Jerusalem, representing a significant threat and source of fear for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reassures His people of His presence and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_presence.htm">Trust in God's Presence</a></b><br>Just as God assured the remnant of Judah of His presence, believers today can trust that God is with them in times of fear and uncertainty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance_from_fear.htm">Deliverance from Fear</a></b><br>The command "Do not be afraid" is a call to faith over fear, reminding us that God is greater than any earthly power or threat.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control, even over powerful rulers and nations, and His plans for His people are for their ultimate good.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_god's_guidance.htm">Seeking God's Guidance</a></b><br>Like the remnant seeking Jeremiah's counsel, we should seek God's guidance through prayer and His Word when facing difficult decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Our faith should lead us to act courageously, knowing that God is our deliverer and protector.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_42_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 42:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_42_11_Trust_God_over_fear.htm">How does Jeremiah 42:11 encourage trust in God's protection over human fears?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jer_42_11_reveal_about_God.htm">What does "do not be afraid" in Jeremiah 42:11 reveal about God's character?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jeremiah_42_11_to_Jesus_on_fear.htm">How can Jeremiah 42:11 be connected to Jesus' teachings on fear and trust?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Jeremiah_42_11_aid_todays_fears.htm">In what ways can we apply Jeremiah 42:11 to modern-day challenges and fears?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_42_11_God_s_sovereignty_hope.htm">How does Jeremiah 42:11 inspire confidence in God's sovereignty during uncertain times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_42_11_God_s_protection_promise.htm">How does Jeremiah 42:11 reflect God's promise of protection despite Israel's disobedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_assure_safety_in_Jer_42_11.htm">Why does God assure safety in Jeremiah 42:11 when the Israelites fear Babylon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Jeremiah_42_11_s_protection.htm">What historical context surrounds Jeremiah 42:11's message of divine protection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_42.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 42?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_jer_42's_promises_conflict_with_jer_43.htm">Do the promises in Jer 42 about the safety of the remnant conflict with the calamities in Jer 43?

Their current fear stems from resisting that prior word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not be afraid of him</b><p>The repetition reinforces the command, turning it from suggestion to settled mandate.<p>&#8226; Double emphasis recalls God&#8217;s charge to Joshua: &#8220;Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The echo invites them to replace rehearsed dread with rehearsed trust (<a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>This phrase guarantees authority and reliability.
