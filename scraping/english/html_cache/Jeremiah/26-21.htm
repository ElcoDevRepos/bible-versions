His reign was marked by a return to idolatry and rebellion against God, contrasting with his father Josiah's reforms. The "mighty men and officials" refer to the king's advisors and military leaders, indicating that Jeremiah's message reached the highest levels of government. This reflects the widespread impact of prophetic messages in ancient Israel, where prophets often addressed not just the common people but also the ruling class. The context here is that Jeremiah's prophecies were challenging the status quo, calling for repentance and warning of impending judgment, which would have been threatening to the king and his court.<p><b>and the king sought to put him to death</b><br>Jehoiakim's reaction to the prophetic message was one of hostility, a common response from leaders who felt threatened by the truth of God's word. This mirrors other biblical accounts where prophets faced persecution for delivering God's messages, such as Elijah with Ahab and Jezebel. The desire to silence the prophet by death underscores the severity of the message and the king's unwillingness to repent. It also highlights the theme of persecution faced by God's messengers throughout scripture, foreshadowing the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who also spoke truth to power.<p><b>But when Uriah found out about it</b><br>Uriah, another prophet, is mentioned here as a contemporary of Jeremiah. His awareness of the king's intentions suggests a network of communication among the prophets and their supporters. This phrase indicates the real danger faced by those who spoke God's truth, as well as the vigilance required to survive in such a hostile environment. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God providing warnings and opportunities for His servants to escape danger, as seen in the lives of figures like David and Paul.<p><b>he fled in fear and went to Egypt</b><br>Egypt was often a place of refuge for those fleeing danger in Israel, as seen in the stories of Jeroboam and later, the Holy Family's flight to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre. Uriah's flight to Egypt signifies a desperate attempt to escape the king's wrath, highlighting the perilous position of prophets during this period. This action also reflects the broader historical context of Egypt as a significant power and a place of asylum, though it was not always a safe haven, as seen in the eventual capture and execution of Uriah. This foreshadows the New Testament account of Jesus' family fleeing to Egypt, drawing a parallel between the persecution of prophets and the early life of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jehoiakim.htm">King Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during Jeremiah's prophetic ministry.

Uriah&#8217;s flight highlights both the high cost of prophetic faithfulness and God&#8217;s provision of temporary refuge. The verse warns that rejecting God&#8217;s word never silences it; it only magnifies the coming judgment, while encouraging believers that the Lord sees and protects those who boldly speak His truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And when Jehoiakim the king . . .</span>--The fact that the princes of Judah, who defended Jeremiah, were against Urijah, suggests the inference either that his words were more vehemently denunciatory, or that he was less fortunate in finding a personal friend and protector like Ahikam.
