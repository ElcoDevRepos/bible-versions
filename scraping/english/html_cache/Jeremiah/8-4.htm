Jeremiah is instructed to deliver God's message directly to the people, highlighting the divine authority behind his words. The phrase underscores the importance of prophetic communication in the Old Testament, where prophets served as intermediaries between God and His people. This is consistent with the role of other prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel, who also conveyed God's messages to Israel.<p><b>Do men fall and not get up again?</b><br>This rhetorical question uses a common human experience to illustrate a spiritual truth. Falling and getting up is a natural part of life, suggesting that recovery and repentance should be expected. The imagery of falling can be connected to sin and moral failure, while getting up symbolizes repentance and restoration. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a>, which states that a righteous man falls seven times and rises again, emphasizing resilience and the possibility of redemption.<p><b>Does one turn away and not return?</b><br>This question addresses the issue of apostasy and the expectation of repentance. Turning away signifies a departure from God and His commandments, while returning implies repentance and reconciliation. The cultural context of ancient Israel involved a covenant relationship with God, where turning away was seen as breaking the covenant. The call to return is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, urging Israel to repent and restore their relationship with God. This idea is also reflected in the parable of the Prodigal Son in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, where the son returns to his father after straying away, symbolizing repentance and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Like <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-18</a>, the prophet&#8217;s duty is to convey God&#8217;s word, not his own ideas. His audience may resist (<a href="/jeremiah/7-27.htm">Jeremiah 7:27</a>), yet the message must still be delivered. The phrase reminds us that God holds His messengers responsible for fidelity, and He holds listeners responsible for response (<a href="/matthew/10-14.htm">Matthew 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the LORD says</b><p>These words anchor the authority of the statement. The prophet is not presenting a suggestion but conveying the voice of the covenant-keeping LORD (<a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-20</a>). Because God cannot lie (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>), what follows carries absolute truth and demands obedience. Scripture&#8217;s reliability is underscored: every word is God-breathed and trustworthy (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Do men fall and not get up again?"</b><p>The question appeals to common sense. In ordinary life, a person who trips instinctively rises. <a href="/proverbs/24-16.htm">Proverbs 24:16</a> notes, &#8220;Though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again,&#8221; and <a href="/micah/7-8.htm">Micah 7:8</a> declares, &#8220;Though I have fallen, I will rise.&#8221; God is asking Judah, &#8220;Why do you remain sprawled in sin when it is natural to stand back up?&#8221; The implication: stubborn refusal to repent is irrational. Like the prodigal son who &#8220;came to his senses&#8221; and rose to go home (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-20</a>), the expected response to a fall is restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Does one turn away and not return?"</b><p>Turning off a path is usually temporary; travelers correct course to reach their destination. Earlier, God pled, &#8220;Return, faithless Israel&#8230;for I am merciful&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>). <a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a> and <a href="/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a> echo the same invitation. By contrast, Judah&#8217;s ongoing apostasy (<a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>) defies reason. The Lord highlights the unnaturalness of persisting in rebellion when the way back is open. New Testament grace affirms the same truth: &#8220;If we confess our sins, He is faithful&#8230;to forgive&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>). God stands ready; the hold-up is human refusal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a> confronts Judah with two everyday illustrations: people who fall normally rise, and travelers who take a wrong turn typically backtrack. God&#8217;s point is simple yet piercing: persisting in sin when restoration is available is irrational. The verse calls listeners of every age to recognize their spiritual stumble, reject stubbornness, and return promptly to the Lord who always welcomes repentant hearts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Shall he turn.</span>--Better, as both clauses arc indefinite, <span class= "ital">Shall men fall and not arise? Shall one turn away and not return? </span>The appeal is made to the common practice of men. Those who fall struggle to their feet again. One who finds that he has lost his way retraces his steps. In its spiritual aspect the words assert the possibility of repentance in all but every case, however desperate it may seem. St. Paul's question, "Have they stumbled that they should fall?" (<a href="/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.">Romans 11:11</a>), expresses something of the same belief in the ultimate triumph of the Divine purpose of good. As yet, that purpose, as the next verse shows, seemed to be thwarted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4</span> - <a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a>. - The incorrigible wickedness of the people, and the awfulness of the judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover thou shalt say</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and thou shalt say</span>.
