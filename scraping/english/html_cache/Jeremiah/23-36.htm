False prophets in Jeremiah's time were misusing this term to lend authority to their own words, which were not from God. This misuse led to confusion and misrepresentation of God's true message. The command to stop using this phrase highlights the seriousness of speaking falsely in God's name. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of truth in prophecy, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where false prophecy is condemned.<p><b>for each man&#8217;s word becomes the burden</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to individual responsibility. The false prophets were creating their own "burdens" or messages, which were not from God. This phrase underscores the danger of human words being elevated to divine status, leading to spiritual deception. It echoes the warning in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a> about false teachers introducing destructive heresies. The emphasis is on the need for discernment and adherence to God's true word.<p><b>so that you pervert the words of the living God</b><br>The term "pervert" indicates a twisting or distortion of God's message. This is a serious accusation, as it implies a deliberate alteration of divine truth. The "living God" emphasizes God's active and dynamic presence, contrasting with the lifeless idols of surrounding nations. This distortion is akin to the sin of the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1-5</a>, where God's words were twisted to deceive. It serves as a warning against altering Scripture to fit personal agendas.<p><b>the LORD of Hosts</b><br>This title for God, "LORD of Hosts," signifies His supreme authority over all heavenly and earthly armies. It underscores His power and sovereignty, reinforcing the gravity of misrepresenting His words. This title is frequently used in prophetic literature to remind the audience of God's ultimate control and the futility of opposing His will. It connects to passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where God's holiness and majesty are proclaimed.<p><b>our God</b><br>The phrase "our God" personalizes the relationship between God and His people, emphasizing covenantal faithfulness. It serves as a reminder of the unique bond between God and Israel, established through the covenants with Abraham, Moses, and David. This relationship is central to understanding the expectations of faithfulness and obedience. It also points forward to the New Covenant in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>, where God promises to be the God of His people, writing His laws on their hearts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often the focus of Jeremiah's prophecies due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Jeremiah's time who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages contrary to His true word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oracle_of_the_lord.htm">The Oracle of the LORD</a></b><br>A term used to describe a divine message or prophecy, which was being misused by the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_false_teachings.htm">Guarding Against False Teachings</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant in discerning true teachings from false ones, ensuring that they align with Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_authority_of_god's_word.htm">The Authority of God's Word</a></b><br>God's Word is the ultimate authority, and personal interpretations or distortions must be avoided to maintain its purity and truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_speaking_for_god.htm">The Responsibility of Speaking for God</a></b><br>Those who claim to speak on behalf of God bear a significant responsibility to ensure their words are truly His and not their own.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_distortion.htm">The Danger of Distortion</a></b><br>Distorting God's Word can lead to spiritual harm and misguidance, emphasizing the need for careful study and understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_name_and_message.htm">Reverence for God's Name and Message</a></b><br>Using God's name or message flippantly or inaccurately shows a lack of reverence and can lead to judgment.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_23_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 23:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_23_36_misuse_God_s_word.htm">How does Jeremiah 23:36 warn against misusing God's word in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_perverted_the_words.htm">What does "perverted the words" mean in the context of Jeremiah 23:36?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Align_teachings_with_Jeremiah_23_36.htm">How can we ensure our teachings align with God's truth in Jeremiah 23:36?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_texts_on_handling_God_s_word.htm">What other scriptures emphasize the importance of accurately handling God's word?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Guard_against_false_teachings_2.htm">How can we guard against false teachings as warned in Jeremiah 23:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_perverting_God_s_words.htm">What does Jeremiah 23:36 mean by "perverting the words of the living God"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_23_36_vs_false_prophets.htm">How does Jeremiah 23:36 challenge the authority of false prophets?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Jeremiah_23_36_s_context_key.htm">Why is the context of Jeremiah 23:36 important for understanding its message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_23.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_bible_edits_with_jer._23_36.htm">Jeremiah 23:36: How can the warning against perverting &#8220;the words of the living God&#8221; be reconciled with claims that the Bible has been edited or redacted over time?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_king_jehoiakim.htm">Who was King Jehoiakim in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_burn_a_scroll,_not_tablets,_in_jer._36_23.htm">Why does Jeremiah 36 focus on burning a scroll instead of tablets or other writing materials, and could this reflect an anachronistic portrayal of ancient record-keeping?

God now forbids its use because it no longer points to Him. It had become a spiritual catch-phrase masking rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/23-33.htm">Jeremiah 23:33&#8211;34</a>). He is effectively saying, &#8220;Stop claiming My authority for your inventions.&#8221; Similar correction appears when Jesus warns against using pious words to cloak empty religion (&#8220;And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commands of men,&#8221; <a href="/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>).<p>&#8226; True prophecy always carries God&#8217;s weight, yet it also brings His hope (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Counterfeit prophecy burdens people with fear while excusing sin (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for each man&#8217;s word becomes the burden</b><p>When God&#8217;s voice is ignored, human opinions rush in.
