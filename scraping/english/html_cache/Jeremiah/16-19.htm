In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, God is portrayed as a stronghold amidst the impending Babylonian invasion. The imagery of God as a fortress is common in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), highlighting His reliability and defense against adversaries. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of deities as protectors of their people.<p><b>my refuge in the day of distress</b><br>Jeremiah often faced persecution and hardship, making the concept of God as a refuge particularly poignant. The "day of distress" refers to times of trouble, which in Jeremiah's context includes the Babylonian threat and the spiritual decline of Judah. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God as a refuge in times of trouble, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>.<p><b>the nations will come to You from the ends of the earth</b><br>This anticipates a future time when Gentiles will recognize the God of Israel. It aligns with prophecies in Isaiah (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>) about nations streaming to God's mountain. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of the gospel reaching all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), indicating the universal scope of God's salvation plan.<p><b>and they will say, &#8220;Our fathers inherited nothing but lies</b><br>This confession by the nations acknowledges the futility of their ancestral beliefs. It reflects a turning point where the truth of God is recognized over the falsehoods of idolatry. This theme of inherited falsehoods is also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/20-18.htm">Ezekiel 20:18</a>, where God warns against following the sinful practices of previous generations.<p><b>worthless idols of no benefit at all</b><br>The critique of idols is a recurring theme in Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>). Idols are described as powerless and futile, contrasting with the living God. This reflects the biblical condemnation of idolatry, which is seen as a betrayal of the covenant relationship with God. The New Testament continues this theme, emphasizing the futility of idols in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment due to their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, depicted as a source of strength, protection, and refuge for His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Gentile nations who, in the future, will recognize the futility of their idolatry and turn to the true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fathers.htm">The Fathers</a></b><br>Ancestors of the nations who passed down traditions and beliefs centered around false gods and idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/worthless_idols.htm">Worthless Idols</a></b><br>The false gods worshiped by the nations, which are described as lies and of no benefit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_our_refuge.htm">God as Our Refuge</a></b><br>In times of distress, believers can find strength and protection in God, who is our fortress and refuge.

At the same time, the verse points to a literal fulfillment when Gentile nations abandon idols and stream to worship the God of Israel. Thus, Jeremiah both comforts the individual heart in present distress and broadens the horizon to a coming global revival, all resting on the unchanging character of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">O Lord, my strength, and my fortress.</span>--The words speak of a returning confidence in the prophet's mind, and find utterance in what is practically (though the Hebrew words are not the same) an echo of <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm" title="The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.">Psalm 18:2</a>, or more closely of <a href="/psalms/28-1.htm" title="To you will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if you be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-8.htm" title="The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.">Psalm 28:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-17.htm" title="To you, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defense, and the God of my mercy.">Psalm 59:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-3.htm" title="The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.">2Samuel 22:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The Gentiles shall come unto thee.</span>--The sin and folly of Israel are painted in contrast with the prophet's vision of the future.

Israel had answered in the affirmative the question which seemed to admit only of an answer in the negative: "Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?" . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, my strength, and my fortress</span>, etc. Jeremiah falls into the tone of the psalmists (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/28-8.htm">Psalm 28:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/59-17.htm">Psalm 59:17</a>).
