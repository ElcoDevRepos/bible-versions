Their presence indicates that not all of the king's advisors supported his actions. Elnathan is mentioned elsewhere as a royal official (<a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>), suggesting he had some influence. Delaiah and Gemariah are less prominent but are noted here for their opposition to the king's decision. This phrase highlights the presence of a remnant within the leadership who respected God's word, reflecting the biblical theme of a faithful remnant (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). The scroll they urged the king not to burn contained the words of Jeremiah, which were a direct message from God. This act of urging the king shows their recognition of the divine authority of the prophetic word, a theme consistent throughout Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><b>he would not listen to them</b><br>King Jehoiakim's refusal to heed the advice of his officials demonstrates his hardened heart and rejection of God's message. This is consistent with his overall character as depicted in the Bible, where he is shown as a king who did evil in the sight of the Lord (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36-37</a>). His actions are reminiscent of Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus, where despite numerous warnings, he refused to listen to God's commands (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>). This phrase underscores the theme of human rebellion against divine authority, a recurring motif in the prophetic books. Jehoiakim's refusal to listen also foreshadows the eventual judgment that would come upon Judah, as prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elnathan.htm">Elnathan</a></b><br>A court official during the reign of King Jehoiakim.
