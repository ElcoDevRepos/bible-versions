The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from the covenantal unfaithfulness of His people. This anger is not arbitrary but is a response to the violation of the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The prophets, including Jeremiah, repeatedly warned of the consequences of such disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-7</a>). The anger of the LORD is also seen in other instances, such as the destruction of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18-23</a>).<p><b>all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah</b><br>The phrase "all this" refers to the calamities that befell Jerusalem and Judah, including the siege, destruction, and exile. Jerusalem, the capital city, held the temple, the center of Jewish worship, making its fall particularly significant. Judah, the southern kingdom, was the remnant of the once-united Israelite monarchy. The historical context includes the Babylonian invasions, which culminated in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Archaeological evidence, such as the Babylonian Chronicles, corroborates the biblical account of these events.<p><b>until He finally banished them from His presence</b><br>This banishment signifies the exile of the Jewish people to Babylon, a pivotal event in Jewish history. Being banished from God's presence implies a loss of the land, the temple, and the direct blessings associated with God's covenant. Theologically, it represents a severe consequence of breaking the covenant. The exile fulfilled prophecies given by earlier prophets, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>) and Jeremiah himself (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). The concept of being away from God's presence is echoed in the New Testament, where separation from God is a consequence of sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon</b><br>Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, was placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, but later rebelled against him. This rebellion is documented in <a href="/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>. Zedekiah's rebellion was politically motivated but spiritually misguided, as it went against the prophetic counsel of Jeremiah, who advised submission to Babylon as God's instrument of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12-15</a>). The rebellion led to the final siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Zedekiah's actions can be seen as a type of human defiance against divine will, contrasting with the obedience of Christ, who submitted to the Father's will even unto death (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against Jerusalem and Judah due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_and_judah.htm">Jerusalem and Judah</a></b><br>The capital city and the southern kingdom of Israel, respectively, which faced divine judgment and eventual exile due to their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the final siege of Jerusalem by Babylon.

Centuries of idolatry, injustice, and rejection of the prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/25-3.htm">Jeremiah 25:3&#8211;7</a>) fueled this anger; judgment was not sudden but patiently delayed.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s anger is never capricious;
