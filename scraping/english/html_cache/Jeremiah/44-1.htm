This phrase indicates divine revelation, a common occurrence in Jeremiah's ministry, emphasizing the authority and authenticity of the message. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people, often calling them to repentance and warning of impending judgment.<p><b>concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt</b><br>After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Jews fled to Egypt for refuge, despite Jeremiah's warnings against doing so (<a href="/jeremiah/42-13.htm">Jeremiah 42:13-19</a>). This phrase highlights the disobedience of the remnant who sought safety in Egypt rather than trusting in God's plan. Egypt, historically a place of bondage for the Israelites, symbolizes a return to reliance on human strength rather than divine guidance.<p><b>in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis</b><br>These locations were significant cities in ancient Egypt. Migdol was a fortress city, Tahpanhes (also known as Daphnae) was a major settlement where Jeremiah himself was taken (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7-9</a>), and Memphis was a prominent cultural and religious center. The mention of these cities indicates the widespread dispersion of the Jewish community in Egypt and their integration into Egyptian society, which posed a risk of adopting pagan practices.<p><b>and in the land of Pathros</b><br>Pathros refers to Upper Egypt, the southern region of the country. This area was known for its ancient civilization and religious practices. The inclusion of Pathros suggests that the Jewish presence in Egypt was extensive, reaching even into the heart of Egyptian culture. This dispersion reflects the fulfillment of God's warnings about the consequences of disobedience and the scattering of His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>).<br><br>This verse sets the stage for the subsequent message of judgment and calls to repentance, as God addresses the idolatry and unfaithfulness of His people in a foreign land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews_in_egypt.htm">The Jews in Egypt</a></b><br>These are the remnants of Judah who fled to Egypt after the fall of Jerusalem, despite God's command to remain in the land of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/migdol,_tahpanhes,_memphis,_and_pathros.htm">Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and Pathros</a></b><br>Locations in Egypt where the Jewish exiles settled.

It appears in the <span class= "ital">Itinerary </span>of Antoninus, under the name <span class= "ital">Magdolo, </span>as twelve miles south of Pelusium. The latter is thought by Lepsius to be different from the former, and to answer to the <span class= "ital">Stratopeda </span>or "camp" which Herodotus mentions as having been founded by Psammetichus I. as a settlement for his Ionian or Carian mercenaries (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible, </span>Art. <span class= "ital">Migdol</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Noph was identical with Memphis, and appears in <a href="/isaiah/19-13.htm" title="The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.">Isaiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-16.htm" title="Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of your head.">Jeremiah 2:16</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-13.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 30:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/30-16.htm" title="And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Noph shall have distresses daily.">Ezekiel 30:16</a> : and as Moph in the Hebrew of <a href="/hosea/9-6.htm" title="For, see, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tabernacles.">Hosea 9:6</a>. The position of Pathros is less certain, but it may be inferred from the mention of the other cities with it that it was in Lower Egypt, and possibly, from <a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm" title="Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelled in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,">Jeremiah 44:15</a>, that it was the name of the region in which it was situated. So in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>, it appears in conjunction with Mizraim (= Egypt) and Cush (= Ethiopia), both of which are names of regions and not of cities. By Brugsch (<span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>I. 242) it has been identified with Upper Egypt, the region of the Thebaid. There is no certain note of the interval between the arrival of the Jews in Egypt and the delivery of the discourse, but it would appear that there had been time for the Jews to disperse and settle in the three or four cities here named, and to adopt the worship of the Egyptians. It is, however, implied throughout that the prophet is speaking to the emigrants themselves, and not to their descendants (<a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-21.htm" title="The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?">Jeremiah 44:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - Accusation brought against the obstinately idolatrous people. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which dwell;</span> rather, <span class="accented">which dwelt.</span> It appears from this verse that the Jewish fugitives had separated in Egypt, some going to the two northern frontier cities, Migdol (on which see R.S.
