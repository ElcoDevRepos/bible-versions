Throughout the book of Jeremiah, the phrase "the word of the LORD" is a recurring theme, highlighting the authority and authenticity of the prophetic message. This divine communication is consistent with the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament, where prophets receive direct revelations from God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>).<p><b>after Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had released him at Ramah</b><br>Nebuzaradan was a high-ranking Babylonian official, the captain of the guard, responsible for overseeing the deportation of the Jewish captives. His actions reflect the fulfillment of God's judgment on Judah due to their persistent disobedience. Ramah, located near Jerusalem, served as a staging area for the exiles before their journey to Babylon. This location is significant in biblical history, as it was also the site where Rachel wept for her children (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), symbolizing the sorrow of exile.<p><b>having found him bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah</b><br>Jeremiah, though a prophet of God, was initially treated like the other captives, bound in chains. This reflects the indiscriminate nature of the Babylonian conquest and the suffering endured by the people of Judah. Jeremiah's experience parallels that of Jesus Christ, who, despite His innocence, was bound and led away (<a href="/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>). The prophet's release signifies God's providential care and the fulfillment of His promise to protect Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>).<p><b>who were being exiled to Babylon</b><br>The exile to Babylon was a pivotal event in Jewish history, marking the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity. This period was a direct consequence of Judah's unfaithfulness to the covenant with God, as prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). The exile served as both punishment and purification, ultimately leading to a renewed commitment to God upon the return to the land. The Babylonian Captivity is also a type of spiritual exile, representing the separation from God due to sin, with the promise of restoration through repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who delivered messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

It is a natural conclusion that it stands as a kind of heading to the section of the collected prophecies subsequent to the capture of the city.<p><span class= "bld">Had let him go from Ramah.</span>--The town so named was in the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm" title="Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,">Joshua 18:25</a>), about six miles from Jerusalem, and retains its old name in the form <span class= "ital">Er-Ram. </span>It was used on this occasion as a depot for the prisoners who were brought to it from Jerusalem, to await the orders of Nebuzaradan as to their ultimate disposal. The captain of the guard and the prophet had apparently not met before, and the latter had been brought in chains (literally, <span class= "ital">manacles, </span>chains fastened to the wrists, <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm" title="And now, behold, I loose you this day from the chains which were on your hand. If it seem good to you to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to you: but if it seem ill to you to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before you: where it seems good and convenient for you to go, thither go.">Jeremiah 40:4</a>), like the other captives.<p>(2?4) <span class= "bld">The Lord thy God . . .</span>--It is significant that the Chaldaean general speaks as if recognising Jehovah as the God of Israel, and the prophet's mission from Him. Such a recognition did not, however, imply more than the belief of the polytheist, that each nation had its own guardian deity. We find language of a like kind, though spoken with a tone of sarcasm, coming even from the lips of Rab-shakeh (<a href="/2_kings/18-25.htm" title="Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.">2Kings 18:25</a>). As a prophet, however, Jeremiah is treated with marked respect--in part, perhaps, due to the policy he had advocated; in part, possibly, to the influence of men like Daniel and his friends at Babylon--and offered the option of going, with the promise of honourable treatment. to that city, from which, however, it is assumed, that he would not return, or remaining in Judaea, to <span class= "ital">go </span>where he will. The prophet obviously chooses the second alternative, but before he acts on it another plan occurs to Nebuzar-adan. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - The liberation of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word that came to Jeremiah.</span> The formula seems to announce a prophecy; but no prophecy follows. It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that "the word" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see <a href="/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the "word," or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. <span class="cmt_word">Had let him go from Ramah.</span> Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in <a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the "court of the watch," and the writer of <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a> simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">In chains.</span> See ver. 4, "The chains which were upon thine hand." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
