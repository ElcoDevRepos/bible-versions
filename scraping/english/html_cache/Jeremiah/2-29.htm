The Israelites are depicted as bringing a lawsuit against God, questioning His actions or perceived inaction. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God is the suzerain and Israel the vassal. The Israelites' complaints may stem from their suffering or perceived injustices, yet God challenges their right to question Him, given their own unfaithfulness. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's justice and the people's accountability, as seen in <a href="/job/40-2.htm">Job 40:2</a>, where God questions Job's right to contend with Him.<p><b>You have all rebelled against Me,&#8221;</b><br>The rebellion of Israel is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. This phrase underscores the collective nature of Israel's sin, indicating that the rebellion is not isolated to a few individuals but is widespread among the people. Historically, this rebellion can be seen in their idolatry, social injustices, and failure to uphold the covenant. The use of "all" emphasizes the totality of their disobedience, reminiscent of the collective sin of humanity described in <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>. This rebellion is not just a breach of law but a personal affront to God, who desires a relationship with His people.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" is a prophetic formula that asserts the authority and authenticity of the message. It signifies that the words spoken are not merely the prophet's but are directly from God. This divine declaration is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His right to judge His people. The use of God's covenant name, often rendered as "LORD" in English translations, emphasizes His eternal and unchanging nature, as well as His faithfulness to His promises, despite Israel's unfaithfulness. This is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where the authority of the message is rooted in its divine origin, as seen in similar declarations throughout the books of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Yet God&#8217;s record is clear. Earlier in the chapter He recounts how He planted Israel &#8220;like a choice vine&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>) and led them safely through the wilderness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes misplaced blame. Instead of examining their own conduct, the people shift fault onto God. This mirrors Adam&#8217;s deflection in <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a> and the later complaints of Israel in <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2&#8211;3</a>.<p>&#8226; By asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; the Lord invites honest reflection. He is not on trial; His faithfulness is beyond dispute (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The issue is Israel&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the obvious: their suffering flows from abandoning the covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have all rebelled against Me,</b> declares the LORD<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s verdict follows instantly: rebellion is universal&#8212;&#8220;all.&#8221; Like <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>, no one can claim innocence. Even the priests, rulers, and prophets are indicted in the surrounding verses (<a href="/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebellion is not merely passive drifting but active resistance. Verse 27 shows them turning to carved images, saying, &#8220;You are my father.&#8221; This recalls <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, where Samuel equates rebellion with witchcraft&#8212;willful, entrenched sin.<p>&#8226; The declaration ends debate. Divine authority settles the matter (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>). God exposes sin so He can call His people back: &#8220;Return, faithless Israel&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>). Restoration is available, but only after admitting guilt (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/2-29.htm">Jeremiah 2:29</a> records God&#8217;s incredulous question and decisive verdict. Israel&#8217;s complaints cannot stand because God has been consistently faithful. The real issue is their collective rebellion&#8212;an active, covenant-breaking defiance. By spotlighting misplaced blame and universal sin, the Lord urges His people to stop arguing their innocence, face the truth, and return to Him, the only righteous Judge and Redeemer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Wherefore will ye plead with me?</span>--The reply of the accuser to the false pleas of the accused.
