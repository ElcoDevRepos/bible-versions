In biblical context, the "heart" often represents the center of human will and emotion. This aligns with <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The heart's condition is crucial in determining one's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which advises guarding the heart diligently.<p><b>I examine the mind</b><br>The "mind" here refers to the inner workings of human thought and reasoning. This examination by God highlights His role as the ultimate judge of human motives and intentions. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> supports this by describing the Word of God as discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. The dual focus on heart and mind underscores the comprehensive nature of God's judgment.<p><b>to reward a man according to his way,</b><br>This phrase indicates that God&#8217;s judgment is based on the moral and ethical paths individuals choose. "His way" refers to the overall conduct and lifestyle of a person. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which warns that a way that seems right to a person can lead to death, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's way with God's will. The idea of divine recompense is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, which states that a person reaps what they sow.<p><b>by what his deeds deserve.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the principle of divine justice, where actions have consequences. It reflects the biblical teaching that God is just and will reward or punish individuals based on their actions. This is consistent with the message in <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, which states that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." The emphasis on deeds also points to the importance of living a life that reflects one's faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>, which asserts that faith without works is dead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is portrayed as omniscient and just, searching the hearts and minds of individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the people of Judah, warning them of their idolatry and calling them to repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_and_mind.htm">The Heart and Mind</a></b><br>Symbolic of the inner being of a person, encompassing thoughts, intentions, and desires.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reward_and_deeds.htm">Reward and Deeds</a></b><br>The concept of divine justice, where God evaluates and responds to human actions based on their moral and spiritual quality.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>God knows our innermost thoughts and intentions.
