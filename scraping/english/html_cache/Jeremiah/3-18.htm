It is a prophetic term indicating a period when God will act decisively in history, often associated with the Messianic age or the end times.<p><b>the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel</b><br>Historically, the kingdoms of Judah and Israel were divided after the reign of Solomon. This prophecy envisions a reunification of the two houses, symbolizing healing and restoration. It reflects God's desire for unity among His people and foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Christ, who unites all believers.<p><b>and they will come together from the land of the north</b><br>The "land of the north" likely refers to the regions where the Israelites were exiled, such as Assyria and Babylon. This indicates a return from captivity, a theme prevalent in prophetic literature. It also symbolizes spiritual return and renewal, as God gathers His people from places of dispersion.<p><b>to the land that I gave to your fathers as an inheritance</b><br>This refers to the Promised Land, given to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. The land is not just a physical territory but represents God's blessing and the fulfillment of His promises.

Observe, Israel is converted first, then Judah. This detail in the prophecy is not to be pressed. Not that the force of any prophecy is to be evaded, but that in this case the form of the statement is so clearly conditioned by the abounding sympathy of the prophet for the ten tribes. These had been so long languishing in captivity that they needed a special premise. The form of the promise is imaginative; this seems clearly to follow from the fact that in no other passage (except, indeed, <a href="/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>) is there a reference to the spiritual primacy of Etihraim in the restored nation. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the land of the north</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.
