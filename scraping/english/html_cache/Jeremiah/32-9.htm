Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin, was Jeremiah's hometown. This act occurs during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, a time when buying land would seem illogical due to the impending destruction. However, it demonstrates Jeremiah's trust in God's promise of restoration for Israel. This act is a prophetic sign that, despite the current judgment, God will bring His people back to the land.<p><b>from my cousin Hanamel</b><br>The mention of Hanamel, Jeremiah's cousin, highlights the practice of the right of redemption, where family members had the responsibility to keep property within the family. This reflects the Levitical law found in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>, which emphasizes the importance of family and land inheritance in Israelite culture. Jeremiah's obedience to this law, even in dire circumstances, underscores his commitment to God's commands and the hope of future restoration.<p><b>and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver</b><br>The act of weighing out silver indicates a formal and legal transaction, adhering to the customs of the time. Seventeen shekels of silver, though a modest amount, signifies the seriousness of the purchase. This transaction is a testament to Jeremiah's faith in God's promises, as he invests in a future that seems impossible. The use of silver, a common currency, also connects to other biblical transactions, such as the purchase of the cave of Machpelah by Abraham (<a href="/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>), reinforcing themes of faith and covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The verse therefore stands as a call to trust the LORD&#8217;s promises, obey His Word, and invest in His future&#8212;no matter how bleak the present appears.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</span>--The Hebrew presents the singular combination, <span class= "ital">seven shekels and ten </span>[<span class= "ital">pieces of</span>]<span class= "ital"> silver, </span>and is followed by the LXX. and Vulg. There is no ground for thinking that there is any difference between the coins or bullion so described, and the formula was probably one of the technicalities of Jewish conveyancing. As regards the price it is not easy, in the absence of any measurement of the field, to form an estimate of its value; but, speaking roughly, as compared with the four hundred shekels paid by Abraham for the field of Ephron (<a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>), or the fifty paid by David for the threshing-floor and oxen of Araunah (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.">2Samuel 24:24</a>; in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1Chronicles 21:25</a> the price is fixed at six hundred shekels of gold), or to the thirty shekels paid for the potter's field in <a href="/matthew/27-9.htm" title="Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;">Matthew 27:9</a>, or to the market price of a slave varying from fifteen (<a href="/hosea/3-2.htm" title="So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:">Hosea 3:2</a>) to thirty shekels (<a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm" title="And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.">Zechariah 11:12</a>), the price, under 2 sterling, would seem to have been far below its average market value, and in this respect the story falls short of the dignity of its Roman parallel (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/32-7.htm" title="Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you saying, Buy you my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is your to buy it.">Jeremiah 32:7</a>). Hanameel, as said above, was probably glad to part with it at any price. It is possible, however, that the smallness of the sum was owing to the fact that the sale, as above suggested, conveyed possession only for the unexpired term of a tenancy which was to end with the next year of Jubilee. On that assumption the prophet's motive in purchasing may have been to keep it in the family instead of letting it pass to a stranger who might be unwilling to surrender it when the year of Jubilee arrived. As the prophet was unmarried he had no son to inherit it. The precise sum fixed, perhaps even the form in which the sum is stated, may have originated in Jeremiah's wish to connect in this way the two numbers, ten and seven, which when multiplied together produced the number which he had fixed for the years of captivity, and therefore for the term of restoration. Such an elaborate artifice of symbolism would, at least, be quite in character in a prophet who adopts the acrostic form in his Lamentations and the cypher of an inverted alphabet known as the <span class= "ital">Athbash. </span>(See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/25-26.htm" title="And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.">Jeremiah 25:26</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Seventeen shekels of silver; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about &pound;2 5<span class="accented">s</span>. 4<span class="accented">d</span>. (taking the shekel at 2<span class="accented">s</span>. 8<span class="accented">d.</span>). This has been thought a small price. Thirty shekels were paid for the potter's field (<a href="/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a>); fifty by David, for Araunah's threshing floor and oxen (<a href="/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a>). The Hebrew has "seven shekels and ten of silver;" hence the Targum increases the price by supplying "minas" before "of silver," bringing up the sum to one hundred and seven shekels. This, however, seems too much. Even if Jeremiah wished to be liberal, he would hardly have been able to go so far (probably) in excess of the market price. Who would have purchased the land on speculation, if Jeremiah had refused? The famine made life, the siege, a continuance of personal liberty, terribly uncertain. And, putting this out of the question, there may have been but a short time to elapse before the year of jubilee, when the land would revert to its original occupant (see above). The singular form of expression in the Hebrew, at which the Targum stumbled, may, perhaps, be the usual style of legal documents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I bought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
