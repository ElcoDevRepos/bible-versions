Mizpah, a significant location in Benjamin, served as a center of administration after Jerusalem's fall. This private conversation indicates the sensitive nature of the topic, reflecting the political tension and instability following the Babylonian conquest.<p><b>&#8220;Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah,&#8221; he said.</b><br>Ishmael, of royal lineage, posed a threat to Gedaliah's leadership.

The scattering of the people would further weaken the already diminished community.<p><b>so that the remnant of Judah would perish?&#8221;</b><br>The remnant refers to those who survived the Babylonian conquest and exile.
