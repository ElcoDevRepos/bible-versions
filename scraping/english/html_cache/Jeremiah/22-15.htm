The rhetorical question challenges the notion that material wealth and opulence define true leadership. In the ancient Near East, cedar was a symbol of power and prestige, often imported from Lebanon. The prophet Jeremiah critiques King Jehoiakim's focus on lavishness rather than the qualities that truly define a righteous king. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God values justice and righteousness over external appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>Did not your father have food and drink?</b><br>This phrase refers to King Josiah, Jehoiakim's father, who is remembered for his piety and reforms (2 Kings 22-23). The mention of "food and drink" symbolizes basic needs and contentment, suggesting that Josiah's reign was marked by sufficiency and satisfaction without excessive luxury. Josiah's focus was on spiritual and moral reform rather than material excess, aligning with the covenantal values of the Torah. This serves as a reminder that true prosperity comes from faithfulness to God's commands rather than indulgence in wealth.<p><b>He administered justice and righteousness,</b><br>Josiah's administration is highlighted for its commitment to justice and righteousness, key themes in the prophetic literature (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). These qualities are central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing the king's role as a shepherd of the people, ensuring fairness and protection for the vulnerable (<a href="/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72:1-4</a>). The administration of justice and righteousness is a reflection of God's own character and is a requirement for leaders in Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical principle that leadership is validated by moral integrity and social responsibility.<p><b>and so it went well with him.</b><br>The positive outcome of Josiah's reign is attributed to his adherence to justice and righteousness. This reflects the Deuteronomic principle of blessings for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). Josiah's reforms and his dedication to the covenant brought peace and stability to the kingdom, demonstrating the connection between righteous leadership and national well-being. This serves as a prophetic warning to Jehoiakim and future leaders that prosperity is contingent upon faithfulness to God's standards, not merely political or economic strategies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during the time of Jeremiah's prophecy.

A various reading, followed by the LXX., gives, "thou viest with Ahaz," or "Ahab," probably, in this latter case, with reference to the ivory palace built by that king (<a href="/1_kings/22-39.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">1Kings 22:39</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Did not thy father eat and drink . . .?</span>--The words are obviously those of praise, and paint a healthy, blameless enjoyment like that of <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm" title="There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; like those, we may add, which the Son of Man used to describe the outward portion of His own life (<a href="/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>). Josiah was not an ascetic, devotee king, but lived his life happily, and did his work--the true kingly work of judgment and justice--well. There was a truer greatness in that than in the stateliness of Jehoiakim's palaces. "Then it was well with him" s repeated with the emphasis of iteration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou reign</span> - rather, dost <span class="accented">thou reign</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dost thou prove thy royal qualities) - <span class="cmt_word">because thou closest thyself in cedar</span>? The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, "because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out "in cedar," as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, "Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, "because thou viest with Ahaz" (so the Vatican Codex), or, "... with Ahab" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (<a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (<a href="/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did not thy father eat and drink?</span> There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. "Eating and drinking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (<a href="/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded.
