This phrase underscores the prophet's confidence in his divine commission and the truth of his words, reflecting the biblical theme of prophetic authority.<p><b>that if you put me to death</b><br>Jeremiah warns of the consequences of executing him, a prophet of God. This echoes the biblical principle that harming God's messengers brings judgment. Historically, prophets often faced persecution, as seen with Elijah and later with John the Baptist and Jesus.<p><b>you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves</b><br>The concept of "innocent blood" is significant in biblical law, where shedding innocent blood is a grave sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>). Jeremiah's warning highlights the moral and spiritual consequences of unjust actions, aligning with the broader biblical theme of justice.<p><b>upon this city</b><br>Jeremiah's warning extends to Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Israel. The city's fate is often tied to the people's obedience to God, as seen in the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC due to persistent disobedience.<p><b>and upon its residents</b><br>The collective responsibility of the city's inhabitants is emphasized. This reflects the biblical idea that communities share in the consequences of their leaders' and individuals' actions, as seen in the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>for truly the LORD has sent me</b><br>Jeremiah reaffirms his divine commission, emphasizing that his message is not self-originated but from God. This is a common theme among prophets, who often faced skepticism and hostility, as seen in the ministries of Moses and Isaiah.<p><b>to speak all these words in your hearing</b><br>The phrase underscores the importance of public proclamation and accountability. Jeremiah's role as a prophet is to deliver God's message openly, ensuring that the people are aware of God's will and cannot claim ignorance, similar to the role of Jesus in His public ministry.<div
