This location was within the palace complex, indicating that Jeremiah was under close watch but not in a dungeon. His imprisonment was due to his prophecies against Jerusalem, which were unpopular with the ruling authorities. This setting highlights the cost of prophetic ministry and the opposition faced by those who speak God's truth. It also parallels other biblical figures who were imprisoned for their faith, such as Joseph in Egypt and Paul in the New Testament.<p><b>the word of the LORD had come to him:</b><br>Despite Jeremiah's physical confinement, God's word was not hindered. This phrase emphasizes the sovereignty and omnipresence of God, who can reach His servants regardless of their circumstances. It underscores the prophetic nature of Jeremiah's ministry, as he received direct revelation from God. This divine communication is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's word comes to His prophets to guide, warn, or comfort His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate revelation of God's word through Jesus Christ, who is described as the Word made flesh in the Gospel of John.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Israelites.

Earlier, <a href="/jeremiah/32-2.htm">Jeremiah 32:2 and 38</a>:6&#8211;13 report that Zedekiah had locked him up for predicting Babylon&#8217;s victory. Yet notice how God&#8217;s servants often meet opposition when they refuse to soften divine warnings&#8212;think of Micaiah in <a href="/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26&#8211;27</a> or Peter and John in <a href="/acts/4-18.htm">Acts 4:18&#8211;20</a>. The verse underscores: personal hardship does not cancel divine calling.<p>Key thoughts<p>&#8226; Confinement highlights Jeremiah&#8217;s faithfulness; he is suffering for obedience, not disobedience (cf. <a href="/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people can be marginalized by earthly powers, but their message remains indispensable (<a href="/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical chains never negate spiritual liberty (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the courtyard of the guard</b><p>This location, the royal palace courtyard turned holding cell, puts Jeremiah close to the king yet under guard (<a href="/jeremiah/38-13.htm">Jeremiah 38:13</a>). Ironically, the palace&#8217;s &#8220;safe&#8221; place becomes the stage for God&#8217;s unfiltered word. Being in public view means witnesses can later confirm what he hears and speaks (compare Paul in <a href="/acts/28-16.htm">Acts 28:16&#8211;31</a>).<p>Why the detail matters<p>&#8226; God situates His messenger where both palace officials and commoners can observe his integrity (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The courtyard setting fulfills earlier assurance that Jeremiah would &#8220;stand before the king&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; It foreshadows the protection God grants despite captivity&#8212;Jer 39:14 shows the same courtyard becoming the place of his release.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD had come to him</b><p>Bars cannot block God&#8217;s voice. Just as previous revelations came &#8220;while he was still confined&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1&#8211;3</a>), so now the Lord prepares Jeremiah to encourage Ebed-Melech (<a href="/jeremiah/39-16.htm">Jeremiah 39:16&#8211;18</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows God initiating: &#8220;The word of the LORD came to Ezekiel&#8221; among exiles (<a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>); &#8220;The Lord stood near Paul&#8221; in a barracks (<a href="/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>). Here the phrase emphasizes:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;He speaks when He chooses, not when circumstances seem favorable.<p>&#8226; The reliability of revelation&#8212;every prophecy made from captivity has already proved true (<a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Hope for the faithful&#8212;if God&#8217;s word reached Jeremiah behind walls, it reaches believers in any trial (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;12</a>).<p>Practical takeaways<p>&#8211; Your environment cannot silence God&#8217;s promises.<p>&#8211; Obedience positions you to receive fresh direction even in adversity.<p>&#8211; God often uses our lowest moments to deliver messages of rescue to others (<a href="/jeremiah/39-17.htm">Jeremiah 39:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/39-15.htm">Jeremiah 39:15</a> teaches that confinement does not hinder communion with God.
