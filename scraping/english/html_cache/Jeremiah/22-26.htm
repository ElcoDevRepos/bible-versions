The context is a prophecy against King Jehoiachin (also known as Coniah), who reigned in Judah. The mention of the mother highlights the complete removal of the royal family, emphasizing the end of a dynasty. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the king's mother held significant influence, often involved in political affairs, making her exile equally impactful.<p><b>into another land</b><br>This refers to the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The land is Babylon, where many Judeans were taken captive. This exile fulfilled earlier prophecies and warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who cautioned against disobedience to God. The geographical shift from Judah to Babylon symbolizes a loss of identity and divine favor.<p><b>where neither of you were born</b><br>This highlights the foreignness and unfamiliarity of the land of exile. It underscores the disconnection from their heritage and the Promised Land, which was central to Jewish identity and God's covenant with Israel. The phrase also implies a lack of belonging and the absence of ancestral ties, which would have been distressing in a culture that valued lineage and land inheritance.<p><b>and there you both will die</b><br>This finality indicates the irreversible nature of God's judgment on Jehoiachin and his mother. It signifies the end of their influence and the cessation of their royal line in Judah. The death in a foreign land without returning to their homeland fulfills the prophetic warnings of Jeremiah and others. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God, reinforcing the theme of divine justice throughout the scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.
