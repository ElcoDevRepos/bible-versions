The shattering indicates not just physical destruction but also the collapse of Moab's power and influence. Historically, Moab was a significant kingdom east of the Dead Sea, often at odds with Israel (2 Kings 3). The shattering can be seen as a fulfillment of divine judgment against Moab for its pride and idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>).<p><b>How they wail!</b><br>The wailing signifies deep mourning and lamentation, a common cultural expression of grief in the ancient Near East. This mourning is not just for the loss of life but also for the loss of national identity and pride. The wailing of Moab is reminiscent of the lamentations found in other prophetic books, such as Lamentations, where the people mourn the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>How Moab has turned his back in shame!</b><br>Turning one's back in shame indicates a complete reversal of fortune and a loss of honor. Moab, once a proud and powerful nation, is now humiliated. This shame is a result of their arrogance and opposition to God's people. The imagery of turning one's back is also used in other scriptures to denote defeat and disgrace (<a href="/psalms/44-10.htm">Psalm 44:10</a>).<p><b>Moab has become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around him.</b><br>This phrase highlights the complete downfall of Moab, making it a cautionary tale for surrounding nations. The ridicule and horror suggest that Moab's fate serves as a warning of the consequences of pride and rebellion against God. This mirrors the fate of other nations judged by God, such as Babylon (Isaiah 13) and Edom (Obadiah). The prophetic literature often uses such imagery to demonstrate God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to humble the proud.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

God&#8217;s word has come to pass exactly as spoken.<p>&#8226; The scene mirrors other judgments: &#8220;Ar in Moab is destroyed in a night&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>). When the Sovereign Lord decrees ruin, it is swift and undeniable.<p>&#8226; The shattering shows the certainty of divine justice. What seemed secure in human eyes has crumbled beneath God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How they wail!</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;How they wail!&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>b)<p>&#8226; The echoing lament rises from every corner of Moab. Wailing in Scripture signals irreversible loss (<a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; God Himself says, &#8220;Therefore I wail over Moab&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31</a>), underscoring both His righteous anger and His grief over sin&#8217;s consequences.<p>&#8226; Isaiah paints the same soundtrack: &#8220;In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops everyone wails&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Human pride boasted, but now voices falter. Judgment silences arrogance and produces the bitter music of repentance&#8212;or despair when repentance is refused.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How Moab has turned his back in shame!</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;How Moab has turned his back in shame!&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>c)<p>&#8226; Defeat forces Moab to flee, backs turned to the enemy&#8212;an ancient sign of disgrace (<a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Shame exposes false trust. &#8220;Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-13.htm">Jeremiah 48:13</a>). Idols could not rescue; only humiliation remains.<p>&#8226; The psalmist describes the scene: &#8220;Let those who seek my life be disgraced and confounded; may they be turned back in sudden shame&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Turning one&#8217;s back also hints at turning away from God. Instead of facing Him in surrender, Moab retreats into deeper embarrassment (<a href="/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moab has become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around him.</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Moab has become an object of ridicule and horror to all those around him.&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a>d)<p>&#8226; Neighbors watch and scoff. What Moab once dished out&#8212;mockery toward Israel&#8212;now comes full circle (<a href="/jeremiah/48-27.htm">Jeremiah 48:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel echoes the verdict: &#8220;Moab shall know that I am the LORD&#8221; when it becomes &#8220;a reproach among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Zephaniah intensifies the outcome: &#8220;Moab will be like Sodom&#8230; a perpetual desolation&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>). Horror blends with ridicule; people shake their heads in disbelief.<p>&#8226; The wider lesson: God publicly vindicates His holiness. Nations that exalt themselves will be laid low, providing a sober testimony to everyone who watches (<a href="/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-39.htm">Jeremiah 48:39</a> unfolds like four thunderclaps: shattering, wailing, shame, and ridicule. Each phrase reveals a different facet of God&#8217;s judgment on Moab&#8212;comprehensive ruin, heartfelt lament, public disgrace, and global scorn. Scripture consistently affirms that pride, idolatry, and opposition to God lead to this end. At the same time, the passage warns every generation that the Lord keeps His word exactly, exalting the humble and bringing down the arrogant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down!</span>--Better, taking the words in the Hebrew order, <span class= "ital">How is she broken down!
