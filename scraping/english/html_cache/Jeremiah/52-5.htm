This siege was conducted by the Babylonian army under King Nebuchadnezzar. The siege began in the ninth year of King Zedekiah's reign, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>. The siege was a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets, who had repeatedly called the people of Judah to repentance. The siege represents God's judgment on Judah for their persistent idolatry and disobedience. Archaeological evidence supports the historical reality of the Babylonian siege, with findings such as the Babylonian Chronicles providing external confirmation.<p><b>until King Zedekiah&#8217;s eleventh year</b><br>King Zedekiah was the last king of Judah, and his reign marked the end of the Davidic line of kings until the coming of Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant. Zedekiah's reign lasted from 597 to 586 BC, and his eleventh year corresponds to 586 BC, the year Jerusalem fell. This period of siege lasted approximately two and a half years, a time of great suffering and famine for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9-10</a>. The fall of Jerusalem was a pivotal moment in Jewish history, leading to the Babylonian exile, which had significant theological implications, including the development of Jewish identity and faith in exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

cf. <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s flow reminds us that God&#8217;s judgments unfold in a continuous, purposeful sequence (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226;
