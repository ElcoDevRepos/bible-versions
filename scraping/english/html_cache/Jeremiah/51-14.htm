Swearing by Himself underscores the certainty and unchangeable nature of His promise, as there is no higher authority by which He can swear (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>). This reflects God's sovereignty and His ultimate control over the events of history.<p><b>Surely I will fill you up with men as with locusts:</b><br>The imagery of locusts is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing overwhelming numbers and destruction (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, <a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>). Here, it suggests an invading army that will be as numerous and devastating as a swarm of locusts. Historically, this prophecy is directed against Babylon, predicting its downfall through the invasion of the Medes and Persians. The locust metaphor also connects to the plagues of Egypt, highlighting divine judgment.<p><b>and they will shout in triumph over you:</b><br>The shouting in triumph indicates victory and conquest. This phrase foretells the celebration of the conquerors over Babylon, a city known for its pride and idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47:1-5</a>). The historical fulfillment of this prophecy occurred when Cyrus the Great captured Babylon in 539 BC. The triumph over Babylon can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, as Babylon often symbolizes worldly opposition to God's kingdom (<a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.
