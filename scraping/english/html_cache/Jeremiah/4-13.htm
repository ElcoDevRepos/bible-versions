Clouds in the Bible frequently symbolize God's presence and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, where God leads the Israelites by a pillar of cloud. The advancing clouds here suggest an unstoppable approach, emphasizing the inevitability of the coming judgment. This imagery can also be linked to the prophetic visions of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, where the Son of Man comes with the clouds of heaven, indicating divine authority and intervention.<p><b>his chariots like the whirlwind</b><br>Chariots in ancient times were symbols of military might and speed. The comparison to a whirlwind suggests not only speed but also destructive power, as whirlwinds can cause chaos and devastation. This imagery is consistent with the descriptions of divine judgment found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>, where the Lord's way is in the whirlwind and the storm. The whirlwind also signifies the swift and comprehensive nature of the judgment that is to come, leaving no place untouched.<p><b>His horses are swifter than eagles</b><br>Horses were a key component of ancient warfare, representing strength and mobility. The comparison to eagles, known for their speed and keen sight, underscores the rapid and unavoidable nature of the approaching threat. In biblical symbolism, eagles often represent swiftness and the ability to execute God's will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, where those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength and soar on wings like eagles. This phrase highlights the futility of escape from the impending judgment.<p><b>Woe to us, for we are ruined!</b><br>"Woe" is a term frequently used by prophets to express lamentation and impending doom. It signifies a deep sense of despair and acknowledgment of inevitable destruction. The phrase "we are ruined" reflects the realization of the people of Judah that their sins have led to their downfall, as prophesied by Jeremiah. This echoes the themes of repentance and judgment found throughout the book of Jeremiah, where the prophet calls the people to return to God to avoid such ruin. The lamentation here is a call to recognize the seriousness of their situation and the need for divine intervention, reminiscent of the cries for deliverance found in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/79-8.htm">Psalm 79:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Judah&#8217;s only hope was earlier repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1-2</a>); ignoring that call has left them exposed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His chariots like the whirlwind</b><p>&#8226; A whirlwind comes with unstoppable force and disorienting speed. Likewise, Babylon&#8217;s chariots would tear through Judah&#8217;s defenses before the people could organize resistance (<a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a> describes the Lord coming &#8220;with fire, and His chariots like a whirlwind,&#8221; linking Babylon&#8217;s assault to divine retribution.<p>&#8226; The picture underlines how sin&#8217;s consequences gather momentum: what begins as spiritual drift ends in a storm of national calamity (<a href="/hosea/8-7.htm">Hosea 8:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His horses are swifter than eagles</b><p>&#8226; Babylon&#8217;s cavalry was famous for its reach; <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a> says, &#8220;Their horses are swifter than leopards&#8230; they fly like an eagle swooping to devour.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> foretold that if Israel rebelled, the LORD would raise up &#8220;a nation&#8230; like an eagle swooping down.&#8221; Jeremiah shows that prophecy coming to life.<p>&#8226; The eagle metaphor emphasizes precision hunting: Babylon will not merely surround Judah; it will capture, plunder, and deport (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Woe to us, for we are ruined!</b><p>&#8226; The people finally voice the terror Jeremiah has been warning about (<a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19-20</a>).

God&#8217;s call is always to timely repentance that produces real change (<a href="/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a> is a vivid, literal snapshot of the Babylonian invasion God unleashes because Judah refused to turn from sin. Clouds, whirlwind, and eagle-swift horses show judgment coming suddenly, violently, and inescapably. The people&#8217;s anguished &#8220;Woe to us!&#8221; confirms the certainty of God&#8217;s warnings. The verse therefore urges every reader to heed God&#8217;s calls to repentance while mercy is still offered, knowing His word is unfailingly accurate&#8212;both in promises of grace and in threats of judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He shall come up as clouds.</span>--He, the destroyer of nations, with armies that sweep like storm-clouds over the land they are going to destroy.
