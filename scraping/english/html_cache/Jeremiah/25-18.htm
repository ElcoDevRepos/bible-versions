The concept of ruin is a common theme in prophetic literature, symbolizing the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant. The destruction of these cities serves as a tangible manifestation of divine wrath, fulfilling the warnings given by earlier prophets.<p><b>an object of horror and contempt and cursing</b><br>The language here reflects the intense shame and disgrace that would befall the people of Judah. In the ancient Near Eastern context, becoming an object of horror and contempt meant that other nations would view them with disdain and fear. This fulfills the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to becoming a byword among the nations.<p><b>as they are to this day</b><br>This phrase suggests that the effects of the judgment were still evident at the time of writing. It underscores the enduring nature of God's judgment and serves as a historical reminder of the consequences of turning away from God. The phrase also implies that the prophecy had been fulfilled, lending credibility to Jeremiah's role as a prophet.<p><b>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah</b><br>Jerusalem, as the capital city, and the surrounding cities of Judah were central to the identity of the Israelite people. Their destruction would have been a devastating blow, both spiritually and politically. This judgment highlights the seriousness of their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness, as Jerusalem was the location of the temple, the center of worship.<p><b>its kings and officials</b><br>The inclusion of kings and officials indicates that the leadership of Judah was particularly culpable in leading the nation astray. Throughout the book of Jeremiah, the failure of the leaders to heed prophetic warnings is a recurring theme. This phrase emphasizes that judgment begins with those in positions of authority, reflecting the biblical principle that leaders bear greater responsibility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message of judgment to Judah and the surrounding nations.

History confirms the literal fall in 586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-10</a>). Jesus later laments, &#8220;Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>), showing the city&#8217;s ongoing pattern of resistance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its kings and officials</b><p>Leadership bears special accountability.

When shepherds go astray, sheep scatter (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>). The entire hierarchy&#8212;from palace to local magistrates&#8212;comes under the same cup of wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To make them a ruin</b><p>The phrase is blunt. God is not merely permitting calamity; He is actively &#8220;making&#8221; the land desolate. <a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a> foretells, &#8220;I will make this city a desolation.&#8221; The Babylonians torch walls, palaces, and temple (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>). Lamentations pictures the aftermath: &#8220;All who pass their way clap their hands; they hiss and shake their heads at Daughter Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>An object of horror</b><p>Judah&#8217;s fate becomes a cautionary tale that makes observers recoil. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a> warned Israel would become &#8220;an object of horror&#8221; if covenant curses fell.

Words spoken centuries earlier materialize verbatim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they are to this day</b><p>Jeremiah writes amid smoking ruins, not after hindsight reflection. The present-tense note underlines the prophecy&#8217;s literal fulfillment; judgment is visible proof that God keeps His Word (<a href="/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11-12</a>).

The ruined state of Jerusalem in Jeremiah&#8217;s own day validated every warning. The verse therefore stands as an enduring reminder that persistent rebellion invites certain judgment, that Scripture&#8217;s promises and threats alike come to pass, and that leadership and laity together bear responsibility before a holy God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">As it is this day.</span>--The words are not in the LXX., and may probably have been added after the prediction had received its fulfilment in the final capture of Jerusalem and the desolation of the country.
