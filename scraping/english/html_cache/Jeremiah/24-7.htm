The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. This transformation is a divine act, indicating that true knowledge of God is a gift rather than a human achievement. This echoes the promise of a new covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people. It also aligns with <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, where God promises to give a new heart and spirit. This transformation is necessary for a genuine relationship with God, highlighting the need for divine intervention in human hearts.<p><b>that I am the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the recognition of God's sovereignty and identity. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) is significant, as it is God's covenant name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>. Knowing God as the LORD involves understanding His character, faithfulness, and authority. This knowledge is not merely intellectual but relational, involving trust and obedience. The acknowledgment of God as LORD is central to the covenant relationship, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is called to recognize and worship God alone.<p><b>They will be My people</b><br>This phrase reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people. It is a recurring theme in Scripture, first established with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7-8</a> and reiterated throughout the Old Testament. Being God's people involves a special status and responsibility, including living according to His commandments and reflecting His character. This relationship is not based on ethnicity or nationality but on faith and obedience. In the New Testament, this concept is expanded to include all believers in Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>, where the church is described as a chosen people and a royal priesthood.<p><b>and I will be their God</b><br>This phrase signifies God's commitment to His people, promising His presence, protection, and provision. It is a central promise of the covenant, assuring the people of God's faithfulness and care. This relationship is reciprocal, requiring loyalty and worship from the people. The assurance of God's presence is a source of comfort and strength, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>. In the New Testament, this promise is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is Immanuel, "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>), and through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers.<p><b>for they will return to Me with all their heart</b><br>This phrase indicates repentance and wholehearted devotion. Returning to God involves turning away from sin and idolatry, as well as a sincere commitment to follow Him. The call to return is a common prophetic theme, urging Israel to repent and renew their covenant relationship with God. This return is not partial but involves the entire heart, signifying complete dedication and love for God. In the New Testament, this concept is echoed in the call to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a> and <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>. The transformation of the heart enables this genuine return to God, fulfilling His promise of restoration and renewal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment and calling them to repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles_of_judah.htm">The Exiles of Judah</a></b><br>The people of Judah who were taken into Babylonian captivity.
