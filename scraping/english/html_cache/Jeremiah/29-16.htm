At this time, Zedekiah was the king, a ruler placed by Nebuchadnezzar. The Davidic covenant promised a lasting dynasty, but the disobedience of the kings led to judgment and exile.<p><b>and all the people who remain in this city</b><br>The city is Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah.

The exiles were seen as having a future hope, as Jeremiah's letters encouraged them to settle and seek the city's welfare (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>).

God&#8217;s covenant with David promised a lasting throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>), yet individual kings could experience discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm">Jeremiah 22:1&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226;

Their confidence contrasted with the exiles&#8217; humiliation, yet God declares that remaining in the land apart from obedience only invites wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement levels the ground: neither palace nor city walls can exempt anyone from accountability (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your brothers who did not go with you into exile&#8212;</b><p>God addresses the captive audience in Babylon, calling the Jerusalem residents their &#8220;brothers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Familial language highlights shared identity, but also exposes misplaced envy: the exiles longed for home, while the stay-behinds seemed privileged (<a href="/psalms/137-1.htm">Psalm 137:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord flips that perception. Immediately after verse 16 He says, &#8220;I will send against them sword, famine, and plague&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Ezekiel, prophesying to the same exiles, echoes this reversal: &#8220;Those in the city shall be devoured&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/11-6.htm">Ezekiel 11:6&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The exile, though painful, is God&#8217;s refining tool leading to future hope (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10&#8211;14</a>); the so-called fortunate brothers will face harsher judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/29-16.htm">Jeremiah 29:16</a> assures the Babylonian exiles that God&#8217;s word, not visible circumstances, defines reality. The Davidic king still on the throne and the compatriots still in Jerusalem are not safer or more blessed; they stand under looming judgment because they reject God&#8217;s commands. Conversely, the exiles&#8212;chastened yet preserved&#8212;are positioned for restoration.
