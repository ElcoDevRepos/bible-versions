The context is significant as it highlights the power of God's word to convict and stir the hearts of its hearers. The scroll, dictated by Jeremiah and written by Baruch, contained messages of impending judgment due to Judah's disobedience. This moment underscores the importance of hearing and responding to God's word, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>they turned to one another in fear</b><br>The fear experienced by the officials indicates a recognition of the seriousness of the prophecies. This fear can be seen as a reverent acknowledgment of God's authority and the reality of His impending judgment. In the cultural context of ancient Judah, fear was a common response to divine messages, reflecting an understanding of the consequences of sin. This reaction parallels other biblical instances where individuals respond with fear to divine revelations, such as the shepherds at Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p><b>and said to Baruch</b><br>Baruch, the scribe, played a crucial role in delivering Jeremiah's message. His presence and involvement highlight the importance of faithful service in God's work. Baruch's willingness to stand by Jeremiah and deliver a difficult message is reminiscent of other biblical figures who served as messengers of God's word, such as Moses and Aaron. This phrase also emphasizes the role of intermediaries in communicating divine messages, a theme seen throughout the Bible.<p><b>&#8220;Surely we must report all these words to the king.&#8221;</b><br>The decision to report to the king reflects the officials' sense of duty and the gravity of the message. It shows an understanding that the king, as the leader of the nation, needed to be informed of God's warnings. This action is significant in the historical context, as it demonstrates the tension between prophetic messages and royal authority. The officials' response can be compared to other instances where God's messengers confronted kings, such as Nathan with David (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the eventual rejection of the message by King Jehoiakim, illustrating the theme of human resistance to divine warnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>The scribe and faithful companion of Jeremiah, who wrote down the words of the prophecy as dictated by Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_officials.htm">The Officials</a></b><br>A group of leaders in Judah who heard the words of the scroll and were struck with fear, recognizing the gravity of the message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Jehoiakim)</a></b><br>The reigning king of Judah at the time, who would later react to the reading of the scroll with hostility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>The written record of Jeremiah's prophecies, which Baruch read aloud to the officials, leading to their fearful response.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>The officials' fear upon hearing the scroll highlights the inherent power and authority of God's word to convict and provoke a response.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_to_respond.htm">Responsibility to Respond</a></b><br>The officials recognized the need to report the message to the king, illustrating our responsibility to act upon God's word and share it with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the Lord</a></b><br>Their fear underscores the importance of a reverent fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom and leads to repentance and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_service.htm">Faithful Service</a></b><br>Baruch's role as a scribe demonstrates the importance of faithfully serving God in whatever capacity He calls us, even in the face of potential danger.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human resistance, God's purposes will prevail, as seen in the eventual fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_36_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Jeremiah_36_16_on_listeners.htm">How does Jeremiah 36:16 demonstrate the power of God's word on listeners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Officials_reaction_in_Jeremiah_36_16.htm">What can we learn from the officials' reaction to the scroll in Jeremiah 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_36_16_Hebrews_4_12_link.htm">How does Jeremiah 36:16 connect with Hebrews 4:12 about the word's impact?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Response_to_God_s_truth_in_Jeremiah_36_16.htm">How should we respond when confronted with God's truth, as in Jeremiah 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_heed_God_s_warnings_today_2.htm">What steps can we take to ensure we heed God's warnings today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Jeremiah_36_16_s_impact.htm">What historical context surrounds Jeremiah 36:16 and its impact on the audience's reaction?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_36_16_God_s_word_instills_fear.htm">How does Jeremiah 36:16 demonstrate the power of God's word to instill fear?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_officials_fear_Jeremiah_36_16.htm">Why did the officials react with fear upon hearing the words in Jeremiah 36:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_36.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_jehoiakim_quickly_learn_of_jeremiah.htm">How likely is it that Jehoiakim and his officials quickly learned of Jeremiah's prophecies to act swiftly, given the slow communication of the time?
