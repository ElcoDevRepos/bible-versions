The city is under siege by the Babylonians, also known as the Chaldeans. The "sword" refers to the violence and warfare that will occur, "famine" indicates the severe food shortages due to the siege, and "plague" suggests disease outbreaks that often accompany such dire conditions. Historically, sieges were brutal, leading to starvation and disease as supplies ran out. This warning is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience to God leads to such calamities.<p><b>but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who besiege you will live</b><br>This part of the verse presents a counterintuitive command: surrender to the enemy to preserve life. In the ancient Near Eastern context, surrendering to a besieging army was often seen as a last resort, yet here it is presented as an act of obedience to God's will. The Chaldeans, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, are instruments of God's judgment against Judah for their persistent idolatry and disobedience. This call to surrender is a test of faith, requiring trust in God's plan despite the apparent danger.<p><b>he will retain his life like a spoil of war</b><br>The phrase "like a spoil of war" suggests that life itself is a prize to be won. In ancient warfare, spoils were the goods and captives taken by the victors. Here, God promises that those who obey His command to surrender will have their lives spared, as if they were valuable spoils. This reflects the biblical theme of God valuing obedience over sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>) and highlights His mercy even in judgment. The preservation of life through surrender can also be seen as a type of salvation, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who calls believers to surrender their lives to Him for eternal life (<a href="/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
