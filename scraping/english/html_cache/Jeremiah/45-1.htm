Baruch, his scribe, played a crucial role in recording these prophecies. Baruch's lineage, being the son of Neriah, suggests he came from a family of some standing, possibly with connections to the royal court. This relationship between prophet and scribe highlights the importance of preserving divine messages, a practice seen throughout biblical history, such as Moses and Joshua or Paul and Tertius.<p><b>when he wrote these words on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah</b><br>The act of writing on a scroll was a common method of documentation in ancient times, ensuring the permanence and dissemination of important messages. This process underscores the seriousness and divine authority of the message. The dictation indicates that the words were not Baruch's own but were faithfully transcribed from Jeremiah, emphasizing the prophetic nature of the message. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where God's words are recorded, such as the tablets of the Law given to Moses.<p><b>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah</b><br>The fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign corresponds to around 605 BC, a tumultuous period in Judah's history. Jehoiakim, unlike his father Josiah, was not a godly king and often resisted Jeremiah's messages. This timeframe is significant as it marks the beginning of Babylonian dominance in the region, with Nebuchadnezzar's first invasion of Judah occurring shortly after. The historical context of Jehoiakim's reign is crucial for understanding the urgency and gravity of Jeremiah's prophecies, as they often warned of impending judgment and called for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
