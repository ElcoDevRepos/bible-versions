In the prophetic books, such declarations underscore that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but directly from God. This is a common formula used by prophets to assert the divine origin of their message, seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8216;I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants.</b><br>Shemaiah the Nehelamite was a false prophet who opposed Jeremiah. The punishment of false prophets is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>. The mention of his descendants indicates that the consequences of his actions would affect his lineage, reflecting the biblical principle of generational impact of sin (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><b>He will have no one left among this people,</b><br>This phrase indicates total eradication from the community, a severe judgment reflecting the seriousness of his offense. In ancient Israel, being cut off from the people was a significant punishment, as community and lineage were central to identity and inheritance.<p><b>nor will he see the good that I will bring to My people,</b><br>The "good" refers to the future restoration and blessings God promised to Israel, such as the return from exile and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. This exclusion from witnessing God's blessings highlights the severity of Shemaiah's rebellion. It contrasts with the hope and future promised to the faithful remnant in <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This reiteration of divine authority serves to emphasize the certainty and seriousness of the pronouncement.

In the context of Jeremiah, false prophets like Shemaiah were telling the people what they wanted to hear, rather than the truth of God's impending judgment and call to repentance. This rebellion is akin to the sin of witchcraft, as noted in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, and is a direct challenge to God's authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah_the_nehelamite.htm">Shemaiah the Nehelamite</a></b><br>A false prophet who opposed Jeremiah and misled the people by preaching rebellion against the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through His prophets and enacts judgment and blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, who were in exile in Babylon at the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The period during which the people of Judah were taken captive to Babylon, a central theme in Jeremiah's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_false_prophecy.htm">The Danger of False Prophecy</a></b><br>False prophets, like Shemaiah, lead people away from God's truth.
