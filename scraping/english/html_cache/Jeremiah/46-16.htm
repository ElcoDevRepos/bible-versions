Historically, this refers to the Egyptian forces under Pharaoh Necho II, who were defeated by the Babylonians. The imagery of stumbling suggests a lack of stability and control, often used in Scripture to describe those who are spiritually or morally faltering (<a href="/isaiah/8-15.htm">Isaiah 8:15</a>).<p><b>indeed, they have fallen over one another.</b><br>The chaos and disorder among the troops are emphasized here. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment against Egypt, as prophesied by Jeremiah. The phrase evokes the idea of panic and disarray, similar to the confusion seen in other biblical battles where God intervenes (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p><b>They say, &#8216;Get up!</b><br>This call to action indicates a moment of realization and urgency among the soldiers. It reflects a desperate attempt to regroup and escape the dire situation. The imperative "Get up!" is often used in Scripture to signify a turning point or a call to repentance (<a href="/jonah/1-6.htm">Jonah 1:6</a>).<p><b>Let us return to our people and to the land of our birth,</b><br>The soldiers' desire to return home highlights their defeat and loss of morale. It underscores the futility of their campaign and the longing for safety and familiarity. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of exile and return, seen in the experiences of Israel and Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>).<p><b>away from the sword of the oppressor.&#8217;</b><br>The "sword of the oppressor" symbolizes the Babylonian forces, representing God's instrument of judgment. This phrase underscores the theme of divine retribution against nations that oppose God's will. The imagery of the sword is frequently used in Scripture to denote judgment and warfare (<a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this chapter, which is facing impending judgment and defeat by the Babylonians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians</a></b><br>The oppressors and conquerors, used by God as instruments of judgment against Egypt and other nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword_of_the_oppressor.htm">The Sword of the Oppressor</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Babylonian military force and God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_birth.htm">The Land of Birth</a></b><br>Refers to the homeland of the soldiers or people who are fleeing back to their origins to escape the impending doom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Inevitability of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is certain and cannot be escaped by human means.

God is actively toppling what human strength exalts, just as He promised earlier in Jeremiah that He would &#8220;shatter the pride of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This stumbling is not a momentary lapse; it is a divine judgment in motion.<p>&#8226; When human confidence replaces trust in the Lord, collapse becomes inevitable (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Indeed, they have fallen over one another</b><p>The scene intensifies: panic turns the ranks into a tangled heap. Friendly bodies become obstacles, underscoring utter defeat (<a href="/leviticus/26-37.htm">Leviticus 26:37</a>). In Scripture, confusion in battle often signals the Lord&#8217;s direct intervention&#8212;think of Midian&#8217;s camp in Gideon&#8217;s day (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>) or the Ammonites under Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is not abstract; it lands visibly, leaving no doubt who rules the field (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Mutual collapse exposes the futility of alliances built on anything other than obedience to the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They say, &#8220;Get up!&#8221;</b><p>Broken warriors bark orders at themselves. The imperative reveals how sudden their strength has evaporated. There is no strategic regrouping, only frantic self-motivation (<a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Desperation can sound like courage, yet without the Lord it is empty bravado (<a href="/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; God lets Egypt feel the shock of self-reliance failing so Israel will grasp that only covenant faithfulness secures protection (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us return to our people</b><p>The soldiers decide home looks safer than the front lines.

For God&#8217;s people, the scene is both warning and comfort: worldly strength will fail, but the covenant&#8208;keeping God remains the unfailing refuge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Arise, and let us go again to our own people.</span>--The case contemplated is that of the settlers in Egypt, the Lydians, Ionians, and Carians (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/46-9.htm" title="Come up, you horses; and rage, you chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.">Jeremiah 46:9</a>) whom Psammetichus had encouraged, or the fugitives from Judaea of <a href="/context/jeremiah/43-5.htm" title="But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;">Jeremiah 43:5-7</a>. These should find that it was no longer a safe home for them. The "oppressing sword" is beyond question the right rendering, but it is curious that both the LXX. and Vulgate have taken the adjective in different senses: the former giving "from the Greek sword," as if the word for oppressing (<span class= "ital">Ionah</span>) meant Ionian; and the latter, the apparently strange version, <span class= "ital">a facie gladii columb? </span>("from before the sword of the dove"). See, however, as giving a possible explanation of the words as referring to the dove as a symbol of the Chaldaean power, the Note on <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm" title="He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 25:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To fall;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to stumble</span>. The fugitives are in such a wild confusion that they stumble over each other. The parallel passage in the earlier prophecy (ver. 12) suggests that the Egyptian warriors are here referred to, the most trustworthy portion of which, since the time of Psammetichus, was composed of mercenaries, the native troops having lost that military ardour for which they had been anciently renowned (see Herod., 2:152, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note <span class="accented">ap.</span> Rawlinson).
