Thunder is often associated with God's voice in Scripture, symbolizing His authority and majesty (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-4</a>). The "waters in the heavens" may refer to the ancient understanding of the firmament, where waters were believed to be stored above the sky (<a href="/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>). This imagery underscores God's control over the elements, a theme prevalent in the Psalms and prophetic literature.<p><b>He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth.</b><br>This highlights God's omnipresence and His ability to orchestrate the natural world. The "ends of the earth" suggests the vastness of God's creation and His reach over all the earth. Clouds are often seen as instruments of God's will, bringing both blessing and judgment (<a href="/job/37-11.htm">Job 37:11-13</a>). This phrase connects to the idea of God as the sustainer of life, providing rain for crops and sustaining the earth's ecosystems.<p><b>He generates the lightning with the rain</b><br>This phrase illustrates the interconnectedness of natural events under God's command. Lightning and rain are often seen together in storms, symbolizing both God's power and provision. Lightning can represent God's judgment (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23</a>) while rain is a sign of His blessing and sustenance (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). This duality reflects the complexity of God's interaction with the world, where He is both just and merciful.<p><b>and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.</b><br>The wind is another element under God's control, often used in Scripture to signify His Spirit or His actions in the world (<a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). The idea of "storehouses" suggests a divine reserve from which God dispenses His resources, emphasizing His role as the provider. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe God as having treasuries of snow, hail, and wind (<a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22-24</a>). The wind can also symbolize change or the movement of God's plans, as seen in the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel. He is the author of the Book of Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>In this context, it refers to the sky or the firmament, where natural phenomena like thunder, clouds, and lightning occur, demonstrating God's power over creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ends_of_the_earth.htm">Ends of the Earth</a></b><br>This phrase signifies the entirety of the earth, emphasizing God's sovereignty and control over all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/storehouses.htm">Storehouses</a></b><br>A metaphorical term used to describe God's control over natural elements, such as wind, which He can release at His command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, demonstrating His omnipotence and authority over nature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>This verse reminds us of God's ultimate control over the natural world.

Thunder is not a random natural rumble; it is the audible sign that the Creator is speaking and acting (<a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/job/37-2.htm">Job 37:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>- &#8220;The waters in the heavens&#8221; point to the upper chambers described in <a href="/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>, a literal reservoir God established above. When these waters &#8220;roar,&#8221; heaven itself acknowledges His authority.<p>- The verse reminds Judah that idols are silent (<a href="/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>), but the living God is unmistakably heard. His thunder both declares judgment and offers reassurance to those who fear Him (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-2.htm">Revelation 14:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth</b><p>- Clouds do not drift aimlessly; God &#8220;causes&#8221; them to rise. The verb underlines intentional, continuous action (<a href="/psalms/104-13.htm">Psalm 104:13</a>).<p>- &#8220;From the ends of the earth&#8221; widens the stage: the Maker commands the atmosphere from horizon to horizon (<a href="/job/26-7.htm">Job 26:7&#8211;10</a>).<p>- By directing the water cycle, He meets human need&#8212;echoing Elijah&#8217;s solitary cloud that signaled rain after drought (<a href="/1_kings/18-44.htm">1 Kings 18:44</a>). Jeremiah confronts the people&#8217;s temptation to trust local fertility gods by pointing to the One who rules every cloud everywhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He generates the lightning with the rain</b><p>- Lightning and rain arrive together because God coordinates them (<a href="/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>).<p>- Ancient pagans split these forces among different deities, but Jeremiah insists they issue from one sovereign hand (<a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>).<p>- In literal meteorology, lightning helps release nitrogen that fertilizes soil&#8212;a hidden mercy wrapped in power (<a href="/job/38-25.htm">Job 38:25&#8211;27</a>). Spiritually, the flash warns of judgment even as the rain nourishes; both displays come from the same gracious Lord (<a href="/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24, 26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He brings forth the wind from His storehouses</b><p>- &#8220;Storehouses&#8221; picture vast divine treasuries (<a href="/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>). Wind, invisible yet forceful, is not self-originating but released at God&#8217;s command.<p>- Whether a gentle breeze that cools a field (<a href="/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>) or the storm that redirected Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>), every gust fulfills a purpose.<p>- Jesus later calms the wind with a word (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>), confirming that the One who spoke through Jeremiah still holds the keys to these heavenly storehouses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/10-13.htm">Jeremiah 10:13</a> pulls back the curtain on everyday weather to show the personal, active rule of God. Thunder, waters above, clouds, lightning, rain, and wind are not random; they originate in His deliberate, benevolent governance. The verse confronts idolatry by revealing a Creator whose power spans heaven and earth yet whose providence sustains life. Recognizing His hand in the skies invites humble trust and wholehearted worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">A multitude of waters.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">a rush of waters, </span>following on the thunder, which is thought of as the voice of God (comp. <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm" title="The voice of the LORD is on the waters: the God of glory thunders: the LORD is on many waters.">Psalm 29:3</a>).

We have no data, however, for saying which is the older of the two. The idea of the "treasure chambers" from which the winds are brought appears in <a href="/job/38-22.htm" title="Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,">Job 38:22</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he uttereth his voice</span>, etc. The phrase is difficult, but the Authorized Version probably gives the right sense.
