Historically, Israel often vacillated between following God and pursuing alliances with foreign nations. This impulsiveness reflects a lack of faith and trust in God's provision and protection. The Israelites' tendency to change their ways can be seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the book of Judges, where they repeatedly turned away from God to follow other gods, only to return to Him in times of distress. This behavior is a warning against spiritual instability and the dangers of not being steadfast in one's faith.<p><b>You will be disappointed by Egypt just as you were by Assyria.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the futility of relying on foreign powers for security and deliverance. Historically, Egypt and Assyria were major powers in the ancient Near East, and Israel often sought alliances with them to protect against other threats. However, these alliances frequently led to disappointment and disaster. For example, in <a href="/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>, the alliance with Assyria ultimately resulted in the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Similarly, reliance on Egypt proved futile, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>, when Egypt was unable to protect Judah from Babylonian conquest. This serves as a reminder of the importance of relying on God rather than human powers, echoing the biblical theme that true security comes from God alone.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often rebuked by God through the prophets for their idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A powerful nation to the south of Israel, often seen as a potential ally or refuge by the Israelites, but ultimately unreliable.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A dominant empire in the ancient Near East, previously a threat to Israel and Judah, and a symbol of misplaced trust when Judah sought alliances.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who calls His people to faithfulness and warns them against relying on foreign powers instead of Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_unstable_faith.htm">The Danger of Unstable Faith</a></b><br>Just as Judah was criticized for constantly changing its ways, believers today must be wary of wavering in their faith and convictions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_trust.htm">Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>The Israelites' reliance on Egypt and Assyria serves as a cautionary tale about placing our trust in worldly powers or solutions instead of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_vs._human_unreliability.htm">God's Faithfulness vs. Human Unreliability</a></b><br>While human alliances may fail, God's promises remain steadfast.

Like someone darting from one idea to the next, the nation keeps jumping from one source of security to another instead of resting in the Lord who brought them out of Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). Elijah once asked, &#8220;How long will you waver between two opinions?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). Hosea lamented, &#8220;Your loyalty is like the morning mist&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>). The pattern of spiritual fickleness is a heart issue, not merely political miscalculation. James calls such a person &#8220;double-minded, unstable in all his ways&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>). Judah&#8217;s instability shows a lack of covenant love (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>), exposing a heart that would rather chase quick fixes than trust God&#8217;s unchanging character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>constantly changing your ways!</b><p>The phrase pictures a traveler who keeps switching roads and never reaches home. Earlier in the chapter the Lord asked, &#8220;What fault did your fathers find in Me that they strayed so far from Me?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>). They traded &#8220;the fountain of living water&#8221; for &#8220;broken cisterns&#8221; (2:13). Even occasional bursts of repentance were shallow (<a href="/jeremiah/3-10.htm">Jeremiah 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Their worship ping-ponged between Yahweh and Baal (<a href="/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Their politics ricocheted between superpowers.<p>&#8226; Their morals adjusted to whichever god or ally they favored that week.<p>Such constant course-changing contradicts God&#8217;s call: &#8220;Stand at the crossroads and look&#8230; walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will be disappointed by Egypt</b><p>Judah&#8217;s latest scheme was an alliance with Pharaoh Neco to counter Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-10</a>). The Lord had already warned, &#8220;Those who go down to Egypt for help&#8230; do not look to the Holy One of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). Depending on Egypt was like leaning on &#8220;a broken reed that pierces the hand&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>; cf. <a href="/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt looked impressive&#8212;chariots, horses, money&#8212;but could not change God&#8217;s decree of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt symbolized the very place God had once delivered them from; returning there was a reversal of redemption (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>).<p>The promised &#8220;disappointment&#8221; is not a mere setback; it is the inevitable collapse of any refuge that is not the Lord (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as you were by Assyria.</b><p>Judah only had to remember recent history. Kings like Ahaz hired Assyria to fight their battles (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>), but Assyria &#8220;gave him trouble instead of help&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-20.htm">2 Chronicles 28:20-21</a>). The northern kingdom of Israel courted Assyria and was ultimately carried into exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). Hosea warned, &#8220;When Ephraim saw his sickness&#8230; he sent to the great king, but he cannot cure you&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>). Trust in Assyria brought bondage; trust in Egypt would bring the same. God is teaching that every human alliance made in unbelief eventually betrays the one who seeks it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a> is God&#8217;s loving rebuke: Judah&#8217;s chronic impulsiveness and constant course-changing reveal a heart that refuses to rest in Him. Political deals with Egypt will collapse, just as reliance on Assyria did. The verse calls believers to single-hearted trust. Every substitute&#8212;whether ancient superpower or modern solution&#8212;ends in disappointment, but those who &#8220;trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/125-1.htm">Psalm 125:1</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">Why gaddest thou . . .?</span>--The vigorous English expresses well, perhaps even with some added force, the frequentative force of the Hebrew. What meant this perpetual change of policy, this shifting of alliances? Shame and confusion should follow from the alliance with Nechoh, as it had followed from that with Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-20.htm" title="And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.">2Chronicles 28:20</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why gaddest thou about so much</span> - many render, <span class="accented">Why runnest thou so quickly</span>; but the verb simply means to go, and it is enough to refer to foreign embassies, such as are alluded to in this very chapter (ver. 18) - <span class="cmt_word">to change thy way</span>?

This is certainly difficult, for in the reign of Josiah it would appear that the political connection with Assyria still continued, Is it possible that Jeremiah, in these words, has in view rather the circumstances of Jehoiakim than those of Josiah? Does he not appear to look back upon Judah's final "putting to shame through Assyria" as a thing of the past? And to what event can this expression refer but to the overthrow of Josiah at Megiddo (so Graf)? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">unstable you are,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1494;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#234;&#183;z&#601;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go away, to disappear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">constantly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3966.htm">Strong's 3966: </a> </span><span class="str2">Vehemence, vehemently, wholly, speedily</span><br /><br /><span class="word">changing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;an&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
