In the context of Jeremiah, God is speaking about the exiles in Babylon, promising His watchful care over them. This reflects God's covenant faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>, where the land of Israel is described as a place under God's constant watch. The phrase also echoes the assurance found in <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>, where God is depicted as a vigilant guardian who neither slumbers nor sleeps.<p><b>and will return them to this land</b><br>Here, God promises the restoration of the exiles to their homeland, a theme prevalent in the prophetic books. This return is not just physical but also spiritual, as it signifies a renewal of the covenant relationship. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when the Persian King Cyrus allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem (<a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). Theologically, it prefigures the ultimate gathering of God's people, as seen in eschatological passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>.<p><b>I will build them up and not tear them down</b><br>This phrase contrasts with the earlier judgments pronounced on Judah, where God declared He would tear down what He had built (<a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The promise to build up signifies restoration and growth, both physically in terms of the nation and spiritually in terms of the people's relationship with God. It reflects the hope of renewal and echoes the promise of a new covenant found in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<p><b>I will plant them and not uproot them</b><br>The imagery of planting suggests stability and permanence, contrasting with the uprooting that symbolizes judgment and exile (<a href="/jeremiah/12-14.htm">Jeremiah 12:14-17</a>). This agricultural metaphor is common in Scripture, illustrating God's intention to establish His people firmly in their land. It also points to the Messianic hope, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>, where the righteous are described as the branch of God's planting, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
