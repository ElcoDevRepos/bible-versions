This phrase indicates a direct communication from the prophet to the people, emphasizing the importance of the message. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's words, often calling for repentance and warning of consequences for disobedience. This setting is post-exilic, where the remnant of Judah had fled to Egypt against God's command (<a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>).<p><b>both men and women</b><br>The inclusion of both men and women highlights the communal responsibility and involvement in the actions being addressed. In ancient Israelite society, men typically held leadership roles, but women also played significant parts in religious practices, as seen in the worship of the "queen of heaven" (<a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19</a>). This indicates that the idolatrous practices were widespread and not limited to one gender.<p><b>who were answering him</b><br>This phrase suggests a dialogue or response from the people to Jeremiah's previous messages. The people's response often reflected their resistance or justification of their actions, particularly in their continued idolatry. This interaction is part of a larger narrative where the people defend their worship of other gods, believing it brought them prosperity (<a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-18</a>). This reflects a recurring theme in Jeremiah's ministry: the struggle between true worship of Yahweh and the people's inclination towards idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies of judgment and calls for repentance.
