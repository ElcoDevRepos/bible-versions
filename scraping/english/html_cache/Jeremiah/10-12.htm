The power of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting His ability to create and sustain the universe. In <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, the creation account demonstrates God's power as He speaks the world into existence. This power is not only creative but also sustaining, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, where it is stated that in Christ, all things hold together. The power of God in creation is a testament to His sovereignty over all things, contrasting with the impotence of idols mentioned earlier in <a href="/jeremiah/10.htm">Jeremiah 10</a>.<p><b>He established the world by His wisdom</b><br>God's wisdom in creation is a theme that resonates with the wisdom literature of the Bible, particularly in <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>, which states, "By wisdom the LORD laid the earth&#8217;s foundations." This wisdom is not merely intellectual but is deeply practical, reflecting God's perfect plan and purpose for creation. The order and complexity of the natural world testify to this divine wisdom. The Hebrew concept of wisdom (chokmah) often involves skill and craftsmanship, suggesting that God's creation is both intentional and masterfully executed.<p><b>and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</b><br>The imagery of stretching out the heavens is a common biblical metaphor for God's creative work, found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> and <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>. This phrase underscores God's understanding, which in Hebrew thought involves insight and discernment. The heavens, often representing the vastness and majesty of the universe, reflect God's infinite understanding and knowledge. This understanding is not only about the physical universe but also encompasses God's plan for redemption, as seen in the unfolding of biblical prophecy and the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.

The same God who spoke to Abraham, rescued Israel from Egypt, and revealed Himself at Sinai is the One who fashioned solid ground beneath our feet.
