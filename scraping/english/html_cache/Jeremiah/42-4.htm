This phrase indicates his attentiveness and willingness to engage with the people's request. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to be a mediator between God and the people, often delivering messages that were difficult to hear. His response here shows his commitment to his prophetic duty despite the challenges he faced, including persecution and imprisonment.<p><b>"I will surely pray to the LORD your God as you request,"</b><br>Jeremiah's promise to pray underscores the importance of intercessory prayer in the life of a prophet. The phrase "the LORD your God" highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding the people of their identity and obligations. Jeremiah's assurance to pray reflects his faithfulness and dedication to seeking God's will, even when the people themselves were often unfaithful.<p><b>"and I will tell you everything that the LORD answers."</b><br>This commitment to relay God's message in its entirety is crucial. Prophets were expected to convey God's words without alteration, emphasizing the integrity and reliability of true prophecy. Jeremiah's promise to communicate "everything" underscores the transparency and accountability required of a prophet. This mirrors the biblical principle that God's word is complete and sufficient, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a>.<p><b>"I will not withhold a word from you."</b><br>Jeremiah's assurance that he will not withhold any part of God's message highlights the prophet's role as a faithful messenger. This phrase reflects the seriousness with which prophets approached their task, as withholding God's word would be a grave sin. It also points to the nature of divine revelation, which is meant to be fully disclosed for the guidance and correction of God's people. This echoes the New Testament teaching in <a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>, where Paul declares he did not shrink from declaring the whole counsel of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Israelites.

Genuine listening is the first act of a faithful shepherd (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; His words echo the posture of the LORD, who &#8220;heard their groaning&#8221; in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>). This moment reassures the people that their plea has reached both prophet and God.<p>&#8226; By saying he has heard, Jeremiah signals that he is not dismissive or distracted, but attentive&#8212;unlike the false prophets who &#8220;do not listen to My words&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-22.htm">Jeremiah 23:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied Jeremiah the prophet</b><p>&#8226; Scripture highlights Jeremiah&#8217;s prophetic office to remind us that he speaks with God-given authority (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; His reply stands in contrast to leaders who relied on human schemes rather than divine counsel (<a href="/jeremiah/40-13.htm">Jeremiah 40:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The text shows a prophet acting as mediator, much like Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-20</a>), reinforcing that true guidance comes through God-appointed messengers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will surely pray to the LORD your God as you request</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah promises intercession. This mirrors Samuel&#8217;s pledge: &#8220;Far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Him &#8220;the LORD your God&#8221; reminds the people of covenant relationship, even after judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s willingness to pray despite past rejection (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4-6</a>) underscores the perseverance of godly leadership.<p>&#8226; Intercession is a pattern for believers who are urged to &#8220;pray for all people&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will tell you everything that the LORD answers</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah commits to relay the full message, whether comforting or challenging&#8212;like Micaiah who spoke only what the LORD said (<a href="/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Everything&#8221; rules out selective editing. God&#8217;s Word is whole and sufficient (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This vow guards against the temptation to soften hard truths (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores that revelation belongs to God; the prophet is merely a faithful courier (<a href="/john/3-27.htm">John 3:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not withhold a word from you</b><p>&#8226; Total transparency was already commanded: &#8220;Do not omit a word&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Withholding divine truth brings accountability (<a href="/ezekiel/33-7.htm">Ezekiel 33:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later adopted the same standard: &#8220;I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, this models courage to share Scripture without compromise, trusting that &#8220;the word of God is living and active&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/42-4.htm">Jeremiah 42:4</a> pictures a faithful prophet who listens, intercedes, receives God&#8217;s answer, and delivers it without alteration.
