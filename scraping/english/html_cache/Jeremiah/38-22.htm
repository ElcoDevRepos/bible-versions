The women in the palace represent the royal household and the vulnerability of the kingdom. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the fate of women often symbolized the fate of the nation. The palace, a place of security and power, is now a place of impending doom, reflecting the collapse of Judah's political and social structures.<p><b>will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon</b><br>This indicates the complete defeat and humiliation of Judah. Being brought out to the officials signifies surrender and subjugation. Historically, Babylonian officials would take captives to demonstrate their dominance. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of exile as a consequence of disobedience to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36</a>.<p><b>and those women will say: &#8216;They misled you and overcame you&#8212;those trusted friends of yours.</b><br>The women&#8217;s words reflect betrayal and misplaced trust. The "trusted friends" likely refer to the king's advisors who gave poor counsel, leading to the nation's downfall. This echoes the theme of false prophets and misguided leadership found throughout Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>). It serves as a warning against relying on human wisdom over divine guidance.<p><b>Your feet sank into the mire,</b><br>This imagery of sinking into mire symbolizes being trapped and helpless. It recalls Jeremiah's own experience in the cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>), serving as a metaphor for the king's entrapment due to poor decisions. The mire represents the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, a recurring theme in prophetic literature.<p><b>and they deserted you.&#8217;</b><br>Desertion by allies and advisors underscores the isolation and abandonment faced by those who reject God's counsel. This reflects the broader biblical principle that reliance on human strength leads to failure (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>). The desertion also prefigures the ultimate abandonment experienced by Jesus Christ on the cross, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant who is forsaken (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse illustrates that rejecting God&#8217;s word traps a person in a mire of helplessness, deserted by those once deemed dependable. Cross-references throughout Jeremiah and Kings confirm the literal fulfillment of this prophecy, reminding believers that genuine security rests only in wholehearted obedience to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the women that are left;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably the wives of Zedekiah's royal predecessors, who had passed into his own harem as concubines.
