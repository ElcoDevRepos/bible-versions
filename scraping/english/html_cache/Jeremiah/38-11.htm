His role as a foreigner and a eunuch highlights God's use of unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes. This act of bravery contrasts with the inaction of Judah's leaders. The involvement of "the men" suggests that Ebed-melech had some authority or influence, allowing him to gather assistance.<p><b>and went to the king&#8217;s palace</b><br>The king's palace was the center of political power in Jerusalem. Ebed-melech's access to the palace indicates his position within the royal court, likely as a trusted servant. This setting underscores the political tension and intrigue surrounding Jeremiah's imprisonment, as the prophet's messages were unpopular with the ruling class.<p><b>to a place below the storehouse</b><br>The storehouse was likely part of the palace complex, used for storing provisions. The mention of a location "below" suggests a lower, perhaps less visible area, which may have provided some privacy for Ebed-melech's actions. This detail highlights the resourcefulness required to carry out the rescue without drawing unwanted attention.<p><b>From there he took old rags and worn-out clothes</b><br>The use of old rags and worn-out clothes reflects the dire circumstances and limited resources available. These items, though humble, were chosen to cushion the ropes, showing Ebed-melech's thoughtfulness and care for Jeremiah's well-being. This act of kindness is reminiscent of God's provision through seemingly insignificant means.<p><b>and lowered them with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern</b><br>Jeremiah's imprisonment in a cistern symbolizes his rejection by the people he was sent to warn. Cisterns were often used for water storage, and being trapped in one would have been both physically and psychologically distressing. The lowering of the rags and clothes with ropes signifies a lifeline, a tangible expression of hope and deliverance. This rescue foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Christ, who lifts humanity from the pit of sin and despair.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Nothing could show the acuteness of the prophet's sufferings more vividly than the precautions which the thoughtful kindness of the Eunuch thus suggested. The pit was so deep that ropes were needed to draw him up, as they had been to let him down, and lest they should cut into the flesh of Jeremiah's emaciated form, improvised cushions had to be fastened to the ropes, that he might rest his arm-pits on them. He was, however, at last rescued, and re-instated in his former position, as a prisoner under the king's protection.<p>"Clout" in old English was used for a patch of cloth as distinct from the "rags," which were of linen.
