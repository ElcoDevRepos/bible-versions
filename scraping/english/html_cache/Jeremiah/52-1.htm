His young age at ascension reflects the turbulent times and the political instability of Judah. Appointed by Nebuchadnezzar II, Zedekiah's reign was marked by his struggle to maintain autonomy under Babylonian dominance. His age suggests a lack of experience, which may have contributed to his eventual downfall.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><br>Zedekiah's reign from 597 to 586 BC was a period of significant upheaval. Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, was a focal point of political and religious life. The eleven-year reign ended with the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, fulfilling the prophecies of Jeremiah and others about the consequences of Judah's disobedience to God. This period is crucial in understanding the transition from the Davidic monarchy to the Babylonian exile.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah</b><br>Hamutal, the mother of Zedekiah, was also the mother of Jehoahaz, another king of Judah. Her lineage connects Zedekiah to the royal family, emphasizing the dynastic nature of Judah's monarchy. The mention of her father, Jeremiah, not to be confused with the prophet, highlights the importance of family heritage and alliances in the political landscape of ancient Judah.<p><b>she was from Libnah</b><br>Libnah was a town in the Shephelah region of Judah, known for its strategic location. The mention of Hamutal's origin from Libnah may indicate the town's significance or her family's influence.

Scripture repeatedly notes the age of kings (<a href="/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-11.htm">2 Chronicles 36:11</a>) to help us grasp the maturity&#8212;or lack of it&#8212;behind their early decisions.<p>&#8226; Being appointed by Nebuchadnezzar after the deportation of Jehoiachin (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>) meant Zedekiah stepped into a throne already under foreign control. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s Word records these details to show how Judah&#8217;s leadership had shifted into dependence on Babylon, fulfilling warnings like <a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>.<p>&#8226; His youth combined with the political pressure of Babylon set the stage for the spiritual compromises that followed (<a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years</b><p>&#8226; Eleven years (597-586 BC) sounds substantial, yet compared with the forty-year reign of his father Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>) it was brief&#8212;a marker of instability and divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Those years ended in Jerusalem&#8217;s destruction (<a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12-14</a>), affirming the prophetic timeline God had declared through <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>: &#8220;This whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The location &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; stresses that the covenant city itself was no shield when its king rejected the Lord&#8217;s word (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah</b><p>&#8226; Scripture often names a king&#8217;s mother to trace covenant faithfulness or lack thereof (<a href="/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-2.htm">2 Kings 14:2</a>). With Hamutal, the same mother of Jehoahaz (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>), we see a family line linked to two sons who both faltered spiritually, contrasting sharply with their godly grandfather Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of &#8220;Jeremiah&#8221; here is not the prophet but Hamutal&#8217;s father, underscoring that identical names can appear in different family trees while the biblical record remains precise (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>).<p>&#8226; A king&#8217;s maternal influence was significant; yet even if Hamutal followed Josiah&#8217;s piety, her sons still chose rebellion, echoing <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a> on personal responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she was from Libnah</b><p>&#8226; Libnah, a Levitical town in Judah (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>), reminds us that Zedekiah&#8217;s heritage included priestly associations. Levitical roots should have directed him toward covenant obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8-10</a>), but he chose otherwise.<p>&#8226; Libnah&#8217;s earlier revolt against Judah in Joram&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>) pictures a city familiar with resisting ungodly rule&#8212;yet another historical echo that obedience to God, not political maneuvering, secures blessing.<p>&#8226; By locating Hamutal in Libnah, <a href="/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Jeremiah 52:1</a> anchors the narrative in literal geography, reinforcing the historical reliability of the account.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Jeremiah 52:1</a> compresses four factual statements: Zedekiah&#8217;s youth, his eleven-year reign under Babylonian shadow, his maternal lineage, and that lineage&#8217;s roots in Libnah. Each detail highlights God&#8217;s sovereign oversight of Judah&#8217;s history: youthful inexperience met foreign dominance, a short reign culminated in prophesied judgment, familial heritage revealed the tug-of-war between covenant privilege and personal rebellion, and the geographic note affirmed the concrete reality of these events. Taken together, the verse sets the stage for the chapter&#8217;s sober record of Jerusalem&#8217;s fall, underscoring that God&#8217;s word is both historically precise and spiritually instructive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/52-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Zedekiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6667.htm">Strong's 6667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zedekiah -- 'Yah is righteousness', six Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was twenty-one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#347;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6242.htm">Strong's 6242: </a> </span><span class="str2">Twenty, twentieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he became king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
