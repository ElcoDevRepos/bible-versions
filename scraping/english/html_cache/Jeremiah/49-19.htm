The Jordan River's thickets were known for their dense growth, providing cover for predators. The lion symbolizes strength and authority, often used in Scripture to represent kings or conquering nations (e.g., <a href="/hosea/5-14.htm">Hosea 5:14</a>). The "watered pasture" suggests a place of abundance and prosperity, indicating that the coming force will invade and take over fertile lands. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of God's judgment executed through powerful nations or leaders.<p><b>For in an instant I will chase Edom from her land.</b><br>Edom, the descendants of Esau, often found themselves in conflict with Israel. Historically, Edom was located south of the Dead Sea, a region known for its rugged terrain. This phrase indicates a swift and decisive judgment from God against Edom, emphasizing the immediacy and inevitability of divine retribution. The historical enmity between Edom and Israel is well-documented in the Bible (e.g., <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>), and this prophecy underscores God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to execute judgment swiftly.<p><b>Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights God's sovereign choice in appointing leaders or nations to fulfill His purposes. Throughout the Bible, God raises up individuals or nations to execute His will, whether for blessing or judgment (e.g., Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). The "chosen one" here could refer to a specific leader or nation that God will use as an instrument of judgment against Edom. This reflects the biblical theme of divine election and God's control over historical events.<p><b>For who is like Me, and who can challenge Me?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the uniqueness and supremacy of God. It echoes similar declarations found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>, where God asserts His unparalleled nature and authority. The rhetorical questions serve to remind the audience of God's unmatched power and the futility of opposing His will. This is a central theme in the Bible, where God's sovereignty and omnipotence are consistently affirmed.<p><b>What shepherd can stand against Me?&#8221;</b><br>The term "shepherd" is often used in the Bible to denote leaders or rulers (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2</a>). This question underscores the futility of any earthly leader attempting to oppose God's plans. It reflects the biblical understanding that all authority is ultimately subject to God's rule (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). The imagery of a shepherd also connects to the idea of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), who embodies the ultimate authority and care for His people. This phrase serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over all leaders and nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lion.htm">Lion</a></b><br>Symbolizes a powerful and fierce invader or leader, often used in the Bible to depict strength and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thickets_of_the_jordan.htm">Thickets of the Jordan</a></b><br>Refers to the dense, bushy areas along the Jordan River, often associated with danger and unpredictability.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/perennially_watered_pasture.htm">Perennially Watered Pasture</a></b><br>Symbolizes a place of abundance and prosperity, often targeted by invaders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invader.htm">The Invader</a></b><br>Represents God's chosen instrument of judgment, possibly referring to Nebuchadnezzar or another powerful leader.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority who appoints leaders and orchestrates events according to His sovereign will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and leaders.

Just as sheep feel safe until the lion pounces, Edom assumed its rocky terrain and alliances made it untouchable (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Underlying truth: when God appoints judgment, no earthly refuge can shield the sinner (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For in an instant I will chase Edom from her land</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;In an instant&#8221; underscores both speed and certainty (<a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5</a>; 47:9).<p>&#8226; God, not chance, is the active subject&#8212;&#8220;I will chase.&#8221; Though Babylon wielded the sword, the Lord directed the outcome (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s expulsion mirrors how Israel once dispossessed Canaan&#8217;s nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>).

The passage declares that God alone initiates, directs, and completes judgment; no nation, leader, or power can resist His sovereign will. For the faithful, this is both a warning against complacency and a comfort that the Lord&#8217;s righteous plans cannot be thwarted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Like a lion from the swelling of Jordan.--</span>Better, as in <a href="/jeremiah/12-5.htm" title="If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein you trusted, they wearied you, then how will you do in the swelling of Jordan?">Jeremiah 12:5</a>, <span class= "ital">the pride of Jordan</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the thick jungle-forests which were the glory of its banks.<p><span class= "bld">Against the habitation of the strong.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">against the evergreen pasturage. </span>The word for "habitation" is that used in <a href="/jeremiah/6-2.htm" title="I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.">Jeremiah 6:2</a> for the place where shepherds encamp, the other substantive conveys the idea of permanence rather than strength, and the image by which the prophet paints the Chaldaean invasion is that of a lion (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm" title="Why a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goes out there shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.">Jeremiah 5:6</a>) making its way through the jungle, and rushing upon the flocks and herds in one of the meadow tracts along the course of the Jordan.<p><span class= "bld">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I will wink, I will make him . . .</span> The pronouns are obscure in the Hebrew as in the English, but the meaning seems to be, "I will, as in the twinkling of an eye, drive him (Edom) away from it" (his pasturage, or habitation).<p><span class= "bld">And who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">who is a chosen one, and I will appoint him<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span>? The word translated "chosen one" is commonly associated with the idea of youth, the flower of a nation's strength, its chosen champions. Commentators for the most part apply it to Nebuchadnezzar as being, in the full vigour of his strength, the chosen ruler whom Jehovah would appoint over Edom. The interrogative form, however, and the implied negative answer to the questions that follow suggest a different interpretation. "Who," the prophet asks in a tone of scorn, as though Jehovah spoke by him, "is a chosen champion of Edom? and I will appoint him." The implied answer is that Edom has no such champion. Compare the taunting words uttered by Jehu (<a href="/context/2_kings/10-2.htm" title="Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master's sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;">2Kings 10:2-3</a>)--"Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons"--and Rabshakeh (<a href="/2_kings/18-23.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.">2Kings 18:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-22.</span> - Figures descriptive of the unique physical qualities of the destined conqueror of Edom.

The root-meaning is simply "continuance," whether it be continuance of strength (comp. <a href="/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. <span class="cmt_word">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span> Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this "obscure and much-vexed passage," as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in <a href="/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a> we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either <span class="accented">read</span> (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), "For I will suddenly make them run away from it" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading "him" for "them," and explain "him" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for "suddenly" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, "in the twinkling of an eye." <span class="cmt_word">And who is a chosen man,</span> etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, "and will appoint over it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Edom] him who is chosen," viz. Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Who will appoint me the time?</span> The same phrase is rendered in <a href="/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>, "Who shall set me a time to plead?" (comp. the Latin phrase <span class="accented">dicur dicere</span>). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, <span class="cmt_word">Who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp.
