His role as a priest would have involved religious duties and maintaining the spiritual life of the community. The mention of Zephaniah highlights the religious leadership in Jerusalem during the Babylonian exile. This context is important as it shows the tension between the prophetic messages of Jeremiah and the established religious order. Zephaniah is also mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/21.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a>, indicating his involvement in significant events of the time.<p><b>had read this letter</b><br>The letter referred to is likely the one Jeremiah sent to the exiles in Babylon, as recorded earlier in <a href="/jeremiah/29.htm">Jeremiah 29</a>. This letter contained God's instructions and promises to the exiles, including the famous verse <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>, which speaks of God's plans for hope and a future. The act of reading the letter publicly would have been a way to communicate God's message to the people, emphasizing the importance of written communication in maintaining faith and hope during the exile.<p><b>to Jeremiah the prophet.</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," was called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to Judah. His prophetic ministry spanned the reigns of several kings and included the period leading up to and during the Babylonian exile. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to speak God's truth, often in the face of opposition and disbelief. The mention of Jeremiah here underscores his central role in conveying God's word to both those in Jerusalem and the exiles in Babylon. His prophecies often pointed to the coming of a new covenant, which Christians see fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as referenced in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Israelites to Babylon.

Zephaniah follows that tradition by letting Jeremiah hear every word.<p>&#8226; The act shifts the narrative: instead of Jeremiah being condemned, the letter itself is weighed and found wanting, preparing for God&#8217;s verdict in <a href="/jeremiah/29-31.htm">Jeremiah 29:31-32</a>.<p>&#8226; Transparency protects God&#8217;s people; compare Paul&#8217;s insistence on openness in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jeremiah the prophet</b><p>&#8226; By reading &#8220;to Jeremiah the prophet,&#8221; Zephaniah acknowledges Jeremiah&#8217;s God-given office (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).
