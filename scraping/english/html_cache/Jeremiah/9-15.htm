The phrase "the God of Israel" reminds the people of their covenant relationship with God, which they have violated, leading to the pronouncement of judgment.<p><b>Behold, I will feed this people wormwood:</b><br>Wormwood is a bitter plant often associated with sorrow and calamity. In biblical symbolism, it represents divine judgment and bitterness of life due to sin.

This imagery is also found in <a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15</a>, where wormwood signifies the bitterness of suffering and judgment.<p><b>and give them poisoned water to drink:</b><br>The poisoned water symbolizes the severe consequences of turning away from God.

This imagery is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where water was turned to blood, rendering it undrinkable (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>).

By naming Himself this way, the Lord reminds Judah that:<p>&#8226; He commands all heavenly armies (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>) and therefore has unlimited power to enforce His words.<p>&#8226; He is still their covenant God (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>), the One who lovingly chose Israel yet now must discipline them for covenant breach (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>Because the statement begins with &#8220;Therefore,&#8221; it attaches directly to the previous verses, where Judah&#8217;s deceit, idolatry, and refusal to repent have provoked divine wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13&#8211;14</a>). God&#8217;s impending action flows from righteous judgment, not caprice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, I will feed this people wormwood</b><p>&#8220;Behold&#8221; calls for focused attention: something startling follows. Wormwood is a bitter desert shrub; its taste makes food unpalatable and can symbolize sorrow and calamity (<a href="/proverbs/5-4.htm">Proverbs 5:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-19.htm">Lamentations 3:19</a>). When God says He will feed the nation wormwood:<p>&#8226; He promises that life&#8217;s &#8220;menu&#8221; will turn unbearably bitter&#8212;exile, famine, grief (<a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21&#8211;22</a>; 16:4&#8211;6).<p>&#8226; The imagery echoes earlier covenant warnings: disobedience would plant a &#8220;root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Later prophets pick up the same metaphor for judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/23-15.htm">Jeremiah 23:15</a>) and Revelation uses wormwood for global catastrophe (<a href="/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>Thus the Lord is declaring that Judah&#8217;s chosen sins will now become the bitterness they must ingest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give them poisoned water to drink.</b><p>Moving from food to water intensifies the picture: essential sustenance becomes lethal. Jeremiah elsewhere records the people&#8217;s fear of drinking water laden with divine wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a>). God&#8217;s words stress:<p>&#8226; Comprehensive judgment&#8212;what should sustain life (water) will instead bring harm, recalling the plagues of Egypt when the Nile turned to blood (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; Inescapability&#8212;everyone needs water; therefore no one will avoid the consequences (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15&#8211;16</a>, &#8220;Take this cup of the wine of My wrath and make all the nations drink&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment of covenant curses&#8212;&#8220;The LORD will send on you curses&#8230;until you are destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>). Physical hardship, military defeat, and spiritual despair will flow together like a poisoned stream.<p>The phrase underscores that Judah&#8217;s rebellion has contaminated even the basic fabric of daily life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a> is God&#8217;s sober verdict on a people who persistently spurned His truth. The Lord of Hosts&#8212;fully able to carry out His decree&#8212;announces that Judah will taste the bitterness of wormwood and the deadly sting of tainted water. These vivid images portray comprehensive, covenant-driven judgment: life itself will turn bitter and lethal because sin has saturated the nation. Yet even in pronouncing discipline, God&#8217;s titles remind His people that He remains their covenant Lord, ready to restore when repentance comes (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; 31:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Wormwood.</span>--As a plant, probably a species of <span class= "ital">Artemisia, </span>four species of which are found in Palestine.
