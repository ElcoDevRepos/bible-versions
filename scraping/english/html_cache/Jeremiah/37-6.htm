The phrase underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, emphasizing that it originates from God Himself. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God speaks directly to His prophets, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>. It highlights the role of the prophet as a mouthpiece for God, delivering messages that often include warnings, guidance, or future events.<p><b>to Jeremiah the prophet:</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," served during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, spanning the reigns of several kings, including Zedekiah. His ministry was marked by messages of impending judgment due to the people's unfaithfulness and idolatry. Jeremiah's role as a prophet was not only to foretell future events but also to call the people back to covenant faithfulness. His life and ministry are chronicled in the Book of Jeremiah, which provides insight into the socio-political and religious climate of the time. Jeremiah's prophecies often foreshadow the coming of Christ, as he speaks of a new covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.

Previously, King Zedekiah sent messengers asking Jeremiah to pray as the Babylonian siege seemed to lift when Egypt&#8217;s army appeared (<a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; shows God did not leave His people guessing; He addressed the very situation at hand, just as He had stepped in at key junctures before (<a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that divine revelation often arrives right in the middle of confusion or false hope, paralleling how God spoke &#8220;then&#8221; in crises such as at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>) or during Elijah&#8217;s drought (<a href="/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; What Jeremiah receives is not human speculation but God-breathed truth&#8212;&#8220;the word of the LORD stands forever&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase underscores authority; Jeremiah has no liberty to soften or alter it (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly highlights that God&#8217;s word cuts through deception (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>) and never fails in its purpose (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>). Here it will expose Judah&#8217;s misplaced confidence in Egypt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came</b><p>&#8226; God initiates; Jeremiah does not conjure a message. Like earlier occasions&#8212;&#8220;the word of the LORD came to me, saying&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>)&#8212;revelation is an act of grace.<p>&#8226; The verb reassures that God is actively involved, not distant (<a href="/psalms/147-15.htm">Psalm 147:15</a>). When His word &#8220;comes,&#8221; history moves, hearts are tested, and destinies shift (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>; <a href="/acts/11-12.htm">Acts 11:12</a>).<p>&#8226; In this chapter, that coming word will overturn the court prophets&#8217; optimistic forecasts (<a href="/jeremiah/37-19.htm">Jeremiah 37:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Jeremiah</b><p>&#8226; The message targets God&#8217;s chosen servant, the same man formed for this task before birth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Receiving rather than inventing, Jeremiah embodies faithful stewardship (<a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a>; 20:9).<p>&#8226; His personal obedience amid persecution (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15</a>) echoes Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>) and Paul before Felix (<a href="/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the prophet</b><p>&#8226; The title stresses office and responsibility.

Jeremiah&#8217;s prophetic mantle sets him apart as the lone truthful voice, like Micaiah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8-14</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling him &#8220;the prophet,&#8221; Scripture reminds readers that God still provides clear, authoritative guidance even when culture resists it (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6</a> may look like a simple introductory line, yet each phrase pulses with meaning.

It is the LORD&#8217;s own utterance, carrying full authority, actively &#8220;coming&#8221; to engage real history. The message finds its mark in Jeremiah, the faithful prophet uniquely commissioned to relay truth despite hostility. Together these elements affirm that whenever confusion reigns, God still speaks plainly, guiding His people through voices He Himself appoints and empowering His word to accomplish exactly what He intends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jeremiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;m&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3414.htm">Strong's 3414: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeremiah -- 'Yah loosens', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the prophet:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5030.htm">Strong's 5030: </a> </span><span class="str2">A spokesman, speaker, prophet</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/37-6.htm">Jeremiah 37:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/37-6.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 37:6 Then came the word of Yahweh (Jer.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Jeremiah 37:5"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 37:5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Jeremiah 37:7"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 37:7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
