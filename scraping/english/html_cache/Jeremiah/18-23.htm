This reflects the broader context of Jeremiah's ministry, where he faced significant opposition from his own people, including priests and prophets (<a href="/jeremiah/11-18.htm">Jeremiah 11:18-19</a>). The phrase underscores God's omniscience, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God is depicted as knowing all thoughts and actions. The "deadly plots" highlight the severity of the opposition, which is not just verbal but life-threatening, similar to the threats faced by other prophets like Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19:1-2</a>).<p><b>Do not wipe out their guilt or blot out their sin from Your sight.</b><br>Jeremiah's plea for justice is rooted in the covenantal understanding of sin and retribution. In the Old Testament, sin is often seen as a breach of covenant with God, requiring divine justice (Deuteronomy 28). The request not to "wipe out their guilt" aligns with the principle of divine justice, where unrepentant sin remains before God (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>). This contrasts with the New Testament message of forgiveness through Christ, where sins are blotted out for those who repent (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>).<p><b>Let them be overthrown before You;</b><br>This phrase calls for divine intervention and judgment. The concept of being "overthrown" is reminiscent of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>), where divine wrath resulted in total destruction. Jeremiah's appeal is for a similar decisive action against his adversaries, reflecting the prophetic tradition of calling for God's justice against wickedness (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>).<p><b>deal with them in the time of Your anger.</b><br>The "time of Your anger" refers to the period of divine judgment, often associated with the "Day of the LORD" in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9</a>). This is a time when God executes justice and righteousness, punishing the wicked and vindicating the righteous. Jeremiah's invocation of God's anger is consistent with the prophetic call for God to act against injustice and sin, as seen in <a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>, where God's wrath is described as a response to evil. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment at the end of times, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Nothing about the conspiracy against him escapes the Lord&#8217;s sight (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s omniscience provides comfort: He sees both the hidden schemes and Jeremiah&#8217;s innocence, assuring the prophet that justice will be based on full, exact information (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, this truth guards us from despair when opposition feels unseen or misunderstood (<a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Do not wipe out their guilt or blot out their sin from Your sight.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah appeals for divine justice rather than personal revenge. He asks that the offenders&#8217; guilt not be erased, echoing imprecatory prayers like <a href="/psalms/69-27.htm">Psalm 69:27&#8211;28</a>.<p>&#8226; Such petitions align with God&#8217;s revealed character: He &#8220;will by no means leave the guilty unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The request underscores human limits&#8212;only God can judge hearts impartially (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). Jeremiah entrusts the matter to the Lord instead of taking matters into his own hands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah seeks a visible vindication that shows God&#8217;s righteousness to the watching nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35&#8211;36</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Time of Your anger&#8221; points to a definitive moment when God&#8217;s wrath justly falls on persistent rebellion (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-17.htm">Revelation 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, divine anger is never capricious; it is measured, purposeful, and always consistent with God&#8217;s holiness (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s plea anticipates the ultimate triumph of God&#8217;s kingdom, when evil is finally and fully overthrown (<a href="/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a> shows the prophet placing his peril and his persecutors entirely in God&#8217;s hands. He trusts the Lord&#8217;s omniscience, appeals for unblotted guilt to ensure true justice, and asks for God&#8217;s decisive intervention at the appointed time of wrath. The verse teaches believers to rely on God&#8217;s perfect knowledge, to leave judgment with Him, and to rest in the certainty that He will vindicate righteousness and punish unrepentant evil according to His holy timetable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their counsel . . .</span>--Secret as their plots had been, they were not hidden from Jehovah, nor, indeed, as the words show, from the prophet himself.

So afterwards, in the Gospel history, the conspiracies that began at Capernaum (<a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>) were developed in Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/27-1.htm" title="When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:">Matthew 27:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Deal thus with them.</span>--The interpolated word "thus," intended to emphasise the prayer, really weakens it: <span class= "ital">in the. time of Thine anger deal with them, </span>as implying that the day of grace was past, that nothing now remained but retribution. The prayer was the utterance of an indignation, not unrighteous in itself, yet showing all too plainly, as has been said above, like the language of the so-called imprecatory Psalms, the contrast between the Jewish and the Christian and Christ-like way of meeting wrong and hatred. For us such prayers are among the things that have passed away, and we have learnt to admire and imitate the nobler temper of the proto-martyr, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge" (<a href="/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.">Acts 7:60</a>). The New Testament utterances of St. Peter against Simon the sorcerer (<a href="/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>), of St. Paul against Ananias (<a href="/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>), the Judaisers of Galatia (<a href="/galatians/1-9.htm" title="As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel to you than that you have received, let him be accursed.">Galatians 1:9</a>), and Alexander the coppersmith (<a href="/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2Timothy 4:14</a>), present an apparent parallelism; but the words spoken in these cases have more the character of an authoritative judicial sentence. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let them be overthrown before thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> count them as those who have been brought to ruin.
