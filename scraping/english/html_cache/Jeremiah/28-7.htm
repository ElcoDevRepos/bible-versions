Here, he emphasizes the importance of listening to God's true message. The word "nevertheless" indicates a contrast to the false assurances given by Hananiah, a false prophet. This highlights the biblical theme of discerning truth from falsehood, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where God outlines the criteria for true prophecy.<p><b>I am speaking in your hearing</b><br>Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to deliver God's word directly to the people, often in public settings. This phrase underscores the immediacy and personal nature of prophetic messages. The public proclamation is significant, as it holds the prophet accountable and allows the community to witness and judge the prophecy's fulfillment, aligning with the communal aspects of Hebrew society.<p><b>and in the hearing of all the people</b><br>The message is not just for the leaders or a select few but for the entire community. This inclusivity reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the entire nation is called to obedience. It also serves as a public testimony, ensuring that all are aware of God's warnings and promises, similar to the public readings of the Law in <a href="/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>.
