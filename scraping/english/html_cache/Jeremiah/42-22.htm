It emphasizes the inevitability of the consequences that are about to be described. In the biblical context, it reflects the prophetic authority of Jeremiah, who is delivering God's message. The certainty of God's word is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is said to accomplish what He desires.<p><b>that by sword and famine and plague</b><br>These three calamities are often mentioned together in the Bible as instruments of divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>). The sword represents warfare and violence, famine indicates a lack of food and sustenance, and plague suggests disease and pestilence. Historically, these were common threats in the ancient Near East, often resulting from or leading to each other. They symbolize comprehensive destruction and are used to convey the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>you will die</b><br>This phrase underscores the finality and seriousness of the judgment. Death is the ultimate consequence of sin and rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The inevitability of death in this context serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>in the place where you desire to go to reside</b><br>This refers to the people's intention to flee to Egypt for safety, against God's explicit command to remain in Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a>). Egypt, historically a place of refuge and a symbol of worldly security, is ironically portrayed as a place of death for those who disobey God. This reflects a broader biblical theme where reliance on human strength and foreign alliances, rather than on God, leads to downfall (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). Egypt's historical role as both a place of refuge and a place of bondage (as in the Exodus) adds depth to this warning, highlighting the futility of seeking security outside of God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people. He is often called the "weeping prophet" due to his deep sorrow over the fate of his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The group of Israelites who remained in Judah after the Babylonian conquest. They sought guidance from Jeremiah about whether to flee to Egypt for safety.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah desired to flee, seeking refuge from the Babylonian threat. Historically, Egypt was often seen as a place of refuge but also a place of bondage and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword,_famine,_and_plague.htm">Sword, Famine, and Plague</a></b><br>These are the three forms of judgment that God declares will follow the remnant if they disobey His command to stay in Judah. They symbolize the comprehensive nature of divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_conquest.htm">Babylonian Conquest</a></b><br>The historical backdrop of this passage, where Babylon, under King Nebuchadnezzar, conquered Jerusalem, leading to the exile of many Jews.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>The remnant's desire to flee to Egypt despite God's warning highlights the importance of trusting and obeying God's instructions, even when they seem counterintuitive.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The promise of sword, famine, and plague serves as a stark reminder that disobedience to God leads to severe consequences. It underscores the seriousness of sin and the reality of divine judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>The remnant's fear of staying in Judah reflects a lack of trust in God's ability to protect them. Believers are encouraged to place their trust in God rather than in human solutions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_seeking_worldly_refuge.htm">The Danger of Seeking Worldly Refuge</a></b><br>Egypt symbolizes reliance on worldly powers and solutions. Christians are reminded to seek refuge in God rather than in the temporary security offered by the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>The passage affirms God's control over nations and events.

Because the remnant asked for guidance and then hardened their hearts, the Lord moves from invitation to warning (cf. <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Therefore&#8221; alerts us that divine consequences always flow from our choices&#8212;especially when we have been clearly shown the right path and refuse it (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>know for sure</b><p>&#8226; God leaves no room for uncertainty. His words are not suggestions but settled fact (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The certainty stresses personal accountability; they cannot claim ignorance (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar emphatic warnings appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58-59</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>, underscoring that when God speaks, fulfillment is inevitable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that by sword and famine and plague</b><p>&#8226; These three judgments often appear together as the Lord&#8217;s disciplinary arsenal against persistent rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; 24:10; <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Sword&#8212;military invasion; famine&#8212;economic collapse; plague&#8212;disease: a comprehensive dismantling of every earthly security (<a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The sequence reminds us that disobedience opens multiple doors to destruction, not just one (<a href="/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will die</b><p>&#8226; The outcome is final and physical. God is not describing mere discomfort but termination of life (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>).<p>&#8226; His justice is not capricious; the remnant had vowed to obey whatever He said (<a href="/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5-6</a>) yet planned the opposite. Breaking sworn obedience invites covenant curses (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also exposes a false hope: they thought Egypt would guarantee survival, but only submission to God does that (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the place where you desire to go to reside</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;place&#8221; is Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/42-14.htm">Jeremiah 42:14</a>), symbolizing human schemes to escape hardship.<p>&#8226; Desire does not equal divine approval (<a href="/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4-6</a>). When preference overrides obedience, the very refuge we choose becomes a tomb (<a href="/jeremiah/44-12.htm">Jeremiah 44:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God knows motives as well as actions (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>).
