The context is the promise of restoration for Israel after a period of exile and punishment. The act of returning signifies a change of heart and a turning back to God, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, especially in the prophetic books. The Hebrew concept of repentance, "teshuvah," involves a complete turning away from sin and a return to God. This mirrors the prodigal son&#8217;s return in <a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>, emphasizing God&#8217;s readiness to forgive and restore.<p><b>and after I was instructed,</b><br>Instruction here implies a process of learning and understanding God&#8217;s ways, often through discipline or correction. In the historical context, Israel's exile served as a period of instruction, teaching them the consequences of their disobedience. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, which speaks of the Lord&#8217;s discipline as an act of love. The instruction is not merely academic but transformative, leading to a deeper relationship with God.<p><b>I struck my thigh in grief.</b><br>Striking the thigh is an expression of deep sorrow and regret, a cultural gesture of mourning and repentance in ancient Near Eastern societies. This physical act symbolizes the internal anguish and acknowledgment of wrongdoing. It is similar to the public displays of mourning seen in other parts of the Bible, such as tearing clothes or wearing sackcloth, as seen in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> and <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a>.<p><b>I was ashamed and humiliated</b><br>Shame and humiliation are common responses to sin and its consequences. In the biblical context, these feelings are not just personal but communal, affecting the entire nation of Israel. The acknowledgment of shame is a step towards redemption, as it reflects a recognition of sin and a desire for reconciliation with God. This is echoed in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, where David expresses deep remorse for his sins.<p><b>because I bore the disgrace of my youth.&#8217;</b><br>The disgrace of youth refers to the past sins and rebellious actions of Israel, often depicted as spiritual adultery or idolatry. This phrase highlights the long-lasting impact of sin and the need for genuine repentance. The historical context involves Israel&#8217;s repeated turning away from God to worship other deities, leading to their downfall and exile. This is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, where Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness is portrayed as a youthful indiscretion that brings shame. The acknowledgment of past disgrace is crucial for moving forward in God&#8217;s plan of restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of repentance and hope to the people of Judah during a time of impending judgment and exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Often used as a representative name for the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Ephraim here symbolizes the people of Israel who have strayed from God but are now returning in repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>A central theme in this verse, highlighting the turning away from sin and returning to God, accompanied by a deep sense of remorse and shame for past actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/instruction.htm">Instruction</a></b><br>The process of being taught or corrected, which leads to a realization of one's sins and the need for repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/disgrace_of_youth.htm">Disgrace of Youth</a></b><br>Refers to the past sins and rebellious actions committed during a time of spiritual immaturity, which now bring shame upon reflection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_repentance.htm">The Necessity of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a heartfelt acknowledgment of sin and a sincere turning back to God.

The word &#8220;returned&#8221; points to a literal, physical and spiritual coming home, just as foretold in <a href="/jeremiah/31-17.htm">Jeremiah 31:17</a>, &#8220;Your children will return to their own land.&#8221;<p>- Scripture often links return with God&#8217;s initiative: <a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1-2</a> calls, &#8220;Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God,&#8221; while <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a> pictures the father running to the prodigal son. God&#8217;s faithfulness makes return possible.<p>- For every believer, turning back is not theoretical. It means abandoning the path that led away and planting both feet in the Father&#8217;s house again (<a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I repented</b><p>- Repentance follows the return. It is the heartfelt change of mind and life. <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a> urges, &#8220;Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be wiped out.&#8221;<p>- True repentance embraces confession (<a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>) and a desire to walk in obedience (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>).<p>- This repentance is not forced; it wells up because God&#8217;s kindness leads us to it (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After I was instructed</b><p>- God does not leave His people in ignorance; instruction follows repentance. <a href="/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a> promises, &#8220;Your ears will hear this command behind you: &#8216;This is the way; walk in it.&#8217;&#8221;<p>- The law written on the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>) illuminates the path.<p>- In the Christian life, the Spirit takes the role of Instructor, guiding into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I struck my thigh in grief</b><p>- The gesture shows deep mourning and shock over sin&#8217;s ugliness. Similar expressions appear in <a href="/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>, &#8220;Strike the thigh in grief,&#8221; depicting sudden realization of guilt.<p>- Godly sorrow produces repentance without regret (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). The outward action mirrors the inward pain of having offended a holy God.<p>- Such grief is not self-condemnation but a healthy recognition that sin matters (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was ashamed and humiliated</b><p>- Shame is the natural response when holy light exposes former darkness (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-8.htm">Daniel 9:8</a>).<p>- The LORD uses this moment to purify, not to paralyze. <a href="/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a> asks, &#8220;What fruit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of?&#8221; The contrast heightens gratitude for mercy.<p>- Knowing Christ bore our shame (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>) lifts our heads while keeping our hearts humble.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because I bore the disgrace of my youth</b><p>- Israel&#8217;s earlier idolatries left scars (<a href="/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24-25</a>).

Each step reveals a Father who calls, cleanses, teaches, and restores. The verse invites every believer to keep short accounts with God, welcome His correction, and rejoice that He turns our deepest shame into testimony of His unfailing grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">After that I was turned.</span>--The words have been referred by some commentators (Hitzig) to the previous turning away from God--the apostasy of Ephraim; but the repetition of the word that had been used in the previous verse makes it far more natural to connect it with the first movement of repentance. The "smiting upon the thigh" is, like the Publican's "smiting on his breast" (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>), an Eastern expression of extremest grief. So in <a href="/ezekiel/21-17.htm" title="I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.">Ezekiel 21:17</a> we have the "smiting of the hands together" as a symbol of anger, which is also sorrow. In Homer (<span class= "ital">Odyss. </span>xiii. 193) we have the very gesture here depicted--<p>"And then he groaned, and smote on both his thighs<p>With headlong hands, and so in sorrow spoke."<p><span class= "bld">The reproach of my youth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the shame which the sins of his youth had brought upon him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After that I was turned, I repented;</span> rather, <span class="accented">after my turning away</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> <a href="/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Jeremiah 8:4</a>), I have <span class="accented">repented.</span> It is a different kind of "turning" which is here meant, a turning away from God. <span class="cmt_word">I was instructed;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I was made to know</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought to my senses by punishment. <span class="cmt_word">I smote upon my thigh;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I have smitten</span>, etc. Ephraim describes his present state of mind, and the symbols by which he translates it into act.
