In ancient times, a loincloth was a common garment, signifying readiness and service. The act of purchasing and wearing it suggests a deliberate choice and personal investment, reflecting how God chose Israel as His own. This imagery is used to illustrate Israel's initial closeness to God and their subsequent corruption.<p><b>and go at once to Perath</b><br>Perath is commonly understood to refer to the Euphrates River, a significant geographical landmark in biblical history. The Euphrates was a boundary of the Promised Land and a symbol of the far reaches of God's influence. The journey to Perath signifies a significant and purposeful action, possibly indicating the distance Israel has strayed from God. Some scholars suggest a closer location, such as a site near Anathoth, Jeremiah's hometown, due to the impracticality of the journey. This ambiguity highlights the mystery and depth of God's instructions.<p><b>and hide it there in a crevice of the rocks</b><br>Hiding the loincloth in a crevice symbolizes the concealment and eventual corruption of Israel's relationship with God. Rocks often represent strength and permanence, yet the act of hiding suggests neglect and decay. This imagery foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, where Israel's pride and glory would be marred. The act of hiding also connects to themes of sin and separation from God, as seen in other scriptures where hidden sins lead to downfall.

The pristine loincloth pictured Israel&#8217;s intended purity and closeness to God. Its concealment near Babylon foreshadowed exile; its eventual ruin exposed the inevitable outcome of pride and disobedience. The passage calls God&#8217;s people to remain clinging, visible, and obedient, remembering that when intimacy with the Lord is abandoned, usefulness and honor soon decay.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Go to Euphrates.</span>--The Hebrew word <span class= "ital">Phrath </span>is the same as that which, everywhere else in the O.T., is rendered by the Greek name for the river, Euphrates. It has been suggested (1) that the word means "river" generally, or "rushing water," applied by way of pre-eminence to the "great river" and therefore that it may have been used here in its general sense; and (2) that it may stand here for Ephratah, or Bethlehem, as the scene of Jeremiah's symbolic actions, the place being chosen on account of its suggestive likeness to Euphrates. These conjectures, however, have no other basis than the assumed improbability of a double journey of two hundred and fifty miles, and this, as has been shown, can hardly be weighed as a serious element in the question. In Jeremiah 51 there can be no doubt that the writer means Euphrates. It may be noted, too, as a coincidence confirming this view, that Jeremiah appears as personally known to Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/jeremiah/39-11.htm" title="Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,">Jeremiah 39:11</a>. Those who make Ephratah the scene of what is here recorded, point to the caves and clefts in the rocky region between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea as agreeing with the description. On the other hand, the form <span class= "ital">Prath </span>is nowhere found as substituted for the familiar Ephratah.<p><span class= "bld">A hole of the rock.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">cleft. </span>In the lower part of its course the Euphrates flows through an alluvial plain, and the words point therefore to some part of its upper course above Pylae, where its course is through a valley more or less rocky.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-6.</span> - After Jeremiah has worn the apron for some time, he is directed to take it to <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, and hide it there in a cleft (not "hole") of the rock. A long interval elapses, and he is commanded to make a second journey to the same place, and fetch away the apron. What does this <span class="accented">P'rath</span> mean? It is by no means easy to decide. Hardly "the Euphrates," <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the common prefix, "the river," is wanting, though in so extraordinary a narrative it was peculiarly needed; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because of the length of the journey to Babylonia, which has ex hyp. to be made twice; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the Euphrates is not a rocky river. Ewald suggested that "some wet place near Jerusalem" probably had the name of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, and indicates a valley and spring called Forah, about six English miles north-east of Jerusalem. Mr. Birch appears to have hit independently on the same spot, which he identifies with the Parah of <a href="/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>, about three miles north-east of Anatbeth, and describes as a picturesque gorge between savage rocks, with a copious stream (<span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, October, 1880, p. 236). This combination, however, involves an emendation of the text (<span class="accented">P'rath</span> into <span class="accented">Parah</span>) <span class="accented">- logically</span> it involves this, as Mr. Birch has seen; Ewald's comparison of the Arabic <span class="accented">furat</span>, sweet water, seems inconsistent with his reference to Parah - for which there does not seem to be sufficient necessity; and it is better to adopt the view of the great old French Protestant scholar, Bochart, that <span class="accented">P'rath</span> is a shortened form of Ephrath, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at once Bethlehem and the district in which Bethlehem lay (see <a href="/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>; and perhaps <a href="/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>). It need hardly be said that the limestone hills of this region afforded abundance of secluded rocks. There may, of course, be at the same time an allusion to the ordinary meaning of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, viz. Euphrates, on the analogy of the allusion in <a href="/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>. Those who hold the view here rejected, that <span class="accented">P'rath is</span> equivalent to the Euphrates, sometimes suppose that the narrative is a parable or symbolical fiction, such as Luther, Calvin, and others find in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 3</a>, the thing signified being in this case the carrying captive of the people to Babylon; and this seems the best way of making this interpretation plausible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/13-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1447;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the loincloth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1494;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;z&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
