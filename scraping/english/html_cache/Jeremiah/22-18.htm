Jehoiakim's reign was marked by idolatry and injustice, contrasting sharply with his father's reforms. The LORD's message through Jeremiah highlights the seriousness of Jehoiakim's actions and the resulting judgment. Historically, Jehoiakim ruled during a turbulent period, facing threats from Babylon and Egypt, which influenced his political decisions and alliances.<p><b>They will not mourn for him: &#8216;Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!&#8217;</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern cultures, mourning was a significant social and familial duty, often involving public displays of grief. The absence of mourning for Jehoiakim indicates a lack of respect and affection from his people and family. This reflects his failure as a leader and the alienation he caused through his oppressive rule. The expressions "my brother" and "my sister" suggest that even those closest to him will not lament his passing, highlighting his isolation.<p><b>They will not mourn for him: &#8216;Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of the lack of mourning underscores the depth of Jehoiakim's disgrace. The terms "my master" and "his splendor" would typically denote respect and admiration for a king. However, Jehoiakim's reign did not inspire such sentiments. His oppressive policies and disregard for God's covenant led to a legacy devoid of honor. This phrase also serves as a prophetic warning to future leaders about the consequences of forsaking God's ways. The absence of lamentation for his "splendor" suggests that his achievements and wealth were ultimately meaningless in the eyes of God and his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The son of King Josiah and king of Judah, known for his disobedience to God and oppressive reign.

Though born to a righteous father, Jehoiakim&#8217;s choices invite a death devoid of mourning, stripping him of royal honor and exposing him as a cautionary tale. The verse upholds divine justice&#8212;assuring the faithful that God sees, remembers, and repays every deed (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>), and urging each heart to humble obedience before the true King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">They shall not lament for him.</span>--The words contrast the death as well as the life of Jehoiakim with that of Josiah. For him there should be no lamentation such as was made for the righteous king (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2Chronicles 35:25</a>), either from kindred mourning, as over a brother or a sister (perhaps, however, as "sister" would not be appropriate to the king, the words are those of a chorus of mourners, male and female, addressing each other), or from subjects wailing over the death of their "lord" and the departure of his "glory." For the funeral ceremonies of Israel, see <a href="/1_kings/13-30.htm" title="And he laid his carcass in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!">1Kings 13:30</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-23.htm" title="And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,">Matthew 9:23</a>; <a href="/mark/5-38.htm" title="And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.">Mark 5:38</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Josiah had been bitterly missed and universally lamented (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>); and so, only perhaps with less heartiness in most cases, Jehoiakim's other predecessors (<a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). The Babylonian kings, too, received the honors of public mourning, e.g. even the last of his race, who surrendered to Cyrus, according to the British Museum inscription translated by Mr. Pinches. <span class="cmt_word">Ah my brother! or, Ah sister!</span> The Septuagint omits the latter part of this phrase, apparently because it seemed inappropriate to the death of Jehoiakim; but the parallelism requires a two-membered clause. According to Movers, the funeral procession is to be conceived of as formed of two parts, condoling with each other on having to share the same fate ('Die Phonizier,' 2. 248). Or perhaps mythology may supply a reason; it is possible that the formulae of public mourning were derived from the ceremonies of the Adonia; Adonis was an androgynous deity (Lenormant, 'Lettres assyriologiques,' 2:209), and might be lamented by his devotees as at once "brother" and "sister." (For another view, see Sayco's edition of G. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,' p. 267). Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13</a>) testifies to the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis, and the highest compliment a king could receive might be to be lamented in the same terms as the sun-god. Jeremiah does not approve this; he merely describes the popular custom. The recognition of the deeply rooted heathenism of the Jews before the Exile involves no disparagement to Old Testament religion; rather it increases the cogency of the argument for its supernatural origin. For how great was the contrast between Jeremiah and his semi-heathen countrymen! And yet Jeremiah's religion is the seed of the faith which overcame the world. <span class="cmt_word">Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> Lord is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">adon</span> (comp. Adonis and see above). <span class="accented">His glory</span> is against the parallelism; we should expect "lady" or "queen." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
