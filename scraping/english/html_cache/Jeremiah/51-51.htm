This shame is not just personal but communal, as the nation collectively feels the weight of their sin and the consequences that have followed. The reproach they have heard likely refers to the taunts and scorn from surrounding nations, who have witnessed Judah's downfall. This echoes the broader biblical theme of Israel's shame due to disobedience, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/36-30.htm">Ezekiel 36:30-32</a>, where God promises to restore Israel despite their shame.<p><b>disgrace has covered our faces,</b><br>The imagery of disgrace covering their faces suggests a profound sense of dishonor and defeat. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the face was often associated with one's identity and honor. To have one's face covered in disgrace indicates a loss of status and respect. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of sin leading to shame, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, where Adam and Eve cover themselves after sinning.<p><b>because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD&#8217;s house.</b><br>The entry of foreigners into the holy places signifies a deep desecration of what was sacred. The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and the dwelling place of God's presence. The invasion by foreigners, likely referring to the Babylonians, represents not only a physical conquest but a spiritual violation. This event fulfills earlier prophecies of judgment, such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/7-14.htm">Jeremiah 7:14-15</a>, where God warns of the temple's destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness. The desecration of the temple prefigures the ultimate cleansing and restoration through Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), symbolizing the new covenant and the indwelling of God's presence in believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.

Can anything wipe off the stain of that disgrace? The prophet had known the bitterness of that thought himself (<a href="/lamentations/1-10.htm" title="The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things: for she has seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom you did command that they should not enter into your congregation.">Lamentations 1:10</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-7.htm" title="The LORD has cast off his altar, he has abhorred his sanctuary, he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.">Lamentations 2:7</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-12.htm" title="The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.">Lamentations 4:12</a>), and had learnt how to deal with it: "Yes," he answers in the next verse, "there is comfort in the thought of retribution. The idol-temples which had been enriched with the spoils of their Temple shall be despoiled; the plunderers shall fall by the sword of the destroyer."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We are confounded.</span> A reflection of the exiles, expressing their deep shame at the ignominy which has been their lot. <span class="cmt_word">Are come;</span> or, <span class="accented">came.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;We are ashamed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1434;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_954.htm">Strong's 954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pale, to be ashamed, to be disappointed, delayed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reproach;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;er&#183;p&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2781.htm">Strong's 2781: </a> </span><span class="str2">Contumely, disgrace, the pudenda</span><br /><br /><span class="word">disgrace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;lim&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3639.htm">Strong's 3639: </a> </span><span class="str2">Insult, reproach, ignominy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has covered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(kis&#183;s&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3680.htm">Strong's 3680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To plump, fill up hollows, to cover</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our faces,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1425;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;n&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
