The imagery of planting and taking root is common in Scripture, symbolizing stability and growth (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). It suggests that God has given the people a firm foundation, much like a gardener who plants and nurtures a tree. Historically, this can be seen in how God brought the Israelites into the Promised Land, establishing them as a nation. Theologically, it underscores God's providence and care, even when the people are unfaithful.<p><b>They have grown and produced fruit.</b><br>Here, the growth and fruitfulness symbolize the prosperity and success that the people of Judah experienced. In biblical terms, fruitfulness often represents the outcomes of one's actions or spiritual state (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). Despite their spiritual waywardness, the people have experienced material and societal growth. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to bless His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>), yet it also sets the stage for a critique of their spiritual condition.<p><b>You are ever on their lips, but far from their hearts.</b><br>This phrase highlights the hypocrisy of the people, who speak of God but do not truly honor Him in their hearts. It echoes the prophetic critique found in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God condemns those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. This disconnect between outward expression and inward reality is a recurring theme in the prophets and is a call to genuine repentance and faithfulness. It also foreshadows Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He emphasizes the importance of the heart in true worship (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>). The phrase serves as a warning against superficial religiosity and calls for a heartfelt relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Even the wicked owe their existence and opportunities to the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>, &#8220;He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good&#8221;).<p>- The prophet is not accusing God of wrongdoing; he is wrestling with the mystery that the Creator sometimes lets those who oppose Him flourish. <a href="/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a> notes the same tension: &#8220;When the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, it is only to be destroyed forever&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they have taken root</b><p>- &#8220;Taken root&#8221; pictures stability and permanence. The ungodly seem entrenched, their influence hard to uproot.<p>- Job voices a similar complaint: &#8220;Why do the wicked live on, grow old, and become mighty in power?&#8221; (<a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7</a>). Their houses appear &#8220;safe from fear&#8221; (<a href="/job/21-9.htm">Job 21:9</a>).<p>- For Jeremiah, this rooting feels upside-down because elsewhere God promises such security to the righteous (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>). When evil enjoys the blessing reserved for faithfulness, the prophet&#8217;s sense of justice is jarred.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have grown and produced fruit</b><p>- Outward success follows: fields thrive, businesses boom, families multiply. To human eyes, their &#8220;fruit&#8221; looks indistinguishable from the covenant blessings spoken over Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4-6</a>).<p>- Asaph wrestles with the same spectacle: &#8220;See how many are their sins! They have no struggles&#8230; this is what the wicked are like&#8212;always carefree, they increase in wealth&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>).<p>- Yet Scripture warns that such fruit can be deceptive. Jesus&#8217; parable of the rich fool ends with sudden judgment precisely when tangible fruit reached its peak (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are ever on their lips</b><p>- The prosperous speak God-talk fluently. They recite prayers, attend temple, sprinkle pious phrases into conversation.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a> rings loudly: &#8220;&#8216;These people draw near Me with their mouth and honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me&#8217;&#8221;. Jesus repeats the charge in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>.<p>- Lip service can mask empty hearts; it can also ease a guilty conscience and impress onlookers, creating the fa&#231;ade of devotion while reinforcing social standing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but far from their hearts</b><p>- The heart&#8212;seat of will, affection, and loyalty&#8212;remains untouched. <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a> tells us, &#8220;Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life&#8221;. These people have not guarded but hardened theirs.<p>- <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a> sums them up: &#8220;They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him&#8221;.<p>- God sees beneath words to motive and intent (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). What appears fruitful and rooted will eventually be exposed as fruitless and shallow (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/12-2.htm">Jeremiah 12:2</a> captures the prophet&#8217;s perplexity: God, You have allowed the ungodly to thrive, take root, and bear visible fruit, even while they cloak themselves in religious language that never reaches the core of their being. The verse reminds us that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience and sovereignty permit temporary prosperity for the wicked.<p>&#8226; Outward stability and success are not proofs of divine approval.<p>&#8226; Lip service to God without heart allegiance is hypocrisy He will ultimately judge.<p>The passage invites every reader to measure life not by visible fruit alone but by a heart wholly surrendered to the Lord who sees and weighs all things.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Thou hast planted them.</span>--The words express, of course, the questioning distrust of the prophet.
