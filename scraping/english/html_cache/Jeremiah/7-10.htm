They engage in sinful behavior and then come to the temple, believing that their presence there absolves them of wrongdoing. The temple, located in Jerusalem, was the central place of worship and sacrifice, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This reflects a misunderstanding of the temple's purpose, which was not merely a ritualistic place but a symbol of a covenant relationship with God. The act of standing before God in the temple was meant to be an act of reverence and repentance, not a superficial ritual.<p><b>which bears My Name,</b><br>The temple bearing God's Name signifies His ownership and presence. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a name represented character and authority. The temple was not just a building; it was a place where God's glory dwelled. This phrase underscores the seriousness of defiling a place that is consecrated to God. The misuse of the temple for false security is a direct affront to God's holiness and His covenant with Israel.<p><b>and say, &#8216;We are delivered,</b><br>The people falsely claim deliverance, believing that their mere association with the temple guarantees their safety and favor with God. This reflects a misunderstanding of God's covenant, which required obedience and faithfulness, not just ritualistic observance. The false assurance of deliverance without true repentance is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God warns against complacency and presumption.<p><b>so we can continue with all these abominations&#8217;?</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to the idolatrous and immoral practices that the people engaged in, which were detestable to God. This phrase highlights the people's blatant disregard for God's commandments, as they believe they can continue in sin without consequence. The prophets frequently condemned such behavior, emphasizing that true worship of God requires a heart turned away from sin. This reflects the broader biblical theme that genuine faith is evidenced by obedience and transformation, not just external rituals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The people tried to combine the worship of Baal and Jehovah, and passed from the one temple to the other. They went away from the fast or feast in the house of the Lord with the feeling that they were "saved," or "delivered." They had gone through their religious duties, and might claim their reward.

Such a view, moreover, greatly weakens the force of the emphatic "We have escaped." "In order to do," etc., are the words of the prophet, who thus lays bare the secret intentions of these formal worshippers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and then come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
