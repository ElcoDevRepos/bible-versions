In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>, the "sword" symbolizes warfare and destruction, likely at the hands of the Babylonians. Historically, this reflects the consequences of disobedience to God's commands, as the people of Judah sought refuge in Egypt against divine instruction (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19-22</a>). The sword is a common biblical metaphor for divine judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>).<p><b>will return from Egypt to Judah,</b><br>The return from Egypt signifies a reversal of the people's disobedience. Egypt, often a symbol of bondage and reliance on human strength rather than God, was where the remnant fled after the fall of Jerusalem. This return is a physical and spiritual journey back to the land God promised them, echoing the Exodus narrative where God delivered His people from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-42</a>).<p><b>few in number,</b><br>This phrase highlights the severity of the judgment and the small number of survivors. It underscores the consequences of disobedience and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings. The remnant theology is significant in the Bible, where God preserves a small group to continue His covenant promises (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>).<p><b>and the whole remnant of Judah who went to dwell in the land of Egypt</b><br>This refers to those who fled to Egypt after the Babylonian conquest of Judah. Despite warnings from Jeremiah, they sought safety in Egypt, which was contrary to God's command. This act of defiance is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where reliance on foreign powers instead of God leads to downfall (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><b>will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and reliability of God's word over human plans. It is a challenge to the people who doubted Jeremiah's prophecies. The fulfillment of God's word serves as a testament to His sovereignty and faithfulness. This echoes the broader biblical theme that God's purposes prevail over human intentions (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_judah.htm">Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The small group of Israelites who survived the Babylonian conquest and fled to Egypt against God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A place of refuge for the remnant of Judah, symbolizing disobedience and lack of trust in God's protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced destruction due to its people's persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>Represents the judgment and destruction that God allowed to come upon His people due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite human disobedience, God's word and promises remain unshaken.

The &#8220;sword&#8221; refers to the Babylonian invasion that would pursue Judah&#8217;s refugees even in Egypt (<a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10-11</a>; 42:15-17). Only a handful would slip through that judgment.<p>&#8226; God had warned that disobedience would invite the sword (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-10.htm">Jeremiah 24:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that survival is solely by the Lord&#8217;s mercy, never by human schemes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will return from Egypt to Judah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;will return from Egypt to Judah&#8230;&#8221; shows that God&#8217;s plan for His people remained tied to the land He promised them (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-6.htm">Jeremiah 24:6-7</a>; 46:27).<p>&#8226; Egypt, the place of former bondage, had seemed like a safe haven, yet only repentance and a turning back to God&#8217;s appointed place could restore the fugitives.<p>&#8226; The return is both geographic and spiritual: back to the covenant land, back under God&#8217;s direct rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Few in number</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;few in number&#8230;&#8221; heightens the seriousness of the rebellion.

Such defiance set them against God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs!</b><p>This climactic statement makes the contest unmistakable.
