His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from Babylon. The covenant mentioned here refers to a specific agreement made to release Hebrew slaves, in accordance with the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>). This act of proclaiming liberty was likely an attempt to gain divine favor during a time of crisis, as the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem. The concept of liberty here is deeply rooted in the Year of Jubilee, a time when debts were forgiven, and slaves were freed (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). This act was meant to reflect God's justice and mercy, reminding the people of their own deliverance from Egypt.<p><b>the word came to Jeremiah from the LORD</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," was called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to Judah. The phrase "the word came to Jeremiah from the LORD" signifies divine revelation, a common occurrence in the prophetic books. This underscores the authority and authenticity of Jeremiah's message. The prophets often served as intermediaries between God and His people, delivering messages that called for repentance and obedience. In this context, the word from the LORD would address the sincerity and faithfulness of the covenant made by Zedekiah and the people. This phrase also highlights the ongoing communication between God and His chosen messengers, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.

The law of Moses did not allow in the case of a free-born Hebrew more than a temporary bondage of seven years (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm" title="If you buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>), extended (but under the form of serfage rather than slavery) in the later regulations of <a href="/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39-40</a> to the time that might intervene between the date of purchase and the commencement of the next year of jubilee. In <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a> we have an instance of the working of the law, as bringing even the sons of a prophet into this modified slavery. Only if the man preferred his state as a slave to the risks of freedom could his master retain him after the appointed limit (<a href="/context/exodus/21-5.htm" title="And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:">Exodus 21:5-6</a>). The law had apparently fallen into disuse, and the nobles of Judah, like those of Athens before Solon, and Rome before the institution of the Tribunate, had used the law of debt to bring a large number of their fellow citizens into slavery, just as their successors did after the return from Babylon (<a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>). Under the pressure of the danger from the Chaldaean invasion, and that he might have the ready service of freemen instead of the forced work of slaves, perhaps also in consequence of the revival of the law, that followed on its discovery, probably in the form of the Book of Deuteronomy, in the days of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8</a>), Zedekiah had been led to promise freedom to all the slave population of this class that were within the walls of Jerusalem, either as a celebration of a Sabbatic year, or jubilee, or, irrespective of any such observance, as a reparation for past neglect. The step was probably not without its influence in giving fresh energy to the defenders of the city. The Chaldaeans, threatened by the approach of an Egyptian army (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm" title="Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.">Jeremiah 37:5</a>), raised the siege (<a href="/jeremiah/34-21.htm" title="And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.">Jeremiah 34:21</a>). When the danger was past, however, the princes who had agreed to the emancipation returned to their old policy of oppression (<a href="/jeremiah/34-11.htm" title="But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.">Jeremiah 34:11</a>), and those who had been liberated were brought under a bondage all the more bitter for the temporary taste of freedom. Against this perfidious tyranny the prophet, stirred by "the word of the Lord," bears his protests. His sympathies, like those of true prophets at all times, were with the poor and the oppressed. The phrase "proclaim liberty" was closely connected with the year of jubilee, as in <a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm" title="And you shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee to you; and you shall return every man to his possession, and you shall return every man to his family.">Leviticus 25:10</a>, <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A covenant.</span> The scene of this "covenant" was the temple (veto. 15, 18).
