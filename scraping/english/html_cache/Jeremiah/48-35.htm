The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, which is significant in understanding their complex relationship with Israel. The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and certainty of the prophecy, indicating that the message is directly from God. This divine declaration underscores the seriousness of the judgment pronounced against Moab.<p><b>I will bring an end to those who make offerings on the high places</b><br>High places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with pagan rituals. In ancient Near Eastern culture, these sites were considered closer to the gods and were used for sacrifices and offerings. The practice of worshiping on high places was condemned in Israelite religion, as it often involved idolatry and syncretism. The ending of these practices in Moab signifies God's judgment against idolatry and false worship, aligning with similar judgments against Israel and Judah for their own use of high places (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>).<p><b>and burn incense to their gods.</b><br>Burning incense was a common religious practice in the ancient world, symbolizing prayers and offerings to deities. In Moab, this practice was directed towards their gods, which were often in opposition to the worship of Yahweh. The condemnation of incense burning highlights the exclusivity of worship that God demands, as seen in the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s judgment against idolatry, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel. The cessation of incense burning signifies the end of Moab's idolatrous practices and the assertion of God's sovereignty over all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
