The "families of the north" refers to the Babylonian empire and its allies, who were located to the north of Judah. This summoning is a divine act, emphasizing that God uses nations to fulfill His purposes, even when they are unaware of it. The north often symbolizes danger and judgment in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>, where disaster is prophesied to come from the north.<p><b>and I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Referring to Nebuchadnezzar as "My servant" highlights God's authority over even the most powerful earthly rulers. Although Nebuchadnezzar was a pagan king, God used him to execute judgment on Judah for their disobedience. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, where God calls Cyrus His shepherd, showing that God can use any leader to accomplish His divine will.<p><b>whom I will bring against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations</b><br>The "land" refers to Judah, and "its residents" are the people of Jerusalem and the surrounding areas. The inclusion of "all the surrounding nations" indicates that God's judgment through Babylon would extend beyond Judah, affecting neighboring nations like Edom, Moab, and Ammon. This widespread judgment is a fulfillment of God's warnings through the prophets, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15-16</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6-7</a>.<p><b>So I will devote them to destruction and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation</b><br>The phrase "devote them to destruction" is reminiscent of the Hebrew concept of "herem," where something is set apart for complete destruction as an offering to God. This severe judgment reflects the seriousness of Judah's sin and rebellion. The resulting "object of horror and contempt" signifies the shame and disgrace that would follow, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>. The term "everlasting desolation" underscores the long-lasting impact of this judgment, though it is important to note that "everlasting" in biblical terms can sometimes mean a long period rather than eternity, as seen in the eventual return from exile and restoration of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is sovereign over all nations and history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, referred to as God's "servant" in this context, used by God to execute judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire in the ancient Near East, used by God as an instrument of judgment against Judah and surrounding nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_surrounding_nations.htm">Judah and Surrounding Nations</a></b><br>The primary recipients of God's judgment due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and uses them to accomplish His purposes, even when they are unaware of it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecy serves as both a warning and a call to repentance.

It has its parallel, and, in fact, its explanation, in the language in which Isaiah speaks of Cyrus as the shepherd, the anointed, of Jehovah. (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>) Each ruler of the great empires of the world was, in ways he knew not, working out the purposes of God. The phrase "I will utterly destroy" may be noted as specially characteristic of Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-34.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:">Deuteronomy 2:34</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-6.htm" title="And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.">Deuteronomy 3:6</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm" title="For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-21.htm" title="And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="/joshua/8-26.htm" title="For Joshua drew not his hand back, with which he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.">Joshua 8:26</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The families of the north</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant.</span> This is the rendering of the Targum, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, and corresponds with the reading of a few extant manuscripts. The received text, however, reads, "and unto Nebuchadnezzar," etc. Neither reading is satisfactory. The latter one is intolerably harsh; the former makes Nebuchadnezzar a mere adjunct of the tribes of the north. In the other passages, moreover, where this king is solemnly entitled "my servant," the clause is the most prominent one in the sentence (see <a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>). The words in question have a sort of family resemblance to the glosses which meet us occasionally both in the form of the Hebrew text represented by the Massoretic recension, and those by the principal ancient versions. The words are omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">My servant</span>. Generally to be a "servant" of Jehovah or of any supposed deity is to be a worshipper. Thus Daniel is called by Darius, "servant of the living God" (<a href="/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>), and thus Abdallah, "servant of Allah," has become a favorite surname of the followers of Mohammed. In the Book of Jeremiah itself (<a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>), and in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), "my servant" is the form in which Jehovah addresses his chosen people; and in the second part of Isaiah the suffering Messiah is so styled. Here, however, a foreign king is thus entitled. How is this to be explained? Cyrus, no doubt, in <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, 45:1, is called "my shepherd" and "my anointed one;" but then Cyrus, in the view of the prophet, was a genuine though unconscious worshipper of the true God (<a href="/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>), whereas Nebuchadnezzar was known to be a polytheist and an idolater. We must, therefore, take "servant" to be applied to Nebuchadnezzar in a lower sense than to the other bearers of the title. The Hebrew 'ebbed, in fact, may be either "slave" in something approaching to the terrible modern sense, or in the sense in which Eliezer was one (i.e. little less than a son, and a possible heir, <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>), and which is still in full force in Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">An astonishment</span> (see on Jeremiah 2:11). <span class="cmt_word">An hissing</span> (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>;
