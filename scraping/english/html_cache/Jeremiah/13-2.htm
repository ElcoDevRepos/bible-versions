Jeremiah's purchase of the loincloth signifies obedience to God's command, reflecting the intimate relationship between God and His people. The act of buying the loincloth is a prophetic symbol of Israel's initial closeness to God, akin to a garment closely worn by the body. This imagery is used to illustrate Israel's intended role as a people set apart for God, much like a priestly garment.<p><b>in accordance with the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Jeremiah's role as a prophet who acts in direct obedience to divine instruction. The phrase underscores the authority of God's word and the importance of following His commands precisely. It highlights the theme of prophetic obedience found throughout the Bible, where God's messengers are called to act out His messages as a form of living parable. This obedience is a model for believers, demonstrating the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will.<p><b>and I put it around my waist</b><br>The act of wearing the loincloth around the waist symbolizes the closeness and binding relationship between God and His people. In biblical symbolism, the waist is often associated with strength and readiness for action, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are instructed to gird their loins with truth. This act by Jeremiah serves as a visual representation of how Israel was meant to be bound to God, serving as His witness to the nations. The imagery also foreshadows the eventual separation due to Israel's unfaithfulness, as later described in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Peter applies the same imagery to mental alertness: &#8220;Therefore gird up the loins of your mind&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s act also anticipates the future judgment signified when the belt is later ruined, showing how pride would destroy Judah&#8217;s intended closeness to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226;
