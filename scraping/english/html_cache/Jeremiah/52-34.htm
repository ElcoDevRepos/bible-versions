After being imprisoned for 37 years, Jehoiachin was released and given a daily allowance. This act of kindness is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern practices, where conquered kings were often treated harshly. The provision of a daily portion signifies a level of respect and care, possibly indicating a political strategy to maintain stability among the exiled Judean population. This event is also recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27-30</a>, emphasizing its importance in the biblical narrative.<p><b>for the rest of his life</b><br>The phrase underscores the permanence of the provision. Jehoiachin's sustenance was guaranteed for his lifetime, reflecting a covenant-like assurance. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve a remnant of David's line, despite the exile. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant with David, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God promises that David's house and kingdom will endure forever.<p><b>until the day of his death</b><br>This final phrase indicates the completeness of the provision. Jehoiachin's needs were met until his death, symbolizing a form of restoration and hope for the exiled community. It also foreshadows the eventual return from exile and the restoration of Judah. Theologically, it points to the enduring nature of God's promises, even in times of judgment and exile. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for His people eternally, as reflected in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the bread of life, promising sustenance to those who come to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The former king of Judah who was taken captive by the Babylonians.

Jesus later teaches us to pray, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>), underscoring God&#8217;s concern for everyday needs. <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a> celebrates new mercies every morning; this daily ration embodies that truth.<p>Consider:<p>- Faith flourishes when we count God&#8217;s recurring mercies, not just the dramatic ones.<p>- Regular provisions testify that God&#8217;s care is practical as well as spiritual (<a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the rest of his life</b><p>This phrase stretches the promise across decades, not days. <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a> declares, &#8220;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,&#8221; and God sees to it here. <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> assures believers that the One who begins a good work will carry it on to completion.
