Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a response to Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>). The term "fierce" underscores the seriousness of divine judgment, reflecting God's holiness and justice. This anger is not arbitrary but is a righteous response to the people's persistent rebellion.<p><b>will not turn back</b><br>This indicates the certainty and inevitability of God's judgment. Once God has decreed judgment, it will not be revoked until its purpose is fulfilled. This reflects the unchangeable nature of God's decrees (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The idea of God not turning back is also seen in the context of His promises and blessings, showing His faithfulness and consistency.<p><b>until He has fully accomplished</b><br>God's actions are purposeful and deliberate. This phrase suggests that His judgments are not random but are intended to achieve a specific outcome. The fulfillment of God's purposes often involves both judgment and restoration, as seen in the broader context of Jeremiah, where judgment leads to eventual renewal and hope for Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>the purposes of His heart</b><br>This highlights that God's actions are rooted in His divine will and character. The "heart" of God refers to His innermost intentions and desires, which are ultimately for the good of His people and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. This aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares His plans will stand.<p><b>In the days to come</b><br>This phrase points to a future time when the fulfillment of God's purposes will be evident. It suggests a prophetic outlook, where current events are part of a larger divine plan that will be understood more fully in the future. This is consistent with the prophetic literature, which often speaks of a "day of the LORD" or a future time of reckoning and restoration (<a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>).<p><b>you will understand this</b><br>The promise of understanding indicates that the people will eventually recognize the reasons behind God's actions. This understanding is often linked to repentance and a renewed relationship with God. It suggests a future revelation or insight that will bring clarity to God's dealings with His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/12-10.htm">Daniel 12:10</a>, where understanding is promised to the wise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of both judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Israel during a time of great turmoil and impending exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.
