It suggests that God's knowledge and plans for individuals exist even before their physical formation. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, where David speaks of God's intimate involvement in his creation. The idea of God forming individuals in the womb underscores the belief in the sanctity of life and God's intentional design for each person.<p><b>I knew you</b><br>The term "knew" implies a deep, personal relationship and foreknowledge. In biblical terms, "knowing" often signifies an intimate, covenantal relationship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4.htm">Genesis 4:1</a> with Adam and Eve. This suggests that God has a specific purpose and plan for Jeremiah, which is part of His divine will. It reflects the theological concept of God's election and foreordination.<p><b>and before you were born I set you apart</b><br>"Set apart" indicates consecration for a holy purpose. This reflects the biblical theme of sanctification, where individuals or objects are dedicated to God's service. Jeremiah's calling echoes the separateness of Israel as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). It also prefigures the New Testament concept of believers being set apart for God's purposes (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and appointed you as a prophet to the nations</b><br>Jeremiah's appointment as a prophet highlights his role as God's spokesperson. Unlike other prophets who primarily addressed Israel or Judah, Jeremiah's mission included the nations, indicating a broader scope of influence. This foreshadows the New Testament mission to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Prophets often served as types of Christ, who is the ultimate Prophet, Priest, and King. Jeremiah's life and ministry, marked by suffering and perseverance, can be seen as a precursor to Christ's own prophetic ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Long before Jeremiah took his first breath, God was already in relationship with him&#8212;an idea reinforced by <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a> (&#8220;those God foreknew He also predestined,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This foreknowledge assures us that God&#8217;s plans are personal: <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a> declares, &#8220;For I know the plans I have for you&#8230; plans for welfare and not for calamity&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Believers today stand in that same personal knowledge (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>), resting in the security that God&#8217;s love precedes our existence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before you were born I set you apart</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Set apart&#8221; means consecrated, dedicated wholly to God&#8217;s purpose.

From the womb to a worldwide mission, Jeremiah&#8217;s life was shaped by divine intention. The verse affirms the sanctity of life, the security of God&#8217;s foreknowledge, the call to holiness, and the certainty that God empowers His servants to speak truth to the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">I knew thee.</span>--With the force which the word often has in Hebrew, as implying. not foreknowledge only, but choice and approval (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-18.htm" title="The LORD knows the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.">Psalm 37:18</a>, <a href="/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">I sanctified thee.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., consecrated thee, set thee apart as hallowed for this special use.</span><p><span class= "bld">Ordained.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">I have appointed, </span>without the conjunction, this verb referring <span class= "bld">to </span>the manifestation in time of the eternal purpose.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the nations.</span>--i.e., <span class= "ital">to the outlying Gentile nations. </span>This was the distinguishing characteristic of Jeremiah's work. Other prophets were sent to Israel and Judah, with occasional parentheses of prophecies that affected the Gentiles. The horizon of Jeremiah was to extend more widely. In part his work was to make them drink of the cup of the Lord's fury (<a href="/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>); but in part also he was a witness to them of a brighter future (<a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm" title="But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:39</a>). It is as though he had drunk in the Spirit of Isaiah, and thought of the true prophet as one who was to be a light of the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knew thee;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. took notice of thee; virtually equivalent to selected thee (comp. <a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>; <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). Observe, the predestination of individuals is a familiar idea in the Old Testament (comp. <a href="/isaiah/45-4.htm">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>). It was also familiar to the Assyrians: King Assurba-nipal declares at the opening of his ' Annals ' that the gods "in the body of his mother have made (him) to rule Assyria." Familiar, too, to the great family of religious reformers. For, as Dean Milman has truly observed, "No Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution. He who is destined for such a work must have a full conviction that God is acting directly, immediately, consciously, and therefore with irresistible power, upon him and through him He who is not predestined, who does not declare, who does not believe himself predestined as the author of a great religions movement, he in whom God is not manifestly, sensibly, avowedly working out his pre-established designs, will never be saint or reformer" ('Latin Christianity,' 1:111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctified thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. set thee apart for holy uses. <span class="cmt_word">Ordained</span>; rather, <span class="accented">appointed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the nations</span>. Jeremiah's prophecies, in fact, have reference not only to Israel, but to the peoples in relation to Israel (ver. 10; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15, 16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46-49</a>;
