Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly calls His people to listen and obey (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The phrase "incline their ears" suggests a deliberate act of listening, which the people refused to do. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where prophets like Jeremiah are sent to call the people back to covenant faithfulness. The refusal to listen is not just a physical act but a spiritual rebellion against God's authority.<p><b>but each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart</b><br>The "stubbornness of his evil heart" indicates a deep-seated rebellion and moral corruption. In biblical anthropology, the heart is the center of will and decision-making (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> describes the heart as deceitful and desperately wicked, emphasizing humanity's need for divine intervention. This phrase underscores the individual responsibility of each person in their rebellion, as each one chose to follow their own desires rather than God's commands. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of human sinfulness and the need for a new heart, as promised in the New Covenant (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>).<p><b>So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant</b><br>This refers to the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> and <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, which were consequences for disobedience to the Mosaic Covenant. These curses included military defeat, famine, and exile, all of which Judah experienced. The historical context is the Babylonian exile, a direct result of the nation's failure to uphold the covenant. This phrase emphasizes God's justice and faithfulness to His word, as He warned the people of the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>I had commanded them to follow but they did not keep</b><br>The commandments refer to the laws given through Moses, which were meant to set Israel apart as God's holy people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The failure to keep these commandments is a central theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting the need for a savior who would perfectly fulfill the law. This points forward to Jesus Christ, who stated that He came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The inability of the people to keep the covenant underscores the necessity of the New Covenant, where the law would be written on their hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
