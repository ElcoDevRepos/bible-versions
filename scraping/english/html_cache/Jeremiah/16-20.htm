In the ancient Near Eastern context, people often crafted idols from wood, stone, or metal, believing these objects could embody divine power. The question underscores the absurdity of humans creating their own deities, as true divinity cannot be manufactured. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the idea of worshipping something made by human hands. The question also highlights the distinction between the Creator and the created, emphasizing that only the one true God is worthy of worship.<p><b>Such are not gods!&#8221;</b><br>This statement affirms the impotence and falseness of idols. Despite being revered by many cultures, these man-made objects lack the power, presence, and attributes of the living God. The declaration aligns with <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describes idols as having mouths but not speaking, eyes but not seeing. It also points to the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, which prohibits the worship of other gods. Theologically, this phrase reinforces the monotheistic belief central to the faith, asserting that only Yahweh is the true God. This also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of deity (<a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>), contrasting with the lifelessness of idols.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
