In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet often expresses sorrow over the impending judgment on Judah due to their idolatry and disobedience. The "brokenness" can be seen as both personal and national, symbolizing the spiritual and moral decay of the people. This lament echoes the broader biblical theme of mourning over sin and its consequences, similar to the laments found in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a>).<p><b>my wound is grievous!</b><br>The imagery of a grievous wound suggests severe and incurable pain, often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. In Jeremiah's context, it signifies the deep spiritual and physical affliction that Judah faces due to their covenant unfaithfulness. This can be compared to the wounds described in <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5-6</a>, where the nation is depicted as being sick from head to toe due to their sins.<p><b>But I said, &#8220;This is truly my sickness,</b><br>Here, the acknowledgment of "my sickness" indicates a personal acceptance of the condition. It reflects a recognition of the inevitability of suffering due to sin, aligning with the biblical principle of personal responsibility for one's actions. This acceptance is reminiscent of the confessions found in Lamentations, where the people acknowledge their sins and the resulting judgment (<a href="/lamentations/3-39.htm">Lamentations 3:39-42</a>).<p><b>and I must bear it.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "I must bear it" signifies a resigned acceptance of the consequences. This reflects the biblical theme of enduring suffering with patience and faith, as seen in the lives of other prophets and figures like Job, who bore his afflictions while maintaining his faith in God (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>). It also points to the New Testament teaching of bearing one's cross, as Jesus instructed His followers to do (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>), highlighting the call to endure trials as part of the Christian journey.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is lamenting the state of Judah and expressing personal and communal suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment and exile due to their idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The event that Jeremiah is prophesying about, where the people of Judah will be taken captive by Babylon as a consequence of their sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_suffering.htm">Acknowledgment of Suffering</a></b><br>Recognize that suffering is a part of the human experience and can be a result of personal or communal sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>Accepting one's own role in suffering, as Jeremiah acknowledges his "sickness" and the need to bear it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even in suffering, trust that God is in control and has a purpose for allowing trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Use times of suffering as opportunities for repentance and seeking restoration with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Hope in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Remember that God promises deliverance and healing, even if it is not immediate.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_10_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 10:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_10_19_God_s_role_in_suffering.htm">How does Jeremiah 10:19 illustrate God's sovereignty in our personal suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jeremiah_s_wound_response.htm">What lessons can we learn from Jeremiah's response to his "wound" in 10:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_10_19_Trust_God_in_hardships.htm">How can Jeremiah 10:19 encourage us to trust God during life's hardships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jer_10_19_Rom_8_28_on_suffering.htm">Connect Jeremiah 10:19 with Romans 8:28 on God's purpose in suffering.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jeremiah_s_suffering_to_daily_life.htm">How can we apply Jeremiah's acceptance of suffering to our daily challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Jeremiah_10_19.htm">What is the historical context of Jeremiah 10:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_10_19_God_s_judgment_on_Israel.htm">How does Jeremiah 10:19 reflect God's judgment on Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Woe_to_me_in_Jeremiah_10_19.htm">What does "Woe to me because of my injury" signify in Jeremiah 10:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_stance_on_overthinking.htm">What defines spiritual sickness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_god_permit_divorce_despite_hating_it.htm">Does God allow divorce despite hating it?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_jer._35_19_conflict_with_covenant_breaks.htm">Jeremiah 35:19 - Does the promise of perpetual blessings for the Rechabites conflict with other scriptures that suggest Israel's covenants can be broken?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what's_the_gospel_of_the_kingdom.htm">What is the Gospel of the Kingdom about?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Jeremiah 10:19 Mean</div><b>Woe to me because of my brokenness</b><p>Jeremiah voices a heartfelt lament.

The prophet&#8217;s &#8220;woe&#8221; is both confession and acknowledgment that the devastation facing Judah is deserved (<a href="/jeremiah/9-1.htm">Jeremiah 9:1-2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-11.htm">Lamentations 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My wound is grievous</b><p>The &#8220;wound&#8221; is beyond human remedy. <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a> uses the same imagery: &#8220;Why is my pain unending and my wound incurable?&#8221; This parallels <a href="/micah/1-9.htm">Micah 1:9</a>, &#8220;Her wound is incurable; it has reached Judah.&#8221; Such language reflects true covenant consequences spelled out in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59-61</a>. The prophet does not downplay sin&#8217;s damage; he names it as grievous, affirming that divine justice is never superficial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is truly my sickness</b><p>Jeremiah owns the calamity: no excuses, no blame-shifting. <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> says, &#8220;We all like sheep have gone astray,&#8221; while <a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a> calls Israel to return because &#8220;your iniquity has been your downfall.&#8221; By calling the catastrophe &#8220;my sickness,&#8221; Jeremiah recognizes that rebellion against God is a spiritual disease (<a href="/psalms/38-3.htm">Psalm 38:3-4</a>). <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a> later confirms that all have the same sickness&#8212;sin&#8212;which only God can cure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I must bear it</b><p>Accepting responsibility, Jeremiah echoes the principle of <a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>: &#8220;He is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.&#8221; <a href="/lamentations/3-27.htm">Lamentations 3:27-28</a> commends bearing the yoke in youth, sitting alone in silence when the Lord lays it on. First Peter 2:19-20 urges believers to endure suffering when conscious of God. Jeremiah is not resigning to despair; he submits to God&#8217;s righteous discipline, trusting that divine chastening aims at restoration (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a> captures a faithful servant&#8217;s response to deserved judgment: honest lament, clear recognition of sin&#8217;s grievous wound, personal ownership of the nation&#8217;s sickness, and humble willingness to bear God-ordained consequences. These lines invite every believer to face sin&#8217;s reality, accept divine discipline, and look to the Lord who alone heals broken people (<a href="/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Woe is me . . .</span>--From this verse to the end of the chapter we have, with the prophet's characteristic dramatic vividness, the lamentation of the daughter of Israel in her captivity, bewailing the transgressions that had led to it.
