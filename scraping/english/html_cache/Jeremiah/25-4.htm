The prophets, such as Isaiah, Hosea, and Amos, were sent repeatedly to warn Israel and Judah of impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry. This reflects God's patience and desire for repentance, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>, where God continually sent messengers because He had compassion on His people. The phrase "again and again" underscores the relentless nature of God's outreach, highlighting His mercy and long-suffering nature.<p><b>but you have not listened</b><br>This part of the verse points to the people's stubbornness and refusal to heed God's warnings. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel's history is marked by cycles of rebellion and repentance. Despite the clear messages from the prophets, the people often chose to ignore them, leading to consequences such as exile. This refusal to listen is a recurring theme, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people's hearts are described as calloused, preventing them from understanding and turning back to God.<p><b>or inclined your ear to hear</b><br>The imagery of inclining one's ear suggests an active effort to understand and obey. In the ancient Near Eastern context, listening was not merely about hearing words but involved a response and obedience. The failure to incline their ear indicates a deliberate choice to reject God's message. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, where inclining one's ear to wisdom is associated with seeking understanding. The lack of response from the people contrasts with the ideal of a faithful servant who listens and acts upon God's word, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the role of the obedient servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and warnings through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>God's messengers, sent repeatedly to deliver His word and call the people to repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The primary prophet in this context, delivering God's message of impending judgment due to the people's disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, representing the southern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The impending event of judgment that Jeremiah warns about, where the people of Judah will be taken captive by Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_persistence_of_god's_call.htm">The Persistence of God's Call</a></b><br>God is patient and persistent, sending His prophets repeatedly to call His people back to Him.
