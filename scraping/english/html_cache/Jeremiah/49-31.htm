The context is a prophecy against the nations surrounding Israel, specifically targeting those who have become self-satisfied and unprepared for conflict. Historically, this reflects the period when various nations, including those in the Arabian Peninsula, were at peace and felt secure in their isolation. The call to "rise up" suggests a sudden and decisive movement, often seen in biblical narratives where God uses nations as instruments of His judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>).<p><b>one that dwells securely,&#8221; declares the LORD.</b><br>The security mentioned here is deceptive, as it is not founded on divine protection but on human confidence. This reflects a common biblical theme where nations or individuals trust in their own strength or circumstances rather than in God (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and certainty of the prophecy, underscoring that it is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree.<p><b>They have no gates or bars;</b><br>This imagery suggests a lack of fortifications, indicating vulnerability. In ancient times, city gates and bars were crucial for defense against invaders. The absence of these defenses implies a false sense of security and an underestimation of potential threats. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual complacency, where individuals or nations neglect the need for spiritual vigilance and protection (e.g., <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>).<p><b>they live alone.</b><br>Living "alone" suggests isolation, both geographically and politically. This could refer to nomadic tribes or small city-states that were not part of larger alliances or empires. In a spiritual sense, it can also imply a lack of community or support, highlighting the dangers of isolation from God and His people. This phrase may also connect to the idea of being set apart, but in this context, it is a negative separation, leading to vulnerability rather than holiness (e.g., <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, where God notes it is not good for man to be alone).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon nations, including Israel and its neighbors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedar.htm">Kedar</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, often associated with the Arabian desert.

Like Israel in the prophetic vision (<a href="/numbers/23-9.htm">Numbers 23:9</a>), "they dwell alone." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rise up,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#363;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">advance</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a nation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1471.htm">Strong's 1471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foreign nation, a Gentile, a troop of animals, a flight of locusts</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at ease,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1435;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#234;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7961.htm">Strong's 7961: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tranquil, careless, security</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one that dwells</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">securely,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1462;&#1430;&#1496;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7687;e&#183;&#7789;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
