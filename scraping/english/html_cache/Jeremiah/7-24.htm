Throughout the Old Testament, God repeatedly called His people to listen to His commandments and follow His ways (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The act of inclining the ear is a metaphor for being attentive and obedient. The Israelites' failure to listen is a recurring theme, as seen in the warnings of the prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>). This disobedience is not just a failure to hear but a willful rejection of God's guidance.<p><b>but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts</b><br>The "stubborn inclinations" refer to the Israelites' persistent rebellion against God. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of will and decision-making. Jeremiah often speaks of the deceitfulness and wickedness of the human heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). This phrase underscores the inherent sinfulness and tendency of humanity to choose its own path over God's. The stubbornness is akin to the hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Exodus, illustrating a deliberate choice to resist God's will.<p><b>They went backward and not forward</b><br>This imagery of moving backward rather than forward signifies regression in spiritual and moral terms. Instead of progressing in their relationship with God and growing in righteousness, the Israelites were reverting to their sinful ways. This backward movement is symbolic of a return to idolatry and disobedience, reminiscent of the Israelites' frequent lapses into idol worship (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The call to move forward is a call to spiritual growth and maturity, as seen in the New Testament exhortations to press on toward the goal (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>). This regression is a stark contrast to the forward movement God desires for His people, which is ultimately fulfilled in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who leads believers into a new covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
