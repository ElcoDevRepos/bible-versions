This act by Jeremiah was significant because it demonstrated his faith in God's promise of restoration despite the impending Babylonian exile. The sealing of the deed ensured its authenticity and protection, symbolizing the certainty of God's covenant promises. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who guarantees the New Covenant through His blood, sealing believers with the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>).<p><b>called in witnesses</b><br>The presence of witnesses was crucial in ancient legal transactions to verify the legitimacy of the agreement. This practice is consistent with the Mosaic Law, which required witnesses to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Jeremiah's inclusion of witnesses underscores the public and undeniable nature of the transaction, reflecting the transparency and accountability expected in God's community. This mirrors the role of witnesses in the New Testament, where the apostles and early Christians bore witness to the resurrection of Christ (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>and weighed out the silver on the scales</b><br>Weighing silver on scales was a common method of ensuring fair and accurate transactions in the ancient world. This detail highlights the integrity and precision involved in the purchase, reflecting God's justice and righteousness. The use of silver, a valuable commodity, emphasizes the costliness of redemption, paralleling the precious blood of Christ as the price for humanity's salvation (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). The act of weighing also signifies the careful consideration and deliberate action taken by Jeremiah, trusting in God's future restoration of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is instructed by God to buy a field in Anathoth as a sign of hope and future restoration for Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/anathoth.htm">Anathoth</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Benjamin, significant as Jeremiah's hometown and the location of the field he purchases.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals called upon to observe and validate the transaction, ensuring its legality and authenticity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deed.htm">The Deed</a></b><br>A legal document that signifies the purchase of the field, symbolizing God's promise of restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scales.htm">The Scales</a></b><br>Used to weigh the silver, representing fairness and accuracy in the transaction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Jeremiah's purchase of the field is an act of faith, demonstrating trust in God's promises despite current circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_hope.htm">Symbol of Hope</a></b><br>The transaction serves as a tangible sign of hope and future restoration for Israel, reminding believers of God's faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legal_and_spiritual_integrity.htm">Legal and Spiritual Integrity</a></b><br>The detailed process of signing, sealing, and witnessing the deed emphasizes the importance of integrity in both legal and spiritual matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The event underscores God's control over history and His ability to fulfill His promises, encouraging believers to trust in His plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_witness.htm">Community Witness</a></b><br>The involvement of witnesses highlights the role of community in affirming and supporting acts of faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_32_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 32:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_32_10_Follow_God_s_instructions.htm">How does Jeremiah 32:10 illustrate the importance of following God's instructions precisely?

Jeremiah&#8217;s signed name, sealed scroll, gathered witnesses, and weighed silver formed a public, legal act rooting God&#8217;s promise in everyday life. While Jerusalem faced siege, the prophet looked beyond present ruin to future restoration, demonstrating that when God speaks of hope, His people can invest everything&#8212;name, reputation, and resources&#8212;confident that His word never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And I subscribed the evidence . . .</span>--Literally, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">I wrote in the book</span>--the last word being used for any kind of document, as for an indictment in <a href="/job/31-35.htm" title="Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book.">Job 31:35</a>, and here for a deed of conveyance. The minuteness with which the transaction is recorded is every way remarkable, partly as showing that the prophet was careful that no legal formality should be lacking to give validity to the purchase; partly, as the next verse shows, because there was a secret, unattested, unsealed (and in that sense "open") document, which the witnesses did not subscribe, and with the contents of which they were probably not acquainted. The sealed document was one closed up as a safeguard against fraudulent alterations (comp. <a href="/isaiah/29-11.htm" title="And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:">Isaiah 29:11</a>). In the weighing of the money we see an indication of the old practice--probably consequent on the practice of "clipping" coined money--of dealing even with the current coin as if it were bullion, just as bankers weigh a parcel of sovereigns now before giving credit for the amount. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm" title="And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.">Zechariah 11:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - The Authorized Version is here so far wrong, on technical terms, that it seems best to retranslate the whole passage: "And I wrote (the circumstances) in the deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance. And I took the purchase deed, that which was sealed (containing the offer and the conditions), and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah (rather, Makhseiah), in the sight of Hanameel my uncle, and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the purchase deed, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this sealed purchase deed, and this open deed; and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days." The deed was made in two copies, so that if the open one were lost, or suspected of having been tampered with, an appeal might always be made to the sealed copy. The latter was to be placed in an earthen vessel, to preserve it from injury by damp. It ought to be added that the words in ver. 11, rendered "containing the offer and the conditions," are difficult. "Containing" is not expressed in the Hebrew, and "offer" is not the ordinary meaning, though etymologically justifiable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I signed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#7733;&#183;t&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
