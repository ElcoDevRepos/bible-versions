In ancient times, city walls were crucial for defense, symbolizing security and resilience. Jeremiah, as a prophet, faced hostility from his own people, and God&#8217;s assurance here is that he will be as unyielding and protective as a wall. This imagery is reminiscent of God&#8217;s promises to other prophets and leaders, such as Moses and Joshua, where divine support is pledged in the face of adversity.<p><b>a fortified wall of bronze</b><br>Bronze, in biblical times, was a symbol of strength and durability. It was used in the construction of the Tabernacle and Temple, indicating its importance and resilience. By describing Jeremiah as a "fortified wall of bronze," God emphasizes the prophet's invincibility against spiritual and physical attacks. This metaphor also points to the divine empowerment given to Jeremiah, making him unbreakable in his mission, much like the strength attributed to Jesus Christ in His earthly ministry.<p><b>they will fight against you but will not overcome you</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the inevitable opposition Jeremiah will face. Throughout his ministry, Jeremiah encountered resistance from kings, priests, and false prophets. However, the assurance that they "will not overcome you" highlights God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen servants. This echoes the New Testament promise found in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" It reassures believers of divine victory over worldly challenges.<p><b>for I am with you to save and deliver you</b><br>God&#8217;s presence is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing comfort and assurance. Here, the promise to "save and deliver" underscores God&#8217;s active role in Jeremiah&#8217;s life, ensuring his safety and success. This divine companionship is a type of Christ, who promises His presence to His followers in <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, "I am with you always, to the very end of the age." It highlights the personal relationship God maintains with His people, offering salvation and deliverance.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the authority and certainty of the message. It is a divine proclamation, emphasizing that the promise comes directly from God, who is faithful and unchanging. This assurance is foundational for believers, as it reflects the trustworthiness of God&#8217;s word, similar to the declarations made by Jesus in the Gospels, where His words carry divine authority and promise fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
