In the prophetic tradition, such declarations underscore the seriousness and importance of the ensuing instructions. The phrase is a common introduction in prophetic literature, indicating that the prophet is acting as a mouthpiece for God.<p><b>Go and buy a clay jar from a potter:</b><br>The instruction to purchase a clay jar is symbolic. In ancient Israel, pottery was a common household item, and the potter's work was well understood by the people. The clay jar represents the nation of Israel, fragile and shaped by the hands of the potter, who symbolizes God (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>). The act of buying the jar signifies the intentionality and purpose behind the forthcoming prophetic action. This imagery is also a precursor to the breaking of the jar, symbolizing the impending judgment and destruction due to Israel's disobedience.<p><b>Take some of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests:</b><br>The inclusion of elders and priests highlights the communal and religious significance of the message. Elders were respected leaders within the community, and priests were religious authorities. Their presence would lend credibility and gravity to the prophetic act, ensuring that the message reached both the civic and religious spheres of society. This gathering of leaders is reminiscent of other biblical instances where leaders are called to witness significant events or judgments (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/31-28.htm">Deuteronomy 31:28</a>). It underscores the collective responsibility and accountability of the nation's leaders in guiding the people according to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and judgment through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often involving warnings of impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_potter.htm">The Potter</a></b><br>A craftsman who creates clay vessels, symbolizing God's sovereign authority over His creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_the_people.htm">The Elders of the People</a></b><br>Leaders within the community of Judah, representing the collective wisdom and authority of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests.htm">The Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for maintaining the spiritual life of the nation, often involved in temple worship and sacrifices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The imagery of the potter and clay reminds us of God's ultimate authority over creation.

Jeremiah is not offering personal opinion; he is relaying the very speech of God, the Creator whose word never fails (<a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>). By opening with this declaration, the passage:<p>- Reminds hearers that obedience is not optional (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).<p>- Underscores the unchanging reliability of God&#8217;s warnings and promises (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>).<p>- Sets the stage for a vivid object lesson that carries divine weight, not mere symbolism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go and buy a clay jar from a potter</b><p>The Lord instructs Jeremiah to purchase a finished earthenware vessel&#8212;fragile, inexpensive, yet useful. This deliberate act recalls the previous scene in the potter&#8217;s house where the clay was still moldable (<a href="/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>). Now the clay is hardened; its shape is set. The choice of a completed jar teaches several truths:<p>- Judah has moved from pliable to fixed, refusing repentance despite repeated calls (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-14</a>).<p>- Once hardened, the nation is subject to breaking; a jar that shatters cannot be repaired (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>).<p>- The potter theme affirms God&#8217;s sovereign right over His creation (<a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; <a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21</a>).<p>- Purchasing the jar shows that God&#8217;s judgment is not rash; He takes deliberate steps, giving visible warning before acting (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take some of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests</b><p>Jeremiah is told to bring representatives from both civic and religious spheres, ensuring that the message is witnessed by those responsible for guiding the nation (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10-11</a>). Their inclusion highlights:<p>- Accountability: the shepherds have led the flock astray and must hear God&#8217;s verdict firsthand (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-1.htm">Ezekiel 34:1-6</a>).<p>- Public testimony: multiple witnesses establish every matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p>- Opportunity for national repentance: if leaders heed the warning, people may follow (<a href="/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16-17</a>).<p>- Inevitable judgment if they persist in unbelief (<a href="/jeremiah/5-5.htm">Jeremiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/19-1.htm">Jeremiah 19:1</a> launches a prophetic sign-act grounded in God&#8217;s unchallengeable word. The Lord&#8217;s command to buy a fragile clay jar illustrates Judah&#8217;s hardened state and approaching destruction, while the summons of elders and priests places responsibility squarely on the nation&#8217;s leaders. Together these details affirm that God&#8217;s warnings are clear, His sovereignty is absolute, and repentance remains the only path to avoid the shattering judgment that unyielding sin invites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XIX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">And get a potter's earthen bottle.</span>--The word for "get<span class= "ital">" </span>involves <span class= "ital">buying </span>as the process.
