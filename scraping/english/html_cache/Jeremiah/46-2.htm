Egypt was a significant power in the ancient Near East, often interacting with Israel and Judah. Pharaoh Neco II reigned from 610-595 BC and was known for his military campaigns. His involvement in the region is noted in <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-30</a>, where he killed King Josiah of Judah at Megiddo. This event marked a turning point for Judah, leading to its eventual downfall.<p><b>which was defeated at Carchemish on the Euphrates River</b><br>The Battle of Carchemish, occurring around 605 BC, was a pivotal conflict between the Egyptian forces and the Babylonians. Carchemish was a strategic city located on the Euphrates River, serving as a critical point for controlling trade and military movements. The defeat of Egypt at Carchemish marked the decline of Egyptian influence in the region and the rise of Babylon as the dominant power. This battle is also mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>, highlighting its significance in biblical history.<p><b>by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II, one of the most prominent Babylonian kings, reigned from 605-562 BC. Known for his military prowess and architectural achievements, he played a crucial role in the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His victory at Carchemish solidified his power and set the stage for his later conquests, including the eventual siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-21</a>. Nebuchadnezzar's actions fulfilled several prophecies concerning the judgment of nations, including those found in Jeremiah.<p><b>in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah</b><br>Jehoiakim, son of the reformer King Josiah, reigned over Judah from 609-598 BC. His reign was marked by political instability and shifting allegiances between Egypt and Babylon. The fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign corresponds to 605 BC, aligning with the timing of the Battle of Carchemish. This period was critical for Judah, as it faced increasing pressure from Babylon, leading to its eventual subjugation. Jehoiakim's reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36-24</a>:7, where his failure to heed prophetic warnings contributed to Judah's downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh_neco.htm">Pharaoh Neco</a></b><br>The king of Egypt during the late 7th century BC, known for his military campaigns and involvement in the politics of the Near East.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, a dominant power in the ancient Near East, known for his conquests and the eventual destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/carchemish.htm">Carchemish</a></b><br>A significant ancient city located on the Euphrates River, known for the pivotal battle where Babylon defeated Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah, son of Josiah, whose reign was marked by political turmoil and subjugation to foreign powers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_euphrates_river.htm">The Euphrates River</a></b><br>A major river in the Near East, serving as a strategic location for military campaigns and trade routes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The defeat of Egypt by Babylon illustrates God's control over the rise and fall of empires.

Herodotus (ii. 158, 159) relates as his chief achievements that he anticipated the Suez Canal by endeavouring to connect the Nile with the Red Sea, but was stopped by an oracle, and sent a fleet of Ph?nician ships to circumnavigate Africa. One hundred and twenty thousand lives were said to have been sacrificed in the former enterprise. On desisting from it, he turned his attention to other plans of conquest, defeated the Syrians at Magdolus, near Pelusium, and took Cadytis, a great city of Syria, which Herodotus describes as not much less than Sardis. By some writers this has been identified with the capture of Jerusalem in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-3.htm" title="And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.">2Chronicles 36:3</a>, the name Cadytis being looked on as equivalent to <span class= "ital">Kadusha </span>(=the holy city),and so anticipating the modern Arabic name of <span class= "ital">El-Khuds. </span>Herodotus, however (iii. 5), describes it as being near the coast, and this has led to its being identified with Gaza, or Kedesh-Naphtali, or a Hittite city--Ketesh--on the Orontes, near which the great commercial and. military road turned off for Damascus and the Euphrates. In any case, it was in the course of this invasion, directed against the Babylonian Empire, then ruled by Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar, that he defeated and slew Josiah at Megiddo (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/35-20.htm" title="After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.">2Chronicles 35:20-24</a>), deposed Jehoahaz, and appointed Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-4.htm" title="And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.">2Chronicles 36:4</a>). By some writers, accordingly (R. S. Poole, in Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict. Bible, </span>Art. <span class= "ital">Pharaoh-necho</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Megiddo is identified with the Magdolus of Herodotus. His army advanced, and took the city of Carchemish, by some (Hitzig) identified with Circesium, an island formed by the confluence of the Chaboras and the Euphrates; by others (Rawlinson) with a Hittite city, now <span class= "ital">Jerablus, </span>a corruption of the Greek Hierapolis, much higher up the Euphrates. (See Note on <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>). After the capture Necho appears to have returned to Egypt. Three years later (B.C. 606) Carchemish was taken by Nebuchadnezzar with the almost total defeat of Necho's army, he himself having returned to Egypt, and it is this defeat of which Jeremiah now proceeds to speak as in a song of anticipated triumph at the downfall of the Egyptian oppressor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against Egypt, against the army;</span> rather, <span class="accented">concerning Egypt, concerning the army<span class="cmt_word">.</span> Pharaoh-necho.</span> Necho II., a member of the twenty-sixth Egyptian dynasty, sou of Psametik I. (Psammetichus), who had for a time revived the declining power of Egypt. Herodotus (2:158) credits him with being the first to construct a canal to the Red Sea, which seems an exaggeration (see Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note <span class="accented">ap.</span> Rawlinson), also (4:42) with having caused the circumnavigation of Africa, after which the Phoenician seamen brought back the startling news that they had had the sun upon their right hand. This energetic monarch noticed the decline of Assyria, and, at the battle of Megiddo (Herodotus, 2:159, wrongly says Magdolus or Migdol), reattached Judah to the Egyptian empire. Four years later, at the battle of Carchemish, he himself sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carehemish</span>. This was the great emporium of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. Its true site was discovered by Mr. George Smith, in his last fatal journey, to be at Jerabis or Jirbas, on the right bank of the Euphrates. It was anciently a city of the Kheta (equivalent to Khittim, "Hittites"), but passed to the Assyrians, under Sargon, under whom it attained the highest commercial prosperity, especially after the overthrow of Tyre by Sennacherib. The "mana," or <span class="accented">mina</span>, "of Gargamis" is constantly referred to as a standard weight in the commercial cuneiform inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth year,</span> etc. Marcus Niebuhr wishes to put a stop before these words, so as to make them a definition of the date of the prophecy. He thinks the date of the battle of Carchemish was the third and not the fourth year of Jehoiakim. This view, however, is very uncertain (see Keil), and it is exegetieally very unnatural to detach the closing words of ver. 2 from those which precede. The obvious inference, moreover, from the prophecy (vers. 2-12) is that it was written at or about the time of the battle; a special date for the prophecy did not require to be given. Should Niebuhr's chronological combinations, however, turn out to be correct, the mistake would probably not be that of Jeremiah, nor of his scribe, but of his editor, who may easily have fallen into error in the mere minutiae of chronology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">To Egypt,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
