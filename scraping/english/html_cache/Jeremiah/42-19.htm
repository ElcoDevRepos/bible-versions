In the context of Jeremiah, God often spoke through His prophets to guide and instruct His people. This underscores the authority and divine origin of the message. The phrase reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God actively communicates His will.<p><b>O remnant of Judah</b><br>The term "remnant" refers to the small group of Israelites who survived the Babylonian conquest and exile. This remnant is significant in biblical prophecy, often representing hope and the continuation of God's promises. Historically, the remnant faced uncertainty and fear, seeking guidance for survival. Theologically, the remnant is a recurring theme, symbolizing those who remain faithful to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>&#8216;Do not go to Egypt.&#8217;</b><br>Egypt, in biblical history, is often seen as a place of refuge but also a symbol of reliance on human strength rather than God. The Israelites had a history of turning to Egypt in times of trouble, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>. This command is a test of faith, urging the remnant to trust in God's provision rather than seeking security in a foreign land. It also reflects the historical context where Egypt was a political power, tempting Judah to form alliances.<p><b>Know for sure</b><br>This phrase serves as an emphatic assurance of the certainty and seriousness of God's warning. It highlights the importance of heeding divine instruction and the consequences of disobedience. The certainty of God's word is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His unchanging nature and the reliability of His promises.<p><b>that I have warned you today!</b><br>The warning is immediate and urgent, indicating the critical nature of the decision facing the remnant. It reflects God's mercy in providing guidance and the responsibility of the people to respond appropriately. This warning is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where prophets often served as watchmen, alerting the people to impending danger. The urgency of "today" underscores the need for prompt obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and warnings to His people through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_judah.htm">Remnant of Judah</a></b><br>The remaining people of Judah who survived the Babylonian conquest and are seeking guidance on whether to flee to Egypt for safety.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often seen as a place of refuge but also a symbol of reliance on human strength and past bondage, contrary to trusting in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/warning.htm">Warning</a></b><br>A divine admonition given by God through Jeremiah, cautioning the remnant of Judah against seeking refuge in Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_guidance.htm">Trust in God's Guidance</a></b><br>God&#8217;s instructions, even when they seem counterintuitive, are always for our ultimate good.

Their responsibility is simple: hear and obey (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>- By reminding them that the message originates with &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; Jeremiah underscores God&#8217;s personal involvement and covenant faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O remnant of Judah</b><p>- After Babylon&#8217;s invasion, only a small group remained in the land (<a href="/jeremiah/40-11.htm">Jeremiah 40:11</a>; 41:16). Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s care for a faithful remnant (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>- This phrase signals both hope and accountability: being spared carries the privilege of restoration and the obligation of obedience (<a href="/zephaniah/3-12.htm">Zephaniah 3:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>- The address personalizes the command, making clear that no one in the group is exempt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;Do not go to Egypt.&#8217;</b><p>- Egypt symbolized self-reliance and a return to former bondage (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; 28:68). God had repeatedly warned His people not to look there for security (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a>).<p>- Staying in Judah, though risky, meant trusting the Lord&#8217;s promise of protection (<a href="/jeremiah/42-10.htm">Jeremiah 42:10&#8211;12</a>). Flight to Egypt would signal distrust, invite discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/42-15.htm">Jeremiah 42:15&#8211;18</a>), and reverse the Exodus redemption story (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p>- The command is explicit and unambiguous&#8212;no alternative plan is offered, highlighting God&#8217;s desire for wholehearted faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Know for sure that I have warned you today!</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;know for sure&#8221; eliminates excuses. If they disobey, they cannot claim ignorance (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- &#8220;Today&#8221; stresses urgency; delayed obedience equals disobedience (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12&#8211;15</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s warnings are acts of mercy, giving opportunity to repent and live (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>). Accepting the warning leads to blessing; rejecting it brings judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a> delivers a clear, compassionate command: the Lord Himself instructs the surviving remnant to stay in Judah and trust His protection, not Egypt&#8217;s apparent safety.
