The term "My servant" signifies a special relationship with God, highlighting Israel's chosen status. The command "do not be afraid" is a common biblical exhortation, emphasizing trust in God's protection and faithfulness. This reassurance is given amidst the backdrop of impending judgment and exile, reminding the Israelites of God's enduring covenant with them.<p><b>and do not be dismayed, O Israel</b><br>"Dismayed" suggests a loss of courage or resolution. The repetition of "O Israel" reinforces the message to the entire nation. Historically, Israel faced numerous threats from surrounding nations, leading to fear and uncertainty. This encouragement is a call to maintain faith despite external circumstances, reflecting God's promise to uphold His people.<p><b>For I will surely save you out of a distant place</b><br>This promise of salvation from a "distant place" refers to the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites were taken captive. The assurance of deliverance is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, pointing to God's power to redeem and restore His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from spiritual captivity.<p><b>your descendants from the land of their captivity!</b><br>The mention of "descendants" underscores the continuity of God's promises across generations. The "land of their captivity" specifically refers to Babylon, where the Israelites were exiled. This promise of return is not only physical but also spiritual, symbolizing restoration and renewal. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and the hope of a future where God's people are free from bondage.<p><b>Jacob will return to quiet and ease</b><br>The return to "quiet and ease" signifies peace and security, contrasting with the turmoil of exile. This promise reflects the prophetic vision of a restored Israel living in harmony with God. It echoes the peace that believers find in Christ, who offers rest for the soul. The imagery of returning to a peaceful state is a powerful reminder of God's ability to transform chaos into order.<p><b>with no one to make him afraid</b><br>This assurance of safety highlights the complete protection God provides. In a historical context, Israel often faced threats from powerful empires, but this promise indicates a future where such fears are eliminated. It points to the eschatological hope of a new creation where God's reign is fully realized, and fear is no longer present. This ultimate peace is fulfilled in the kingdom of God, where Christ reigns supreme.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, often referred to as "Jacob" in prophetic literature, symbolizing the collective identity of the Israelites as descendants of Jacob.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are in captivity but are promised deliverance and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/captivity.htm">Captivity</a></b><br>Refers to the Babylonian exile, a period when the Israelites were taken from their homeland and held in Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/deliverance.htm">Deliverance</a></b><br>God's promise to bring the Israelites back from exile, restoring them to their land and giving them peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of hope and reassurance to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_deliverance.htm">God's Faithfulness in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises.

History verifies the initial return from Babylon; prophecy assures an ultimate, everlasting rest. The passage anchors hope in God&#8217;s unbreakable word and character: He chooses, protects, restores, and finally grants His people fearless, restful security.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27, 28) <span class= "bld">Fear not thou, O my servant Jacob . . .</span>--The words that follow are found also in <a href="/context/jeremiah/30-10.htm" title="Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.">Jeremiah 30:10-11</a>, and have been commented on there, and were either inserted here by the prophet himself, or by some later editor of his writings, as an appropriate conclusion, contrasting the care of Jehovah for His people with the sentence upon the power in which they were trusting for protection. Why should they insist, as in <a href="/jeremiah/43-7.htm" title="So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.">Jeremiah 43:7</a>, on placing themselves in a position which would involve them in the destruction which the prophet thus foretells? The words, it may be noticed, are a manifest echo of the words of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm" title="For I the LORD your God will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.">Isaiah 41:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-5.htm" title="Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;">Isaiah 43:5</a>). Such a consolation was, we may well believe, needed by the people when they saw the armies of Nebuchadnezzar laying waste the country in whose protection they had trusted, and where they had hoped to find a home. Better things, they are told, were in store for them, even a return to the land of their fathers.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - A word of comfort to Israel, obviously not written at the same time as the preceding prophecy. The prophet is suddenly transported in imagination into the period of the Babylonian exile. Egypt and its fortunes are far away; the troubles of Israel entirely absorb his attention. After thinking sadly of the reverses of his people, he bursts out with an encouraging exhortation not to fear, though, humanly speaking, there was everything to fear. Did Jeremiah write these verses here? There is strong reason to doubt it; for they occur, with insignificant variations, in <a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10, 11</a>, where they cohere far better with the context than here. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
