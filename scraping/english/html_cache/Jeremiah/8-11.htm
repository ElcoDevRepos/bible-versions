The "daughter of My people" refers to the nation of Israel, often personified as a daughter in prophetic literature. The leaders and prophets of the time were offering inadequate solutions to the deep-seated issues facing the nation. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God condemns leaders who fail to address the true needs of His people (<a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>). The imagery of "dressing a wound" suggests a temporary or cosmetic fix rather than a genuine healing, indicating negligence and a lack of true pastoral care.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Peace, peace,&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of "peace" emphasizes the false assurances given by the prophets and leaders. In the historical context, this was a time of impending judgment and disaster due to the people's unfaithfulness and idolatry. The leaders were proclaiming peace to maintain a false sense of security, ignoring the warnings of true prophets like Jeremiah. This false prophecy of peace is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where leaders often prioritized their own comfort and status over the truth (<a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>).<p><b>when there is no peace at all</b><br>This phrase underscores the reality of the situation: despite the leaders' assurances, true peace was absent. The absence of peace is both a physical reality, with the threat of Babylonian invasion, and a spiritual reality, as the people were estranged from God due to their sin. This reflects the biblical principle that true peace comes only from a right relationship with God (<a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>). The false prophets' message of peace is contrasted with the true peace that Jesus Christ offers, as He is the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), who reconciles humanity to God through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
