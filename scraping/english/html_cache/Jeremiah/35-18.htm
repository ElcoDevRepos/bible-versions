This encounter takes place in the context of a test of obedience, where the Rechabites are brought into the temple and offered wine, which they refuse, demonstrating their commitment to their ancestral vows. The Rechabites' lifestyle contrasts with the Israelites' disobedience, serving as a living parable for the people of Judah.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. It underscores the authority of the message being delivered. The phrase "the God of Israel" reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people, Israel. This introduction is typical of prophetic declarations, indicating that the message is not Jeremiah's own but divinely inspired.<p><b>&#8216;Because you have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab</b><br>Jonadab, son of Rechab, was a key figure during the time of King Jehu, known for his zeal in eradicating Baal worship from Israel (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15-23</a>). His commands to his descendants included abstaining from wine, not building houses, and living in tents, which were meant to preserve their nomadic lifestyle and set them apart from the surrounding cultures. The Rechabites' obedience to Jonadab's commands is highlighted as exemplary, contrasting with the disobedience of the Israelites to God's commands.<p><b>and have kept all his commandments</b><br>The Rechabites' faithfulness in keeping Jonadab's commandments is a testament to their respect for tradition and authority. This obedience is not just in abstaining from wine but in maintaining a lifestyle that reflects their ancestor's values. Their commitment serves as a rebuke to the people of Judah, who have failed to keep God's commandments despite His repeated warnings through the prophets.<p><b>and have done all that he charged you to do,</b><br>The Rechabites' complete adherence to Jonadab's instructions is emphasized here. Their actions are a model of faithfulness and integrity, demonstrating the importance of obedience to rightful authority. This phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of their obedience, which includes both specific actions and a broader lifestyle commitment. The Rechabites' example serves as a prophetic illustration of the blessings that come from obedience, foreshadowing the ultimate obedience of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the will of His Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>). What he was taught to praise was the steadfastness and loyalty with which they adhered to a merely human precept, not at variance with the letter of any divine law, and designed, like the Nazarite vow, to carry the spirit of that law--the idea of a life-long consecration--to its highest point. The temper of faithfulness to any rule of life sanctioned by prescription, whether it be that of a school, a college, a guild, or a religious order, is in itself praiseworthy as compared with that of individual self-assertion and self-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - A promise to the Rechabites (perhaps removed from its original connection).
