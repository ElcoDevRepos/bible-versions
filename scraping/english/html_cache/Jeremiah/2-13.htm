The term "My people" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, underscoring the gravity of their betrayal. The concept of "two evils" suggests a complete turning away from God, reminiscent of the dual nature of sin seen in the Ten Commandments, where both actions and attitudes are addressed.<p><b>They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water:</b><br>God is depicted as the "fountain of living water," symbolizing life, sustenance, and purity. This imagery is rooted in the geographical context of ancient Israel, where water was a precious resource. The forsaking of God is akin to rejecting the source of life itself. This metaphor is echoed in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>, where Jesus offers the Samaritan woman "living water," drawing a parallel between God's provision and Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>and they have dug their own cisterns&#8212;</b><br>Cisterns were man-made reservoirs used to collect rainwater, common in the arid regions of Israel. This phrase illustrates the futility of relying on human efforts and wisdom instead of God's provision. The act of digging cisterns represents self-reliance and idolatry, as the Israelites sought security and satisfaction apart from God. This is reminiscent of the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>), where humanity attempted to reach heaven through their own means.<p><b>broken cisterns that cannot hold water:</b><br>The "broken cisterns" symbolize the failure of false gods and human endeavors to provide true fulfillment and security. This imagery highlights the inadequacy and impermanence of anything apart from God. The brokenness signifies the inevitable disappointment and spiritual drought that results from turning away from the divine source. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1-2</a>, where God invites His people to seek sustenance in Him rather than in things that do not satisfy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, warning them of their idolatry and urging them to return to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "My people" by God, they are the chosen nation who have turned away from Him, committing spiritual adultery by worshiping other gods.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fountain_of_living_water.htm">The Fountain of Living Water</a></b><br>A metaphor for God Himself, representing His life-giving and sustaining power, purity, and the source of true spiritual nourishment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/broken_cisterns.htm">Broken Cisterns</a></b><br>Symbolic of the false gods and idols that the Israelites have turned to, which are inadequate and incapable of providing true spiritual sustenance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_judah.htm">The Land of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jeremiah's ministry primarily took place, and where the people had fallen into idolatry and sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_idolatry.htm">Recognizing Idolatry</a></b><br>Identify and reject modern-day "broken cisterns" in our lives, such as materialism, self-reliance, or any pursuit that takes precedence over God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_the_true_source.htm">Seeking the True Source</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of turning to God, the fountain of living water, for spiritual nourishment and fulfillment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_forsaking_god.htm">The Consequences of Forsaking God</a></b><br>Understand the spiritual emptiness and dissatisfaction that result from turning away from God and relying on inadequate substitutes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_and_invitation.htm">God's Faithfulness and Invitation</a></b><br>Despite our failures, God continually invites us back to Him, offering forgiveness and restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_water_in_christ.htm">Living Water in Christ</a></b><br>Recognize that Jesus is the fulfillment of the promise of living water, offering eternal life and satisfaction to all who believe in Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_2_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 2:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_2_13_Two_evils_of_God_s_people.htm">How does Jeremiah 2:13 describe the two evils committed by God's people?

Who would prefer such an impure supply to the sweet, wholesome water of a fountain? But these cisterns cannot even be depended upon for this poor, turbid drink. They are "broken," like so many even of the best rock-hewn cisterns (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 287). How fine a description of the combined attractiveness and disappointingness of heathen religions, qualities the more striking in proportion to the scale on which the religions problem is realized (e.g. in Hinduism)! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
