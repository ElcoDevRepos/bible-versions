This metaphor highlights the futility and deception involved in acquiring wealth through unjust means. The partridge's actions are ultimately fruitless, as the eggs will not produce offspring that belong to it. This reflects the biblical principle that ill-gotten gains are temporary and ultimately unsatisfying. The imagery may also connect to themes in <a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>, which warns about the fleeting nature of wealth.<p><b>is the man who makes a fortune unjustly.</b><br>The focus here is on the moral and ethical implications of acquiring wealth through unjust means. In the historical context of Jeremiah, this could refer to corrupt practices among the leaders and people of Judah, who were often rebuked by the prophets for their exploitation and injustice. The Bible consistently condemns dishonest gain, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/13-11.htm">Proverbs 13:11</a> and <a href="/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10-12</a>. This phrase serves as a warning against the temptation to prioritize wealth over righteousness.<p><b>In the middle of his days his riches will desert him,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the temporary nature of wealth obtained through unjust means. The phrase "in the middle of his days" suggests an unexpected and premature loss, highlighting the instability and insecurity of such riches. This aligns with the biblical theme that God will ultimately bring justice, as seen in <a href="/job/27-16.htm">Job 27:16-17</a> and <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:13-14</a>, where wealth can quickly vanish or be taken away.<p><b>and in the end he will be the fool.</b><br>The conclusion of the verse underscores the ultimate folly of pursuing wealth through unjust means. In biblical terms, a "fool" is someone who acts without regard for God's wisdom and righteousness. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>, where the rich man who hoards wealth is called a fool because he is not "rich toward God." The verse serves as a sobering reminder that true wisdom and security come from living in accordance with God's principles, not from the accumulation of material wealth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.

Honest labor, contentment, and trust in the Lord endure; deceitful gain never does.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">As the partridge sitteth on eggs . . .</span>--Better, following the LXX. and Vulg., and the marginal reading of the Authorised Version, <span class= "ital">heaps up eggs and hath not laid them. </span>The words point to a popular belief among the Jews that the partridge steals the eggs of other birds and adds them to her own, with the result that when the eggs are hatched the broods desert her (see <span class= "ital">Bibl. Educ. </span>iii. p. 73). It thus became a parable of the covetous man, whose avarice leads him to pile up riches which are not rightly his, and which after a while "make to themselves wings" and are seen no more. Modern naturalists have not observed this habit, but it is probable that the belief originated in the practice of the cuckoo laying its eggs in the nest of the partridge, as in that of other birds. The cuckoo (<a href="/leviticus/11-16.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Leviticus 11:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-15.htm" title="And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,">Deuteronomy 14:15</a>) was and is a common bird in Palestine (<span class= "ital">Bibl. Educ. </span>2 p. 363).<p><span class= "bld">Shall leave them in the midst of his days.</span>--If we retain the rendering of the Authorised Version the words may refer to the practice of hunting the partridge by driving it from its nest and then striking it with a club (see <span class= "ital">Bibl. Educ. </span>iii. p. 73). Many commentators, however, adopt the rendering, <span class= "ital">they </span>(the riches) <span class= "ital">shall leave him. </span>As covetousness was the besetting sin of Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm" title="But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.">Jeremiah 22:17</a>), the prediction may have pointed specially to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the partridge... hatcheth them not</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">the partridge sitteth on eggs which it hath not laid</span>; a proverbial illustration of the Divine retributive justice. The prophet assumes the truth of a popular belief respecting the partridge (still a common bird in Judaea), that it brooded upon eggs which it had not laid. As the young birds soon leave the false mother, so unjustly acquired riches soon forsake their possessors. [Canon Tristram rejects this explanation, on the ground that the statement is not true to natural history; the partridge neither steals the broods of others nor needs to do so, as it lays a very large number of eggs.
