Hezekiah is noted for his religious reforms and efforts to return Judah to the worship of Yahweh, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. The rhetorical question highlights the precedent set by Hezekiah, who did not execute the prophet Micah despite his dire prophecies. This context underscores the importance of heeding prophetic warnings rather than silencing the messenger, a principle rooted in the respect for God's word and His messengers.<p><b>Did Hezekiah not fear the LORD and seek His favor,</b><br>Hezekiah's fear of the LORD is a central theme in his reign, as he is described as a king who trusted in God and sought to align his kingdom with divine will. This fear, or reverence, led him to seek God's favor through prayer and reform, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19:1-19</a>, where he prays for deliverance from the Assyrian threat. The concept of fearing the LORD is foundational in biblical wisdom literature, such as <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, and is associated with obedience and humility before God.<p><b>and did not the LORD relent of the disaster He had pronounced against them?</b><br>This phrase refers to God's response to Hezekiah's repentance and prayer. In <a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-36</a>, God relents from allowing the Assyrian army to destroy Jerusalem, demonstrating His mercy and willingness to forgive when His people turn back to Him. This relenting is consistent with God's character as described in passages like <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, where He is portrayed as gracious and compassionate. It also illustrates the biblical principle that genuine repentance can lead to divine mercy and averted judgment.<p><b>But we are about to bring great harm on ourselves!&#8221;</b><br>The warning here is a self-reflective acknowledgment of the potential consequences of rejecting God's prophets. The leaders of Judah, by contemplating the execution of Jeremiah, risked incurring divine wrath similar to what they were trying to avoid. This phrase serves as a cautionary reminder of the dangers of ignoring God's warnings, as seen throughout the history of Israel and Judah, where disobedience often led to disaster. It echoes the broader biblical theme that rebellion against God leads to self-inflicted harm, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>'s blessings and curses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>King of Judah known for his faithfulness to God and his reforms to restore proper worship in Judah.

Hezekiah&#8217;s reaction to Micah&#8217;s prophecy is summarized as &#8220;fear of the LORD,&#8221; the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), and an earnest seeking of God&#8217;s face (2 Chron 29&#8211;31 record his reforms).<p>&#8226; Hezekiah led national repentance:<p>&#8211; Tore down idols (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Restored temple worship (2 Chron 29:20-36).<p>&#8211; Celebrated the Passover with invitation to all Israel (2 Chron 30).<p>&#8226; His example demonstrates that godly leadership responds to warning with humility, not hostility (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not the LORD relent of the disaster He had pronounced against them?</b><p>&#8226; Because Hezekiah and the nation repented, the Lord &#8220;relented&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/18-8.htm">Jeremiah 18:8</a>; <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). God&#8217;s character is unchanging, yet His dealings with people shift when they turn from sin to obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, Judah experienced deliverance from Assyria when God struck down 185,000 soldiers (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-36</a>), a clear confirmation that repentance invites mercy (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; This relenting is never a sign of divine indecision but of covenant faithfulness&#8212;God honors His promise to forgive the contrite (<a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But we are about to bring great harm on ourselves!</b><p>&#8226; The elders&#8217; final warning is urgent: rejecting Jeremiah would repeat the mistakes of earlier wicked kings such as Jehoiakim, who did kill a prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking Hezekiah&#8217;s positive model, they expose the current leaders&#8217; peril: act in unbelief and they &#8220;bring great harm&#8221; (self-inflicted judgment) on the nation (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores individual and corporate responsibility; they cannot blame Babylon alone if they refuse the Lord&#8217;s call to repentance (<a href="/lamentations/1-8.htm">Lamentations 1:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-19.htm">Jeremiah 26:19</a> uses Hezekiah&#8217;s era as a living parable. When earlier Judah heard Micah&#8217;s warning, they honored the prophet, feared the LORD, repented, and received mercy. Therefore, the present generation must imitate that faith-filled response rather than silence God&#8217;s messenger. The verse teaches that true fear of God welcomes correction, repentance averts judgment, and rejecting prophetic truth invites disastrous consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Did Hezekiah . . . put him at all to death?</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make him die the death, </span>the same phrase as in <a href="/jeremiah/26-8.htm" title="Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall surely die.">Jeremiah 26:8</a>. There is no special record of the repentance thus referred to, but it is quite in accord with Hezekiah's general character, as seen in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/29-6.htm" title="For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.">2Chronicles 29:6-10</a> (which may be the occasion referred to) and <a href="/2_chronicles/32-26.htm" title="Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not on them in the days of Hezekiah.">2Chronicles 32:26</a>. The whole tone of the advice of "old experience," approximating to something like "prophetic strain," in this case, reminds us of the counsels of Gamaliel in <a href="/context/acts/5-35.htm" title="And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.">Acts 5:35-39</a>. The closing words, "Thus might we procure great evil to our souls," present an exact parallel to "lest haply we be found even to fight against God." The result of the counsel thus given is left to be inferred. It obviously left the prophet free to continue his work as a preacher, though probably under a kind of police surveillance, like that implied in <a href="/context/jeremiah/36-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 36:1-5</a>. The favourable result is attributed in <a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a> to the influence of Ahikam. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus might we procure</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">and we are about to commit a great evil against our souls</span> (not merely "against ourselves").
