His messages were often met with resistance and persecution.<p><b>from the LORD</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the translation of the Hebrew name for God, YHWH, often pronounced as Yahweh. This name is considered sacred and denotes God's eternal, self-existent nature. It highlights the covenant relationship between God and His people, reminding them of His faithfulness and their obligations under the covenant.

No date is given, and we are driven to infer it from the internal evidence of the message itself. This points to an early period of Jeremiah's work, probably in the reign of Josiah. The invasion of the Chaldeans is not so near, as in the preceding chapter. Jeremiah is still residing at Anathoth (<a href="/jeremiah/11-21.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:">Jeremiah 11:21</a>).
