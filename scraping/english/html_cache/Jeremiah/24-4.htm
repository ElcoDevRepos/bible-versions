&#8220;Then&#8221; links directly to the vision just given (<a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; It signals God&#8217;s timely response: once the prophet sees, God immediately interprets.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses &#8220;then&#8221; to mark decisive divine action after human observation (cf. <a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>).<p>Meaning for us: God never leaves His people guessing; revelation follows revelation in perfect sequence, assuring that what He shows, He also explains (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Not Jeremiah&#8217;s insight but God&#8217;s authoritative word&#8212;&#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; is repeated throughout the book (<a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>; 2:1; 16:1), underscoring inspiration and inerrancy (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This phrase stresses that what follows carries divine weight equal to creation&#8217;s command (&#8220;By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,&#8221; <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Because it is God&#8217;s word, the promise of judgment and restoration in the fig-basket vision is guaranteed (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>&#8226; The initiative is God&#8217;s; Jeremiah does not seek an explanation&#8212;he receives it.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Came to me&#8221; highlights the personal, relational nature of revelation (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets are moved &#8220;by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>); the encounter is intimate yet authoritative (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>Application: God still brings His word to willing servants, often through Scripture illuminated by the Spirit (<a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>).<p>---<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; God speaks in intelligible, discernible words.<p>&#8226; What follows (vv. 5-10) is not cryptic symbolism left to guesswork but explicit explanation: the good figs represent exiles God will restore; the bad figs represent those remaining in rebellion.<p>&#8226; Similar pattern: vision plus verbal explanation occurs with Amos&#8217;s plumb line (<a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7-9</a>) and Zechariah&#8217;s lampstand (<a href="/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1-6</a>).<p>Takeaway: God&#8217;s revealed word interprets God&#8217;s revealed works;
