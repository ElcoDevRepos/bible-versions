This phrase indicates the role of a prophet as a spokesperson for God, often delivering messages of warning and judgment. The context here is the impending Babylonian exile, a consequence of the people's persistent disobedience. Prophets like Jeremiah were often met with resistance and disbelief, as seen throughout his ministry (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-10</a>).<p><b>they will ask you, &#8216;Why has the LORD pronounced all this great disaster against us?</b><br>The people's question reflects a lack of understanding or acknowledgment of their sin. Despite repeated warnings from prophets, they are surprised by the severity of God's judgment. This disaster refers to the Babylonian conquest and exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The question also highlights a common human tendency to question divine justice when faced with suffering, similar to the questioning seen in the Book of Job.<p><b>What is our iniquity?</b><br>Iniquity refers to moral corruption or wickedness. The people of Judah are portrayed as being unaware or in denial of their wrongdoing. This reflects a spiritual blindness or hardening of heart, a theme prevalent in the Old Testament (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). The iniquity of Judah included idolatry, social injustice, and breaking the covenant with God, as detailed in earlier chapters of Jeremiah.<p><b>What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?&#8217;</b><br>Sin, in this context, is a violation of God's law and covenant. The people&#8217;s question indicates a disconnect between their actions and the consequences they face. Historically, the sins of Judah included idol worship, neglecting the Sabbath, and failing to uphold justice and righteousness (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>). This question also underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where sin is not just a personal failing but a breach of a sacred agreement. The phrase "against the LORD our God" emphasizes the personal nature of their rebellion against a God who had chosen them as His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

"What have we done to call for all this? In what are we worse than our fathers, or than other nations?" All prophets had more or less to encounter the same hardness. It reaches its highest form in the reiterated questions of the same type in Malachi 1, 2.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/16-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;ag&#183;g&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
