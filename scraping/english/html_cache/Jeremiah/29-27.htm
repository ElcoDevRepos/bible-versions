Anathoth, a town in the territory of Benjamin, was Jeremiah's hometown, indicating his roots in a priestly family (<a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). The call to rebuke suggests a tension between Jeremiah and the established religious authorities, who were often resistant to his messages of impending judgment. This tension is a recurring theme in Jeremiah's ministry, as he frequently faced opposition from those who rejected his prophetic warnings.<p><b>who poses as a prophet among you?</b><br>The accusation that Jeremiah "poses as a prophet" implies skepticism about his divine calling. This reflects the broader context of false prophets in Jerusalem who contradicted Jeremiah's messages, offering false hope of peace and security (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14, 23</a>:16-17). The struggle between true and false prophecy is a significant theme in the book of Jeremiah, highlighting the challenge of discerning God's true messengers. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, the ultimate Prophet, faced similar accusations and skepticism from religious leaders (<a href="/matthew/21-11.htm">Matthew 21:11</a>, <a href="/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40-52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet from Anathoth, called by God to deliver messages to the people of Judah.

Compare <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10&#8211;13</a>, where Amaziah tries to banish Amos.<p>&#8211; True spiritual leadership does include rebuke when doctrine or conduct is unsound (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>), but here the demand is misplaced: Jeremiah speaks faithfully (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>), while Shemaiah utters deception (<a href="/jeremiah/29-31.htm">Jeremiah 29:31&#8211;32</a>).<p>&#8211; The mention of &#8220;Anathoth&#8221; highlights Jeremiah&#8217;s hometown&#8212;a village of priestly lineage (<a href="/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>). Ironically, a fellow priest is asked to censure him, echoing Jesus&#8217; later rejection in His own region (<a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>).<p>&#8211; Key takeaway: religious titles or locations never guarantee spiritual accuracy; alignment with God&#8217;s word does (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who poses as a prophet among you?</b><p>&#8211; Shemaiah labels Jeremiah an impostor, flipping reality.

Discernment requires testing every spirit against revealed truth (<a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>).<p>&#8211; Jeremiah&#8217;s life itself authenticated his calling&#8212;suffering, opposition, but unwavering fidelity (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-3.htm">2 Corinthians 6:3&#8211;10</a>).

The verse exposes a timeless pattern: false voices often wear religious credentials and attempt to silence God&#8217;s messengers.
