This reflects the prophet's role as a messenger of God's protection and promise. Historically, Zedekiah was caught between the pressures of his officials and the threat of Babylon, highlighting the political turmoil of the time. This assurance is reminiscent of God's promises of protection found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3-7</a>.<p><b>Jeremiah replied.</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," often faced opposition and danger for delivering God's messages. His response here is consistent with his character as a faithful servant of God, willing to speak truth to power despite personal risk. This moment underscores the prophet's commitment to his divine mission, similar to other prophets like Elijah and Isaiah.<p><b>Obey the voice of the LORD</b><br>The call to obedience is a central theme in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of following God's commands. In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, this obedience is crucial for the survival and well-being of the people. The phrase echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. It also foreshadows the New Testament call to follow Christ's teachings.<p><b>in what I am telling you,</b><br>Jeremiah's message is not his own but a direct communication from God. This highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. The phrase underscores the importance of heeding prophetic warnings, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Noah and Jonah, who delivered messages of impending judgment and the need for repentance.<p><b>that it may go well with you</b><br>This promise of well-being is contingent upon obedience, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. It is a recurring biblical theme that obedience leads to blessings, as seen in the lives of individuals like Joseph and Daniel, who prospered because of their faithfulness to God.<p><b>and you may live.</b><br>The promise of life is both physical and spiritual, emphasizing the ultimate goal of God's commands: the preservation and flourishing of His people. This assurance of life is a common biblical motif, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life through obedience to God is encouraged. It also points to the New Testament promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
