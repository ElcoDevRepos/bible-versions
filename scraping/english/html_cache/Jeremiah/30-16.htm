In the context of Jeremiah, this is a message of hope for Israel, who has been oppressed by various nations. The concept of "devouring" is often used in the Bible to describe the destructive actions of enemies (e.g., <a href="/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>). This promise of reversal is consistent with God's covenantal faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants and curse those who curse them.<p><b>and all your adversaries&#8212;every one of them&#8212;will go off into exile</b><br>The mention of exile is significant, as it was a common form of judgment in the ancient Near East. The Babylonians, who were responsible for the exile of Judah, would themselves face exile as a form of divine justice. This prophecy was fulfilled when Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The comprehensive nature of the judgment ("every one of them") underscores the totality of God's justice and His ability to protect His people.<p><b>Those who plundered you will be plundered</b><br>Plundering was a common practice in ancient warfare, where victors would take spoils from the defeated. This phrase promises a reversal of fortunes, where those who have taken from Israel will themselves be stripped of their wealth. This is reminiscent of the Exodus narrative, where the Israelites plundered the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>) as they left slavery, symbolizing God's deliverance and provision for His people.<p><b>and all who raided you will be raided</b><br>Raiding was a tactic used by nomadic tribes and nations to weaken and impoverish their enemies. This promise of retribution assures Israel that God will turn the tables on their oppressors. The cyclical nature of this justice is seen throughout the Bible, where God often uses the same methods of judgment on the oppressors as they used on their victims (e.g., <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>). This reflects the biblical principle of "measure for measure" justice, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often subject to foreign oppression due to their disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversaries.htm">Adversaries</a></b><br>Nations and peoples who have oppressed and attacked Israel and Judah throughout history.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>A recurring theme in the history of Israel and Judah, often seen as a consequence of disobedience but also a tool for eventual restoration.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of God to bring back His people from exile and restore them to their land, symbolizing hope and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's promise to repay those who harm His people assures us of His ultimate justice.
