The act of setting wine before them is significant, as wine in biblical times was a common beverage, often used in celebrations and religious rituals. The use of pitchers indicates a generous offering, suggesting abundance. This act serves as a test of obedience and faithfulness to the Rechabites' ancestral commands. The setting of wine before them is symbolic, representing the temptations and challenges faced by believers in maintaining their commitments to God.<p><b>and some cups before the men of the house of the Rechabites</b><br>The Rechabites were a nomadic clan descended from Jonadab, son of Rechab. They were known for their strict adherence to a lifestyle of abstinence from wine, living in tents, and not engaging in agriculture, as commanded by their ancestor Jonadab (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15-23</a>). The mention of "cups" emphasizes the personal choice each individual must make when faced with temptation. The Rechabites' presence in Jerusalem during this time of testing highlights their faithfulness amidst a society that had largely turned away from God's commands.<p><b>and I said to them, &#8220;Drink some wine.&#8221;</b><br>Jeremiah's command to the Rechabites to drink wine serves as a direct challenge to their commitment to their ancestral vow. This test is not meant to lead them into sin but to demonstrate their steadfastness and integrity. The Rechabites' refusal to drink the wine, as seen in the following verses, becomes a powerful testimony against the people of Judah, who had failed to obey God's commands. This scenario foreshadows the testing of Jesus Christ in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where He too was presented with temptations but remained faithful to His Father's will. The Rechabites' obedience serves as a model for believers, illustrating the importance of faithfulness and the strength found in adhering to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Jeremiah is acting on the Lord&#8217;s explicit instruction (<a href="/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2&#8211;4</a>), demonstrating the prophet&#8217;s immediate obedience&#8212;an example that highlights how God&#8217;s servants carry out His word without hesitation (cf. <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>; <a href="/john/2-5.htm">John 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The abundance of wine in &#8220;pitchers&#8221; signals a genuine provision, not a token gesture. The test would be meaningless if the supply were scarce. Compare God&#8217;s principle of testing faithfulness with real options, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a> or <a href="/luke/4-3.htm">Luke 4:3&#8211;4</a>.<p>&#8226; The scene recalls <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, where God prepares a table &#8220;in the presence of my enemies,&#8221; underscoring that provision itself is not sin; the moral issue arises in how one responds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and some cups</b><p>&#8226; Cups make personal participation possible&#8212;each man could easily comply. This mirrors how God ensures human freedom to obey or refuse (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The readiness of cups evokes <a href="/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31</a>, &#8220;Do not gaze at wine when it sparkles,&#8221; reminding readers that temptation is often packaged with convenience.<p>&#8226; The detail also stresses ceremony: a formal setting inside the temple chambers elevates the test&#8217;s seriousness (<a href="/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before the men of the house of the Rechabites</b><p>&#8226; The Rechabites trace back to Jonadab son of Rechab, who championed zeal for God&#8217;s purity during Jehu&#8217;s reforms (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15&#8211;16</a>). Their clan identity centers on loyalty to ancestral commands.<p>&#8226; By placing the wine &#8220;before&#8221; them, Jeremiah confronts the whole family together, highlighting communal accountability (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/acts/16-31.htm">Acts 16:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence in the temple underscores that faithfulness is examined under God&#8217;s gaze, not in private corners (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I said to them</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah speaks with prophetic authority. Although the invitation comes from a man, its deeper significance is divine (<a href="/jeremiah/35-13.htm">Jeremiah 35:13</a>). God often tests people through human messengers (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows that God&#8217;s commands are clear and understandable; Israel&#8217;s excuses for disobedience will not stand (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Speech precedes response; hearing precedes obedience or rejection (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Drink some wine.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The straightforward command frames the test: will the Rechabites honor their forefather&#8217;s vow never to drink wine (<a href="/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6</a>) or surrender under pressure?<p>&#8226; Their abstinence parallels Nazirite dedication (<a href="/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2&#8211;4</a>) and Daniel&#8217;s refusal of royal rations (<a href="/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), illustrating voluntary self-denial for higher loyalty.<p>&#8226; God contrasts their steadfastness with Judah&#8217;s repeated refusal to heed His word (<a href="/jeremiah/35-14.htm">Jeremiah 35:14&#8211;16</a>), exposing the nation&#8217;s guilt.<p>&#8226; The episode emphasizes that obedience is measured not by convenience but by conviction (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Jeremiah 35:5</a> records Jeremiah setting a generous, convenient, and explicit invitation to drink wine before the Rechabites. Every detail&#8212;the ample pitchers, ready cups, public setting, verbal command&#8212;intensifies the test of their fidelity to an inherited vow. Their forthcoming refusal will showcase steadfast obedience, sharply contrasting Judah&#8217;s chronic rebellion. The verse teaches that God sometimes uses legitimate offers to reveal genuine loyalty, proving that true faithfulness clings to His word even when compliance seems easy and socially acceptable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pots full of wine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">bowls</span>, large round vessels (<span class="accented">crateres</span>), out of which the drinking cups were filled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;et&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
