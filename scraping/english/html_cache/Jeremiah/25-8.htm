The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's command over heavenly armies, indicating His power and ability to execute judgment. This title is frequently used in prophetic literature to remind the audience of God's supreme authority (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>, <a href="/malachi/1-14.htm">Malachi 1:14</a>).<p><b>Because you have not obeyed My words:</b><br>This phrase highlights the reason for the impending judgment: disobedience to God's commands. The context of <a href="/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a> is a warning to Judah for their persistent rebellion and idolatry. Historically, this disobedience includes neglecting the covenantal laws given through Moses (Deuteronomy 28) and ignoring the prophetic warnings delivered by Jeremiah and other prophets. This disobedience is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, leading to consequences such as exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). The call to obedience is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people, and failure to adhere to His words results in divine discipline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s &#8220;Therefore&#8221; links His coming action directly to Judah&#8217;s long-standing refusal to heed His prophets. By identifying Himself as &#8220;the LORD of Hosts,&#8221; He emphasizes that He has both the authority and the resources to carry out His decree. The root issue is unmistakable: the people have not obeyed His words. In every age, the verse reminds us that God&#8217;s announcements of discipline are grounded in His unchanging holiness and the clear, gracious calls of His written word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1429;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1429;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">obeyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My words,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
