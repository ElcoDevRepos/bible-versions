It symbolizes a call to action and unity among the people. Biblically, banners often represent God's presence and guidance (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>). Here, it signifies the beginning of God's judgment against Babylon, a theme prevalent in Jeremiah's prophecies.<p><b>Blow the ram&#8217;s horn among the nations!</b><br>The ram's horn, or shofar, was used in Israel for various purposes, including calling people to worship, signaling the start of a battle, or announcing significant events (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). Its use here indicates a divine summons to the nations to participate in the impending judgment against Babylon, emphasizing the seriousness and urgency of the call.<p><b>Prepare the nations against her.</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine orchestration of international forces against Babylon. Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, and its fall required a coalition of nations. This preparation reflects God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use them to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Daniel.<p><b>Summon the kingdoms against her&#8212;Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.</b><br>These regions correspond to areas in modern-day Turkey and Armenia. Ararat is known from the Genesis account of Noah's Ark (<a href="/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>). Minni and Ashkenaz are less well-known but were part of the Median Empire. Their mention highlights the widespread nature of the coalition against Babylon and fulfills the prophecy of Babylon's downfall through a diverse alliance.<p><b>Appoint a captain against her;</b><br>The appointment of a captain signifies leadership and strategy in the military campaign against Babylon. This reflects God's control over the events, as He appoints leaders to execute His judgment. It also foreshadows the rise of leaders like Cyrus the Great, who played a crucial role in Babylon's fall, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>.<p><b>Bring up horses like swarming locusts.</b><br>Horses were a symbol of military strength and speed in ancient times. The imagery of swarming locusts conveys overwhelming numbers and an unstoppable force, reminiscent of the locust plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>). This metaphor emphasizes the totality and inevitability of Babylon's destruction, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine retribution against oppressive powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ararat.htm">Ararat</a></b><br>A region historically associated with the mountains where Noah's Ark came to rest. It is located in modern-day Turkey and is often seen as a symbol of God's judgment and deliverance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/minni.htm">Minni</a></b><br>A lesser-known kingdom, possibly located in the region of Armenia. It is mentioned in conjunction with Ararat and Ashkenaz, indicating its role in the coalition against Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashkenaz.htm">Ashkenaz</a></b><br>A people or region associated with the descendants of Japheth, one of Noah's sons. It is often linked to areas in modern-day Europe or Asia Minor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire against which the nations are being summoned. Babylon is a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/commander.htm">Commander</a></b><br>A leader appointed to organize the coalition of nations against Babylon. This figure represents God's sovereignty in orchestrating the downfall of empires.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of the rise and fall of nations.

It also points to the deliverance of His people, encouraging us to trust in His ultimate plan for redemption.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_god's_purpose.htm">Unity in God's Purpose</a></b><br>The coalition of diverse nations against a common enemy illustrates the unity that can be found in pursuing God's purposes.

It also announces that the time of Babylon&#8217;s seeming invincibility is over, just as God had promised years earlier (<a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blow the ram&#8217;s horn among the nations!</b><p>&#8211;

God Himself readies these armies, proving His sovereignty over all peoples (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase underscores that Babylon&#8217;s downfall is certain and imminent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summon the kingdoms against her&#8212;Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.</b><p>&#8211;

Historically fulfilled by the Medo-Persian conquest, the verse also foreshadows the final overthrow of every Babylon-like world system when Christ returns (<a href="/bsb/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17-18</a>).
