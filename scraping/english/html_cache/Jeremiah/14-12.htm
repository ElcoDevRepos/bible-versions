Fasting, a common practice in ancient Israel, was often used to express repentance and seek God's favor. However, God declares that He will not listen to their cries, indicating that their fasting is insincere or that their repentance is not genuine. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires obedience and a contrite heart over ritualistic practices (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-7</a>). The people's failure to turn from their idolatry and injustice renders their fasting ineffective.<p><b>although they may offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them.</b><br>Burnt offerings and grain offerings were central to the sacrificial system in ancient Israel, symbolizing atonement and thanksgiving. However, God rejects these offerings from Judah, highlighting the futility of external religious rituals without true repentance and moral integrity. This echoes the prophetic critique found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a> and <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>, where God expresses disdain for sacrifices devoid of justice and righteousness. The rejection of these offerings underscores the seriousness of Judah's spiritual condition and the need for genuine transformation.<p><b>Instead, I will finish them off by sword and famine and plague.&#8221;</b><br>The triad of sword, famine, and plague represents the comprehensive nature of divine judgment. These calamities were common consequences of covenant unfaithfulness as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The sword signifies warfare and invasion, famine results from drought and siege, and plague often follows in the wake of these disasters. This judgment is a fulfillment of the covenant curses, emphasizing the severity of Judah's rebellion. The phrase also foreshadows the Babylonian conquest and exile, a pivotal event in Israel's history. In a broader theological context, these judgments serve as a warning of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance, while also pointing to the ultimate deliverance and restoration found in Jesus Christ, who bears the curse of sin on behalf of humanity (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

We need not assume that the fast and the sacrifice were necessarily hypocritical, though doubtless much of this mingled itself with the worship of Israel now as it had done in the days of Isaiah, and met with a like rejection (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm" title="And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.">Isaiah 1:15</a>). The lesson here is rather that they came too late to stay the discipline of chastisement.<p><span class= "bld">By the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence,</span>--The history of the world shows how constantly the latter plagues have followed in the wake of the former, and the union of the three has become proverbial (<a href="/context/leviticus/26-25.htm" title="And I will bring a sword on you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when you are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). In <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments on Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the "noisome beast" is added to make up the list of the four sore judgments of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their cry</span>. The word is very forcible; it is the shriek in which an unsophisticated man gives vent to his pain and grief. <span class="cmt_word">An oblation</span>. It is the vegetable offering (Authorized Version, "meat offering;" Luther, "speisopfer") which is referred to in the so-called <span class="accented">minkhah</span> (literally, <span class="accented">gift</span>). Though sometimes offered separately, it regularly accompanied a burnt offering. <span class="cmt_word">I will not accept them</span>. Dr. Payne Smith tries to soften the rejection of these worshippers by the remark that "there is a time when the most genuine repentance avails nothing to avert the temporal consequences of sin." But the analogy of other similar passages (e.g. <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>) warrants the view of Keil that the ground of the rejection of the worship is its heartless formalism and insincerity, which was equally a bar to Jehovah's favor and the prophet's intercession. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Although</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they may fast,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1467;&#1431;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;u&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6684.htm">Strong's 6684: </a> </span><span class="str2">To abstain from food, fast</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1462;&#1444;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;nen&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124;
