Historically, this refers to the time when Judah faced severe drought and impending invasion by Babylon. Mourning in the biblical context often signifies not only physical suffering but also spiritual desolation. The people of Judah are experiencing the consequences of their disobedience to God, as outlined in the covenant curses of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. This mourning can also be seen as a call to repentance, urging the nation to turn back to God.<p><b>and her gates languish.</b><br>The gates of a city in ancient times were central to its life and commerce, serving as places of gathering, judgment, and defense. The languishing of the gates symbolizes the breakdown of societal order and security. It indicates that the city is no longer vibrant or prosperous, reflecting the overall decline of the nation. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a>, where the roads to Zion mourn because no one comes to the appointed festivals. The gates' condition is a physical manifestation of the spiritual and moral decay of the people.<p><b>Her people wail for the land,</b><br>The wailing of the people signifies deep sorrow and desperation. The land, which was a gift from God and a sign of His covenant with Israel, is now suffering due to the people's unfaithfulness. This lamentation is not just for the physical land but also for the loss of God's favor and blessing. The connection to the land is deeply rooted in the identity of the Israelites, as seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>, where God declares the land is His and the people are merely sojourners.<p><b>and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.</b><br>Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah, is now a place of distress. The cry from Jerusalem represents the collective anguish of the nation. This cry can be seen as a plea for divine intervention, reminiscent of the cries of the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23-25</a>). Jerusalem's suffering foreshadows the coming destruction and exile, yet it also points to the hope of restoration, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>, where comfort is promised to God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.

It was the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates.htm">Gates</a></b><br>In ancient cities, gates were not only entry points but also places of gathering, commerce, and legal matters.

Strong, godly leadership is essential for the health and well-being of a society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_despair.htm">Hope in Despair</a></b><br>Even in the midst of mourning and desolation, there is hope.

When they &#8220;languish,&#8221; civic life collapses.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/1-4.htm">Lamentations 1:4</a> echoes this imagery: &#8220;The roads to Zion mourn, for no one comes to her appointed feasts.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The weakening of gates shows how judgment touches every layer&#8212;political, economic, spiritual (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-19.htm">2 Chronicles 36:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It is a picture of defenselessness; without strong gates the people are exposed, fulfilling God&#8217;s warning in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> that enemies would &#8220;rule over&#8221; them when they forsook His statutes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Her people wail for the land</b><p>&#8220;Her people wail for the land&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a>c)<p>&#8226; The land is God&#8217;s covenant gift (<a href="/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>).

Their refusal now results in the cry foretold in <a href="/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17&#8211;19</a>.<p>&#8226; The escalation from local mourning to a city-wide outcry shows that sin&#8217;s impact cannot be contained (<a href="/isaiah/15-3.htm">Isaiah 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, the rising cry hints at hope: God hears the prayers of a humbled city (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/14-2.htm">Jeremiah 14:2</a> paints a four-fold portrait of a covenant people under divine chastening: national grief, collapsed defenses, anguished loss of the promised land, and a desperate cry from the very city that once rejoiced in God. Each phrase exposes the cost of persistent rebellion yet simultaneously opens the door for repentance. The verse calls today&#8217;s reader to heed God&#8217;s warnings, cherish His gifts, and respond swiftly to His convicting voice before grief replaces gladness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The gates thereof languish.</span>--The "gates" of the cities, as the chief places of concourse, like the <span class= "ital">agora </span>of Greek cities, are taken figuratively for the inhabitants, who in the "black" garments of sorrow and with the pallor of the famine, in which all faces gather blackness, are crouching upon the ground in their despair.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The tenses in the following description should be perfects and presents; the Authorized Version, by its inconsistency, destroys the unity of the picture. <span class="cmt_word">The gates thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people assembled there. <span class="cmt_word">They are black unto the ground.</span> "To be black," in Hebrew, is "to be dressed in mourning" (so <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="/psalms/35-14.htm">Psalm 35:14</a>, "I bowed down in black").
