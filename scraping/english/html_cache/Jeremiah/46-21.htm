In ancient times, mercenaries were often employed by nations to bolster their military strength. The imagery of "fattened calves" suggests that these mercenaries are well-fed and pampered, yet ultimately unprepared for the coming conflict. This metaphor implies complacency and impending slaughter, as fattened calves are typically prepared for sacrifice. The use of mercenaries highlights Egypt's reliance on external forces rather than trusting in God, contrasting with Israel's call to depend on divine protection.<p><b>They too will turn back; together they will flee,</b><br>This indicates the mercenaries' lack of loyalty and courage. Despite their initial confidence, they will retreat in the face of danger. Historically, mercenaries were known for their lack of commitment to the cause they were hired to fight for, often fleeing when the battle turned against them. This reflects the broader theme of misplaced trust in human strength and alliances, a recurring issue in the Old Testament where nations often sought help from others instead of relying on God.<p><b>they will not stand their ground,</b><br>The inability to stand firm in battle signifies defeat and failure. This phrase underscores the futility of relying on human power and military might without divine support. In biblical history, standing one's ground was often associated with faithfulness and divine backing, as seen in the stories of David and other faithful leaders. The mercenaries' failure to stand reflects the broader judgment against Egypt for its arrogance and idolatry.<p><b>for the day of calamity is coming upon them&#8212;</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of divine judgment. The "day of calamity" is a common biblical motif representing a time when God enacts justice and punishment on nations for their sins. In the context of Jeremiah, this refers to the impending invasion by Babylon, which God uses as an instrument of judgment against Egypt. The prophetic literature often speaks of such days as inevitable and divinely ordained, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>the time of their punishment.</b><br>The culmination of the prophecy is the punishment that Egypt will face. This punishment is not arbitrary but a response to Egypt's actions, including its pride, idolatry, and oppression of God's people. The concept of divine retribution is central to the prophetic message, where nations are held accountable for their deeds. This serves as a warning to all nations about the consequences of turning away from God's ways, reinforcing the biblical principle that God is just and righteous in His judgments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.
