The "her" refers to Babylon, a symbol of human pride and rebellion against God. This call to battle is part of God's judgment against Babylon for its idolatry and oppression. The preparation for battle signifies the seriousness and inevitability of God's judgment. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the theme of divine retribution found throughout the prophets, where God uses nations as instruments of His justice (<a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4-5</a>).<p><b>the kings of the Medes,</b><br>The Medes were an ancient Iranian people who, along with the Persians, played a crucial role in the downfall of Babylon. Historically, the Medes were known for their military prowess and were part of the coalition that conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This prophecy highlights the specific involvement of the Medes, fulfilling earlier prophecies about Babylon's fall (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>). The mention of the Medes underscores the accuracy of biblical prophecy and God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>their governors and all their officials,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the coalition against Babylon. It wasn't just the kings but also the entire administrative and military leadership that participated in the campaign. This reflects the organized and determined effort to execute God's judgment. The involvement of governors and officials indicates a well-coordinated attack, aligning with historical accounts of the Medo-Persian strategy.<p><b>and all the lands they rule.</b><br>The Medes, along with the Persians, ruled over a vast empire that included many different peoples and territories. This phrase suggests that the judgment against Babylon was not just a local event but involved a wide array of nations under Medo-Persian control. It highlights the far-reaching impact of Babylon's fall and the fulfillment of God's plan on a global scale. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment against all worldly powers opposed to God, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various groups and kingdoms that God is summoning to execute judgment against Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/medes.htm">Medes</a></b><br>An ancient Iranian people who, along with the Persians, played a significant role in the downfall of Babylon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_medes.htm">Kings of the Medes</a></b><br>The rulers of the Median Empire, who were instrumental in the conquest of Babylon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/governors_and_officials.htm">Governors and Officials</a></b><br>The administrative leaders under the kings of the Medes, indicating a well-organized military campaign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lands_they_rule.htm">Lands They Rule</a></b><br>The territories under the control of the Medes, highlighting the extent of their influence and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God orchestrates the rise and fall of nations according to His divine plan.
