The act of putting on sackcloth was a public demonstration of one's sorrow and contrition before God. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>, where the people of Nineveh, including their king, wore sackcloth in response to Jonah's warning of impending judgment. The use of sackcloth signifies a deep awareness of sin and a desire for reconciliation with God.<p><b>mourn and wail</b><br>Mourning and wailing were common expressions of grief and distress in the ancient Near East. These actions were often accompanied by loud cries and lamentations, as seen in the book of Lamentations, which details the sorrow of Jerusalem's destruction. The call to mourn and wail in this context is a response to the impending judgment of God due to the people's persistent sin and rebellion. It reflects a recognition of the seriousness of their situation and the need for genuine repentance.<p><b>for the fierce anger of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "fierce anger of the LORD" underscores the intensity of God's righteous indignation against sin. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is depicted as a response to covenant unfaithfulness and idolatry, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>. This anger is not capricious but is a just response to the people's persistent disobedience. The prophets often warned of God's anger as a means to call the people back to faithfulness and obedience.<p><b>has not turned away from us.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the consequences of the people's sin are imminent and unavoidable unless there is true repentance. The idea of God's anger not turning away is echoed in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>, where repeated warnings are given, yet the people do not return to God. It serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for a heartfelt return to God. Theologically, it points to the necessity of atonement, which Christians believe is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who bore the wrath of God on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
