Historically, after the reign of Solomon, the united kingdom of Israel split into two. The northern kingdom, Israel, was eventually conquered by Assyria in 722 BC, while the southern kingdom, Judah, faced Babylonian conquest in 586 BC. This division is significant as it highlights the persistent disobedience and idolatry that plagued both kingdoms, leading to their eventual downfall.<p><b>have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth;</b><br>The phrase "from their youth" suggests a long history of rebellion and sinfulness, dating back to the early days of the nation. This can be traced back to the wilderness period after the Exodus, where the Israelites frequently disobeyed God (<a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32:1-6</a>). The consistent pattern of idolatry and turning away from God is a central theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing the need for repentance and return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>indeed, they have done nothing but provoke Me to anger</b><br>Provoking God to anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where the Israelites' actions, particularly idolatry and injustice, are seen as direct affronts to God's holiness and covenant relationship. This provocation is not just about breaking laws but about breaking the relational covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The prophets often warned that such behavior would lead to divine judgment, as seen in the eventual exiles of both Israel and Judah.<p><b>by the work of their hands,</b><br>This phrase often refers to the making of idols and the practice of idolatry, which was a significant issue throughout Israel's history. The "work of their hands" implies the creation of physical idols, which were worshipped instead of the one true God. This is condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4-5</a>) and is a central issue addressed by many prophets, including Isaiah and Jeremiah, who warned against the futility and sinfulness of idol worship.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" is a prophetic formula indicating that the message comes directly from God. It underscores the authority and seriousness of the statement. In the context of Jeremiah, it serves as a reminder that the prophet speaks not on his own authority but as a mouthpiece for God, calling the people to repentance and warning of impending judgment if they continue in their ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem during a time of great turmoil and impending exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_israel_and_judah.htm">Sons of Israel and Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the people of the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah), who were often in rebellion against God, leading to their eventual exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful, calling His people to repentance and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant as the center of worship and the location of the Temple, yet also a place of idolatry and rebellion during Jeremiah's time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The impending punishment for the persistent disobedience and idolatry of the people, leading to their captivity in Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_sin.htm">The Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just an action but a condition of the heart that leads to rebellion against God.
