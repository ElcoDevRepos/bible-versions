In the ancient Near Eastern context, lying down in shame signifies a deep sense of remorse and humility. It is an act of contrition, recognizing one's wrongdoing before God. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where physical posture is used to express inner spiritual realities, such as sackcloth and ashes in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a> or the prostration of worship in <a href="/revelation/7-11.htm">Revelation 7:11</a>.<p><b>let our disgrace cover us.</b><br>The concept of disgrace covering an individual or a community is a vivid depiction of the consequences of sin. In biblical terms, disgrace often results from covenant unfaithfulness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience leads to becoming a byword among nations. This phrase underscores the seriousness of Israel's spiritual adultery and the need for divine forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>We have sinned against the LORD our God,</b><br>This confession acknowledges the breach of the covenant relationship with Yahweh. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) emphasizes the personal and covenantal nature of God, who had delivered Israel from Egypt and given them the Law. The acknowledgment of sin against God is a central theme in the prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a>, where Daniel confesses the sins of the nation. It highlights the need for repentance and the hope of redemption.<p><b>both we and our fathers;</b><br>This phrase indicates a recognition of generational sin, acknowledging that the current generation is not only responsible for their own sins but also part of a legacy of disobedience. This concept is echoed in passages like <a href="/nehemiah/9-16.htm">Nehemiah 9:16-17</a>, where the sins of the ancestors are recounted as part of a communal confession. It reflects the biblical understanding of corporate identity and responsibility.<p><b>from our youth even to this day</b><br>This expression suggests a long-standing pattern of disobedience, emphasizing the persistent nature of Israel's rebellion. It recalls the history of Israel's relationship with God, from the time of the Exodus to the present moment of Jeremiah's prophecy. This continuity of sin is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>, where the cycle of disobedience and deliverance is described.<p><b>we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.&#8221;</b><br>The failure to obey God's voice is a central issue in the prophetic critique of Israel. The "voice of the LORD" refers to the divine commandments and guidance given through the Law and the prophets. This disobedience is contrasted with the ideal of hearing and obeying God's word, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience. The phrase underscores the need for a return to faithfulness and the hope of restoration through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
