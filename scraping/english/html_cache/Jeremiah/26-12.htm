This phrase highlights his boldness and obedience to God, speaking directly to those in authority. The officials and people represent the entire spectrum of society, indicating the widespread nature of the message. Jeremiah's audience included priests, prophets, and the general populace, reflecting the comprehensive reach of his prophetic ministry.<p><b>&#8220;The LORD sent me</b><br>Jeremiah emphasizes his divine commission, underscoring that his message is not of human origin but from God. This assertion of divine authority is crucial, as it legitimizes his message and mission. The phrase reflects the prophetic tradition where prophets are sent by God to deliver His messages, as seen in the call narratives of other prophets like Isaiah (Isaiah 6) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 2-3).<p><b>to prophesy against this house and against this city</b><br>The "house" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, and the "city" is Jerusalem itself. Jeremiah's prophecy is one of judgment, warning of impending destruction due to the people's unfaithfulness. This echoes earlier warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience. The focus on the Temple and city highlights the centrality of Jerusalem in Jewish religious and national identity.<p><b>all the words that you have heard</b><br>Jeremiah's message was not new; it was consistent with previous warnings he had delivered. This phrase indicates that the people were already familiar with the content of his prophecies, which included calls for repentance and warnings of judgment. The repetition of the message underscores the seriousness of the situation and the people's persistent refusal to heed God's warnings. This aligns with the pattern of prophetic ministry where messages are often repeated to emphasize their importance and urgency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
