This command signifies the importance of preserving God's words for future generations. The act of writing on a scroll indicates the permanence and authority of the message. Scrolls were typically made from papyrus or parchment, materials that were durable and suitable for long-term storage.<p><b>all the words I have spoken to you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message. Jeremiah is instructed to record not his own thoughts, but the words given by God. This underscores the prophetic role of Jeremiah as a mouthpiece for God, ensuring that the message is not altered or lost over time. It highlights the comprehensive nature of God's communication with His prophet.<p><b>concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations</b><br>The scope of the message is broad, addressing not only the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah but also the surrounding nations. This reflects the universal sovereignty of God and His concern for all peoples. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of the gospel being for all nations, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>from the day I first spoke to you during the reign of Josiah</b><br>Jeremiah's prophetic ministry began during the reign of King Josiah, a time of significant religious reform in Judah (2 Kings 22-23). Josiah's efforts to restore true worship provide a backdrop for Jeremiah's messages, which often called the people back to covenant faithfulness. This historical context highlights the continuity of God's message through different periods and leaders.<p><b>until today</b><br>This phrase indicates the ongoing nature of God's revelation to Jeremiah. It suggests that the messages were not isolated incidents but part of a continuous dialogue between God and His prophet. This ongoing communication reflects God's persistent call to repentance and His desire for His people to return to Him. It also underscores the immediacy and relevance of the prophetic word for the present moment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

Our calling is to receive the entire message, trust its accuracy, and let it shape our lives today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Take thee a roll of a book.</span>--The same phrase meets us in <a href="/psalms/40-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,">Psalm 40:7</a> (ascribed by some critics to Jeremiah), but does not occur in any earlier prophet or historical book. It is found in later prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm" title="And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;">Ezekiel 2:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1</a>; <a href="/context/zechariah/5-1.htm" title="Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.">Zechariah 5:1-2</a>). It probably followed on the introduction of parchment as a material for writing on, and the consequent substitution of the roll for the papyrus books, for which, from their fragile fabric, a different form was necessary. The command thus given to Baruch is interesting as letting us, so to speak, into the "workshop" of the prophet. He speaks probably without premeditation, as the word of the Lord comes to him (<a href="/matthew/10-19.htm" title="But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.">Matthew 10:19</a>). A disciple acts as reporter, and preserves the utterance in writing. It is interesting in this respect to note the parallelism between Jeremiah's <span class= "ital">modus operandi </span>and St. Paul's (<a href="/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>). From time to time the prophet collects, repeats, revises, and, in modern phrase, edits what he has uttered. We have here accordingly what may be described as the history of the first volume of his discourses--a volume which perished, as the chapter records, but of which the earlier chapters of the present book are substantially a reproduction. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a scroll</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7713;il&#183;la&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4039.htm">Strong's 4039: </a> </span><span class="str2">A scroll</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and write</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#7687;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
