A "day of fasting" indicates a time of national repentance and seeking God, often in response to crisis or sin. Fasting was a common practice in ancient Israel, signifying humility and dependence on God. This setting underscores the seriousness of the message to be delivered, as fasting days were times when the people were more attuned to spiritual matters.<p><b>and in the hearing of the people</b><br>The public reading of Scripture was a common practice in ancient Israel, ensuring that God's word was accessible to all, including those who were illiterate. This phrase emphasizes the communal aspect of receiving God's message, highlighting the importance of corporate accountability and response to divine instruction.<p><b>you are to read the words of the LORD from the scroll you have written at my dictation</b><br>The scroll represents the written word of God, dictated by Jeremiah to his scribe Baruch. This process underscores the divine inspiration of Scripture, as the words are not Jeremiah's own but those of the LORD. The act of reading from the scroll signifies the authority and permanence of God's message, contrasting with the oral traditions that could be more easily altered or forgotten.<p><b>Read them in the hearing of all the people of Judah who are coming from their cities</b><br>This phrase indicates the widespread nature of the message, intended for all of Judah, not just those residing in Jerusalem. The gathering of people from various cities suggests a significant occasion, likely a major festival or a special assembly. This broad audience reflects the universal call to repentance and the inclusive nature of God's covenant with His people.

And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.">1Kings 21:10</a>), and it was accordingly a time when the courts of the Temple would be more than usually thronged, and when, it might be hoped, the people gathered in them would be more than usually disposed to listen to warnings and exhortations to repentance. Probably, however, the king had proclaimed the fast by the advice of the priests and false prophets, to rouse the people to the "holy war" of an enthusiastic religious resistance to the Chaldeans, and this may account for the eagerness of Jeremiah to counteract the scheme by the unlooked-for sermon. The addition, "and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah," implies that Baruch was, if opportunity offered, to read the words of the prophecy on other occasions and to other gatherings of the people. The ordinary fast of the Day of Atonement was, it will be remembered, in the seventh month--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>October; this accordingly was in November or December. This agrees, it may be noted, with the charcoal fire which was burning in the king's chamber (<a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm" title="Now the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.">Jeremiah 36:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/36.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the fasting day</span>.
