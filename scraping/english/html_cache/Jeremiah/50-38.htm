The drying up of waters symbolizes both literal and metaphorical desolation. Historically, Babylon was situated near the Euphrates River, which was crucial for its agriculture and trade. The prophecy of drought indicates a divine intervention that disrupts the natural order, reflecting God's sovereignty over creation. This imagery of water drying up is reminiscent of God's judgment in other scriptures, such as the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-21.htm">Exodus 7:21</a>) and the drying of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). It also foreshadows the fall of Babylon, as seen in <a href="/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>, where the Euphrates is dried up to prepare the way for kings from the East.<p><b>For it is a land of graven images,</b><br>Babylon was notorious for its idolatry, with numerous temples and statues dedicated to various deities. The term "graven images" refers to carved idols, which were central to Babylonian worship and culture. This idolatry is a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), highlighting the spiritual corruption of the nation. The prevalence of idols in Babylon is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing the futility and deception of worshipping man-made objects (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The judgment upon Babylon serves as a warning against idolatry, a sin that leads to spiritual blindness and separation from God.<p><b>and the people go mad over idols.</b><br>The phrase "go mad" suggests a frenzied, irrational devotion to idols, indicating a deep spiritual delusion. This madness can be understood as a form of divine judgment, where God gives people over to their sinful desires (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-25</a>). The worship of idols leads to moral and spiritual decay, as seen in the history of Israel and other nations. The madness over idols contrasts with the peace and wisdom found in worshipping the one true God. This serves as a reminder of the dangers of idolatry, which can consume individuals and societies, leading them away from truth and righteousness. The ultimate fulfillment of this judgment is seen in the fall of Babylon, both historically and eschatologically, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and other nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A powerful empire known for its wealth and idolatry, Babylon is the subject of God's judgment in this passage.

Saying, &#8220;A drought is upon her waters&#8221; announces that the very lifeline of the nation will fail.<p>- God has done this before: &#8220;I say to the deep, &#8216;Be dry,&#8217; and I will dry up your rivers&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a>).<p>- The prophecy was literally fulfilled when the Persians diverted the Euphrates, leaving Babylon vulnerable (<a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>).<p>- This divine drying points to the Lord&#8217;s absolute sovereignty over creation (<a href="/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>) and His willingness to upend the natural order to judge sin (<a href="/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they will be dried up</b><p>- The repetition underscores certainty. God is not merely threatening; He is declaring a completed fact (<a href="/jeremiah/51-36.htm">Jeremiah 51:36</a>).<p>- When He speaks, nature obeys&#8212;whether it is the Red Sea parting (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>) or a fig tree withering at Christ&#8217;s word (<a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19-20</a>).<p>- The complete dryness illustrates total judgment: no half-measures, no lingering life-support for a corrupt system (<a href="/revelation/18-21.htm">Revelation 18:21</a>).<p>- What sustains Babylon today can be gone tomorrow, reminding us that every earthly security is temporary (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For it is a land of graven images</b><p>- God immediately states the reason: rampant idolatry. Babylon&#8217;s famed temples&#8212;Marduk&#8217;s ziggurat, Ishtar&#8217;s shrines&#8212;saturated the culture with carved gods (<a href="/jeremiah/51-47.htm">Jeremiah 51:47</a>).<p>- The first two commandments still stand: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8230; You shall not make for yourself an idol&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>).<p>- Idolatry always provokes God&#8217;s jealousy because it exchanges His glory for lifeless substitutes (<a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>).<p>- The Lord&#8217;s judgments consistently expose idols as helpless: Dagon falls before the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-3.htm">1 Samuel 5:3-4</a>); Bel bows in the dust (<a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the people go mad over idols</b><p>- Babylon&#8217;s citizens were not casually interested; they were obsessed. The phrase paints frenzy and irrational devotion.<p>- Similar madness appears in Israel&#8217;s golden-calf episode, where &#8220;the people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>).<p>- Idolatry intoxicates: &#8220;They consult a piece of wood&#8230; a spirit of prostitution leads them astray&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>).<p>- Spiritual insanity results: trusting things that cannot speak, see, or save (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>) while rejecting the living God (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>- The New Testament warns believers against the same pull&#8212;greed, pleasure, power&#8212;calling it &#8220;idolatry&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/50-38.htm">Jeremiah 50:38</a> pronounces a literal, unstoppable drought on Babylon&#8217;s water supply, signaling God&#8217;s judgment on a culture consumed by idols. The drying of the rivers foreshadows the collapse of every human system that defies the Lord. Babylon&#8217;s downfall reminds us that God alone is worthy of worship, that idols&#8212;ancient or modern&#8212;lead to spiritual madness, and that turning from them to the living God is the only path to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">A drought is upon her waters.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">A sword. </span>The Hebrew word for "drought" has the same consonants as that for "sword," with different vowel-points. In the original text the form of the two words must have been identical, as the vowel-points were of later introduction. The editors of the present text were probably guided by the thought that the context in this case determined the meaning of the word as meaning "drought," and not a "sword." So in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-22.htm" title="The LORD shall smite you with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you until you perish.">Deuteronomy 28:22</a> the text of the Authorised version gives "sword," and the margin "drought." There is, however, a certain loss of rhetorical emphasis in the change of the word with which the three previous verses had begun. The "waters" include the canals of Babylon as well as the Euphrates.<p><span class= "bld">They are mad upon their idols.</span>--The word for "idols" means literally "terrors," or "objects of terror," as in <a href="/psalms/88-16.htm" title="Your fierce wrath goes over me; your terrors have cut me off.">Psalm 88:16</a>; <a href="/job/20-25.htm" title="It is drawn, and comes out of the body; yes, the glittering sword comes out of his gall: terrors are on him.">Job 20:25</a>, and this is the only place in which it is used of the objects of worship. In <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/2-10.htm" title="The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;">Deuteronomy 2:10-11</a> it appears as the name of the Emim, probably as meaning "the terrible, <span class= "ital">or </span>gigantic ones." Here it seems used for the colossal figures--winged bulls, human-headed lions, and the like--which were the objects of Babylonian worship. (See note on <a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm" title="Your terribleness has deceived you, and the pride of your heart, O you that dwell in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:16</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A drought.</span> The Maasoretic critics, in their prosaic realism, were unable to see how a "sword" could be "upon the waters;" hence they altered <span class="accented">khereb</span> into <span class="accented">khoreb.</span> But the sword is merely a symbol of the Divine vengeance, and may be interpreted differently according to the exigencies of the context.
