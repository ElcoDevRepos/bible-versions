The rhetorical question emphasizes that the sword of the LORD, representing His judgment, cannot be at peace or inactive because it is under divine command. This highlights the sovereignty of God in executing His will. The context is a prophecy against the Philistines, a frequent adversary of Israel. The LORD's command signifies His direct involvement in the affairs of nations, underscoring His ultimate authority over history. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word accomplishes what He desires.<p><b>He has appointed it against Ashkelon</b><br>Ashkelon was one of the five major Philistine cities, located along the Mediterranean coast. It was a significant center of trade and military power. The appointment of judgment against Ashkelon signifies a targeted divine action against a specific location known for its opposition to Israel. Historically, Ashkelon was a fortified city, and its mention here indicates the comprehensive nature of the coming judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s judgment against nations that oppose His people, as seen in <a href="/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>, where the Philistines are also condemned.<p><b>and the shore of its coastland.</b><br>The reference to the "shore of its coastland" expands the scope of the prophecy to include the entire Philistine territory along the Mediterranean. This geographical detail underscores the thoroughness of the impending judgment. The coastland was vital for trade and cultural exchange, making it a strategic area. The destruction of the coastland would signify not only military defeat but also economic and cultural collapse. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God&#8217;s judgment extending to all areas of life, as seen in <a href="/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4-7</a>, where the Philistine cities are prophesied to become desolate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashkelon.htm">Ashkelon</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities located on the Mediterranean coast, often a symbol of the enemies of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who commands and orchestrates events according to His divine will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seacoast.htm">The Seacoast</a></b><br>Refers to the coastal regions of Philistia, indicating the broader area targeted by God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>An ancient people who were often in conflict with Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's command over nations and events is absolute.
