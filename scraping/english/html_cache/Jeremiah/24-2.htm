Early-ripening figs were considered a delicacy in ancient Israel, representing the first fruits of the harvest and thus a sign of God's favor. This phrase suggests a remnant of people who are faithful and obedient to God, akin to the good figs. In the broader context of Jeremiah, these figs symbolize the exiles in Babylon who will eventually be restored. The early ripening indicates readiness and a special quality, pointing to those who are spiritually prepared and responsive to God's call.<p><b>but the other basket contained very poor figs</b><br>The poor figs represent those who are rebellious and unrepentant, specifically the people who remained in Jerusalem and those who fled to Egypt, as described later in the chapter. These figs are a metaphor for spiritual decay and moral corruption. In the cultural context, poor figs would be considered worthless and unusable, highlighting the severity of the people's spiritual condition. This imagery serves as a warning of judgment for those who do not follow God's ways.<p><b>so bad they could not be eaten</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete rejection and worthlessness of the bad figs. In the prophetic context, it underscores the inevitable judgment and destruction that will come upon those who are disobedient. The inedibility of the figs signifies the total depravity and hopelessness of those who have turned away from God. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that speak of the consequences of sin and rebellion, such as the parable of the barren fig tree in <a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>, which also warns of judgment for unfruitfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
