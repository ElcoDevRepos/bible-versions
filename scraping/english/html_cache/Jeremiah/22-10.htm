The instruction not to weep for him suggests that his death, though tragic, was honorable and he is at peace. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, mourning for the dead was a significant ritual, but here, the focus is shifted away from traditional mourning practices. Josiah's death marked the end of an era of reform and righteousness, yet his fate is seen as preferable to the judgment awaiting those who remain.<p><b>Weep bitterly for him who is exiled,</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, Josiah's son, who was taken captive to Egypt by Pharaoh Necho II. The emphasis on weeping for the exiled highlights the severity of exile compared to death. In the ancient Near Eastern context, exile was considered a fate worse than death because it involved separation from one's homeland, people, and God. Theologically, this exile represents the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant.<p><b>for he will never return to see his native land.</b><br>This phrase underscores the finality of Jehoahaz's situation. Unlike death, which offers a form of closure, exile is portrayed as a living death, a perpetual state of loss and separation. The historical context here is significant, as Jehoahaz's removal from Judah symbolizes the beginning of the end for the nation, leading to the Babylonian exile. This also serves as a prophetic warning to the people of Judah about the consequences of their continued disobedience. Theologically, it reflects the theme of divine judgment and the hope of eventual restoration, as seen in other prophetic writings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Though naturally mourned (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24&#8211;25</a>), Josiah&#8217;s earthly end was, in God&#8217;s eyes, rest and relief: &#8220;The righteous man is taken away from evil&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Death is not defeat for those who belong to the Lord (<a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13&#8211;14</a>).

Physical death of the faithful is a temporary sorrow eased by eternal hope; ongoing life under God&#8217;s judgment is a tragedy demanding bitter tears. The verse calls believers to grieve most for those estranged from the Lord and to heed the warning that dwelling in unrepentant rebellion leads to irreversible loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Weep ye not for the dead.</span>--With this verse begins the detailed review of the three previous reigns, the prophecies being reproduced as they were actually delivered. The "dead" for whom men are not to weep is Josiah, for whom Jeremiah had himself composed a solemn dirge, which seems from <a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2Chronicles 35:25</a> to have been repeated on the anniversary of his death.<p><span class= "bld">For him that goeth away.</span>--This is obviously Jehoahaz, the son and successor of Josiah, who was deposed by Pharaoh-nechoh, and carried into Egypt (<a href="/context/2_kings/23-31.htm" title="Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.">2Kings 23:31-34</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/36-2.htm" title="Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:2-4</a>). The latter passage shows that he was younger than his successor, Jehoiakim, by two years. The doom of the exile who was to return no more was a fitter subject for lamentation than the death of the righteous king who died a warrior's death (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm" title="In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.">2Kings 23:29</a>), and was thus "taken away from the evil to come."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - There is a fate worse than that of the dead Josiah. <span class="cmt_word">Weep not</span>, in comparison, for him, but <span class="cmt_word">weep sore for him that goeth away</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">that is gone away</span>). The king referred to is probably Jehoahaz, who, though two years younger than Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; comp. 36), was preferred to him by the people on the death of Josiah. The counsel to "weep sore" for this royal exile was carried out, as Mr. Samuel Cox observes (and we have, perhaps, a specimen of the popular elegies upon him in <a href="/ezekiel/19-1.htm">Ezekiel 19:1-4</a>): "A young lion of royal strain, caught untimely, and chained and carried away captive, - this was how the people of Israel conceived of Shallum" ('Biblical Expositions,' p. 120). The conjecture is incapable of proof; and Ezekiel, we know, was fond of imaginative elegies. But probably enough he was in harmony with popular feeling on this occasion. The identification of Shallum with Jehoahaz is confirmed by <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> (Shallum, the youngest son of Josiah); the name appears to have been changed on his accession to the throne, just as Eliakim was changed to Jehoiakim (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>). There is, therefore, no occasion to suppose an ironical allusion to the short reign of Jehoahaz, which might be compared to that of the Israelitish king Shallum (somewhat as Jezebel addresses Jehu as "O Zimri, murderer of his lord," <a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>). This view has the support of F. Junius (professor at Leyden, 1592), of Graf, and Rowland Williams; but why should not the Chronicler, though writing in the Persian period, have drawn here, as well as elsewhere in the genealogies, from ancient traditional sources? There is nothing in ver. 11 to suggest an allusion to the fate of the earlier Shallum. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">weep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#7687;&#183;k&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1058.htm">Strong's 1058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To weep, to bemoan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the dead [king];</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;m&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
