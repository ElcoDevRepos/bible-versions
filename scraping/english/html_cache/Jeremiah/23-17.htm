In the historical context of Jeremiah, many Israelites had turned away from God, embracing idolatry and injustice. The false prophets assured these individuals of peace, contradicting God's true message delivered through Jeremiah. This reflects a broader biblical theme where false assurances are given to those living in rebellion against God (see <a href="/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>). The term "despise" indicates a deep-seated rejection of God's authority and commandments, a recurring issue in Israel's history.<p><b>&#8216;The LORD says that you will have peace,&#8217;</b><br>The false prophets claimed divine authority by saying "The LORD says," which was a grave misuse of God's name. In the cultural context, invoking God's name was meant to lend credibility and weight to a message. However, these prophets were misleading the people, promising peace when God had decreed judgment due to their sins. This false assurance of peace is reminiscent of the deceptive messages in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where people are lulled into a false sense of security before sudden destruction.<p><b>and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart</b><br>This phrase describes those who follow their own desires rather than God's will. The "stubbornness of heart" is a biblical motif indicating rebellion and self-will, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-19.htm">Deuteronomy 29:19</a>. In Jeremiah's time, this stubbornness manifested in the people's refusal to heed God's warnings through His prophets. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of will and decision-making, and a stubborn heart is resistant to divine guidance.<p><b>&#8216;No harm will come to you.&#8217;</b><br>The false prophets' message of "No harm will come to you" directly contradicted the warnings of impending judgment due to the people's sins. This assurance was a dangerous lie, as it encouraged complacency and continued disobedience. Historically, this false sense of security led to the Babylonian exile, fulfilling God's warnings through Jeremiah. This phrase serves as a caution against ignoring God's true messages and relying on comforting lies, a theme echoed in the New Testament warnings against false teachers (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who claimed to speak for God but delivered messages contrary to His will, often offering false assurances of peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, who were often led astray by false prophets and their own stubbornness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is being misrepresented by the false prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stubbornness_of_heart.htm">Stubbornness of Heart</a></b><br>A phrase indicating the willful disobedience and self-reliance of the people, rejecting God's true message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Believers must be cautious of leaders who offer comforting messages that contradict God's truth.
