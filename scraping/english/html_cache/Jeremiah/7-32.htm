It signals an impending event that is certain to occur, as it is spoken by the LORD. This phrase is often used to emphasize the certainty and divine origin of the prophecy. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over time and history, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Ben-hinnom</b><br>Topheth and the Valley of Ben-hinnom were locations associated with idolatrous practices, including child sacrifice to the god Molech, as mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5-6</a>. The renaming signifies a transformation of the place's identity due to the judgment that will occur there. The Valley of Ben-hinnom, located south of Jerusalem, later became associated with Gehenna, a term used in the New Testament to describe hell, symbolizing ultimate judgment and destruction.<p><b>but the Valley of Slaughter</b><br>This new name, the Valley of Slaughter, indicates the severe judgment that will befall the area. It reflects the consequences of the people's sins and the resulting divine retribution. The imagery of slaughter underscores the seriousness of the judgment and serves as a warning to the people of Judah. This transformation from a place of idolatry to a site of judgment is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, highlighting the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>For they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room</b><br>This phrase describes the extent of the coming devastation. The imagery of overflowing graves signifies the magnitude of the judgment and the inability of the land to contain the dead. It serves as a stark warning of the consequences of persistent disobedience and idolatry. This prophecy is fulfilled in the historical context of the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17-20</a>. The overflowing graves also echo the imagery of judgment found in Revelation, where the finality of God's judgment is depicted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

It emphasizes the seriousness with which God views disobedience and the certainty of His justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Jeremiah's warning is ultimately a call to repentance.
