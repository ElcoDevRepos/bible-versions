It reflects the king's recognition of Jeremiah's prophetic role and possibly his respect for Jeremiah's God. Historically, it shows the influence Jeremiah had, even among foreign leaders. This command is significant as it demonstrates God's protection over His prophet, fulfilling earlier promises of deliverance (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>).<p><b>Look after him</b><br>The instruction to care for Jeremiah highlights the divine favor upon him, even in the midst of Jerusalem's destruction. It underscores God's sovereignty in using even foreign powers to accomplish His purposes. This care contrasts with the suffering of Jerusalem's inhabitants, emphasizing Jeremiah's unique role and God's faithfulness to His servants.<p><b>And do not let any harm come to him</b><br>This phrase assures Jeremiah's safety amidst the chaos of the Babylonian conquest. It reflects God's promise to protect Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20-21</a>). Theologically, it illustrates God's providence and the fulfillment of His word, as well as the theme of divine protection for those who are faithful to God's calling.<p><b>Do for him whatever he says</b><br>This command grants Jeremiah a level of authority and freedom, showing the high regard in which he was held by Nebuchadnezzar. It also indicates the fulfillment of God's promise to give Jeremiah favor in the eyes of others (<a href="/jeremiah/39-11.htm">Jeremiah 39:11-14</a>). This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ, who also found favor with both God and man (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>), and whose words carry authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who warned Judah of impending judgment and was often persecuted for his messages.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who conquered Jerusalem and issued the command to protect Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuzaradan.htm">Nebuzaradan</a></b><br>The captain of the guard under Nebuchadnezzar, tasked with ensuring Jeremiah's safety.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that conquered Judah and Jerusalem, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecies of judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city under siege and eventual conquest by Babylon, marking a pivotal moment in Judah's history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>God's protection is evident in Jeremiah's life, reminding us that He is sovereign over all circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Jeremiah's steadfastness in delivering God's message, despite opposition, encourages us to remain faithful in our own trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The command from Nebuchadnezzar to protect Jeremiah demonstrates God's control over nations and leaders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/favor_in_unlikely_places.htm">Favor in Unlikely Places</a></b><br>Just as Jeremiah found favor in Babylon, we can trust God to provide for us in unexpected ways and places.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_call.htm">Obedience to God's Call</a></b><br>Jeremiah's life exemplifies the importance of obedience to God's call, regardless of the challenges we face.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_39_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 39:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_39_12_God_s_protection_proof.htm">How does Jeremiah 39:12 demonstrate God's protection over His faithful servants?
