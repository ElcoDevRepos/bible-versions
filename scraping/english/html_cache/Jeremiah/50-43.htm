Historically, Babylon was a dominant empire, and its king was a powerful figure. The report likely pertains to the advancing armies of the Medes and Persians, as prophesied by Jeremiah. This echoes the theme of divine judgment against nations that oppose God's will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>, where Babylon's fall is foretold. The king's reaction underscores the fulfillment of God's prophecy and the certainty of His plans.<p><b>and his hands hang limp</b><br>The imagery of limp hands signifies helplessness and fear. In ancient Near Eastern culture, strong hands symbolized power and control, so limp hands indicate a loss of strength and authority. This reflects the king's inability to defend his kingdom against God's judgment. Similar imagery is found in <a href="/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a>, where hands grow weak in the face of divine wrath. It serves as a reminder of human frailty before God's sovereign power.<p><b>Anguish has gripped him</b><br>The term "anguish" conveys intense emotional and physical distress. This reaction is significant, as Babylon was known for its might and confidence. The king's anguish highlights the reversal of fortunes when God intervenes. This mirrors the fear and despair experienced by other rulers in the Bible when confronted with divine judgment, such as Pharaoh during the plagues in <a href="/exodus/10-7.htm">Exodus 10:7</a>. It emphasizes the theme of God's ultimate authority over earthly powers.<p><b>pain like that of a woman in labor</b><br>This simile is a common biblical metaphor for extreme distress and inevitable suffering. Labor pains are intense and unavoidable, symbolizing the inescapable nature of Babylon's downfall. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, to describe sudden and overwhelming calamity. It also foreshadows the birth of a new era, as Babylon's fall paves the way for the rise of other nations and the eventual coming of Christ, who brings ultimate deliverance and hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>Represents the ruler of the Babylonian Empire, a powerful and dominant force in the ancient Near East.
