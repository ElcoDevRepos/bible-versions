These dreams were often self-serving and misleading, not aligned with God's true message. The cultural context of the ancient Near East placed significant value on dreams as a means of divine communication, but this was often exploited by false prophets. The Bible frequently warns against false prophets (<a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a>, <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>), emphasizing the need for discernment. This phrase suggests that while dreams can be shared, they must be weighed against the truth of God's word.<p><b>but let him who has My word speak it truthfully</b><br>This emphasizes the importance of fidelity to God's message. In contrast to the false prophets, Jeremiah was called to deliver God's word accurately, regardless of personal cost or public reception. The historical context shows that true prophets often faced persecution (<a href="/jeremiah/20.htm">Jeremiah 20:1-2</a>, <a href="/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>). The call to speak truthfully aligns with the broader biblical theme of truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>) and the responsibility of those who are entrusted with God's word (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>For what is straw compared to grain?&#8221;</b><br>This metaphor contrasts the emptiness of false prophecies (straw) with the nourishing and sustaining truth of God's word (grain). Straw, while part of the harvest, is ultimately useless for sustenance, symbolizing the empty promises of false prophets. Grain, on the other hand, represents the life-giving and sustaining power of God's word (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>). This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that use agricultural metaphors to distinguish between true and false teachings (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. Throughout the Bible, when God declares something, it is a statement of divine authority and truth (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). The use of "declares the LORD" serves as a reminder that the message comes from God Himself, not from human invention or interpretation. This reinforces the call to heed God's word above all else, as His declarations are trustworthy and eternal (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Like straw versus grain, only the pure Word possesses substance, nourishment, and eternal worth. Believers are called to prize, proclaim, and live by that unfailing Word, testing every message against it and finding their spiritual sustenance in its truth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Let him tell a dream.</span>--The point of the words lies in the contrast between the real and the counterfeit revelation.

Jeremiah, then, does not deny that there is a measure of truth in what these prophets say; he only demands a distinct declaration that their dreams are but dreams, and not equal in authority to the Divine word. For, as he continues, <span class="cmt_word">What is the chaff to the wheat</span>? What right have you to mix the worthless chaff with the pure, winnowed grain? How, he implies, can such an adulterated message produce the designed effect of a prophetic revelation? (St. Paul has a somewhat similar figure, <a href="/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-13</a>.) So Naegelsbach. Keil, however, denies that there is any thought of an adulteration of the Divine word by the "false prophets." According to him, the question in this verse is simply meant to emphasize the contrast between the false, dream-born prophecy of Jeremiah's opponents and the true revelations. How can the false prophecy pretend to be the true? They are as different as chaff and wheat. Both views are admissible. Naegelsbach introduces a new element by suggesting the intermixture of false and true in the utterances of the "false prophets;" but his view is not inconsistent with what the prophet has stated before, and it is favored by ver. 30 and by the command, <span class="cmt_word">Let him speak my word faithfully</span>;
