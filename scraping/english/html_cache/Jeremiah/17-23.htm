Throughout the book of Jeremiah, God repeatedly calls His people to repentance, but they refuse to heed His warnings. This reflects a pattern seen throughout the Old Testament, where Israel often turns away from God despite His continuous guidance and provision (e.g., <a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>). The refusal to listen is a sign of spiritual rebellion and a hardened heart.<p><b>or incline their ear</b><br>The imagery of inclining the ear suggests an active effort to understand and obey. In ancient Near Eastern culture, listening was not merely hearing words but involved a commitment to act upon them. The failure to incline their ear indicates a deliberate choice to ignore God's commands, similar to the behavior of the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>).<p><b>but they stiffened their necks</b><br>This metaphor of a stiff neck is often used in the Bible to describe obstinacy and resistance to divine authority (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). It evokes the image of an animal that refuses to be guided by its master. In a spiritual sense, it signifies a refusal to submit to God's will, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature.<p><b>and would not listen</b><br>The repetition of their refusal to listen emphasizes the depth of their rebellion. It underscores the seriousness of their sin and the reason for the impending judgment. This echoes the warnings given by other prophets, such as Isaiah, who also spoke of the people's unwillingness to hear God's word (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>).<p><b>or receive My discipline</b><br>Discipline here refers to God's corrective measures intended to bring His people back to righteousness. The refusal to accept discipline is a rejection of God's love and care, as discipline is a sign of His fatherly concern (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-6</a>). This rejection ultimately leads to the consequences of their actions, as seen in the Babylonian exile. The call to receive discipline is also a call to repentance and restoration, which is a central message of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The very next words expose Judah&#8217;s response: &#8220;Yet they would not listen.&#8221;<p>&#8226;To &#8220;listen&#8221; in Scripture is not passive; it means hearing with the intent to obey (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226;Jeremiah earlier lamented, &#8220;Yet they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>).<p>&#8226;The pattern stretches back generations: &#8220;The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them again and again&#8230; but they mocked God&#8217;s messengers&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>).<p>Refusal to listen is the first step toward every subsequent act of rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor incline their ear</b><p>&#8220;Inclining the ear&#8221; pictures a deliberate leaning in, a posture of eagerness.<p>&#8226;God pleads, &#8220;Incline your ear and come to Me; listen, that your soul may live&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>).<p>&#8226;When the prophets rose early to speak, the people &#8220;did not incline their ear to listen&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-14.htm">Jeremiah 34:14</a>).<p>Ignoring God is therefore not accidental; it is a conscious choice to stay unmoved by His voice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they stiffened their necks</b><p>The imagery shifts from hearing to posture. A stiff neck belongs to an ox that refuses the yoke.<p>&#8226;In the wilderness God said, &#8220;I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>).<p>&#8226;Stephen echoed the charge: &#8220;You stiff-necked people&#8230; you always resist the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>Stiff-necked hearts resist God&#8217;s rightful claim of lordship, preferring self-rule to humble submission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Would not listen</b><p>The phrase repeats, driving home the willful pattern.<p>&#8226;&#8220;Yet they did not listen or turn their ear, but walked in the stubbornness of their hearts&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/11-8.htm">Jeremiah 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226;Repetition signals that the issue is not lack of information; it is hardened wills.

Judah treats it as an intrusion instead of mercy.<p>&#8226;Jeremiah cries, &#8220;O LORD, You struck them, but they felt no pain; You crushed them, but they refused correction&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Zephaniah says, &#8220;She heeded no voice, she accepted no correction&#8221; (<a href="/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2</a>).<p>Rejecting discipline leaves only judgment, because God will not perpetually endure contempt for His holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/17-23.htm">Jeremiah 17:23</a> lays out a tragic chain: refusal to listen, unwillingness to lean in, stubborn resistance, repeated deafness, and rejection of loving correction.
