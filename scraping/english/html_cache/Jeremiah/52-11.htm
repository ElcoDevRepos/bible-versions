This journey to Babylon marks the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>) about the fall of Jerusalem and the exile of its people. It also represents the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity, a pivotal event in Jewish history.<p><b>where he kept him in custody until his dying day</b><br>Zedekiah's life in Babylon was one of imprisonment, reflecting the consequences of his rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar and, more importantly, against God.

The detail is literal history and also heightens the tragedy of sin&#8217;s consequences.<p>&#8226; God had warned Zedekiah through Jeremiah that he would &#8220;see the king of Babylon&#8230; yet he will die there&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4-5</a>). Ezekiel added that although Zedekiah would be taken to Babylon, he would not &#8220;see it&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>). The blinding fulfills both prophecies exactly.<p>&#8226; Blindness powerfully pictures judgment throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>), reminding us that willful spiritual blindness may lead to very real loss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>bound him with bronze shackles</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar &#8220;bound him with bronze shackles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bronze, a hard metal, underscores the strength and permanence of the captivity (<a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Being chained was part of the covenant curse for persistent disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>). Zedekiah&#8217;s refusal to heed God&#8217;s repeated calls to surrender (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-18</a>) brought him under that curse.<p>&#8226; The image contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s desire to free His people (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>); the chains illustrate how rebellion enslaves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took him to Babylon</b><p>Zedekiah was &#8220;taken to Babylon,&#8221; the very city he had hoped never to see.<p>&#8226; This removal completes the judgment foretold in <a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>.<p>&#8226; Babylon symbolizes the world&#8217;s power in opposition to God (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-5.htm">Revelation 17:5</a>).

Every phrase fulfills specific prophecies, proving that the Lord&#8217;s promises&#8212;whether of judgment or mercy&#8212;are utterly reliable. Zedekiah&#8217;s blinded eyes, bronze chains, forced march, and lifelong imprisonment remind us that ignoring God&#8217;s counsel brings real, painful consequences, while also pointing ahead to the perfect King who would one day bear judgment for His people and open blind eyes to the light of salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/52.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And put him in prison till the day of his death.</span>--This also is an additional detail not mentioned in 2 Kings 25, and its absence is probably due to the fact that that was the earlier narrative of the two. The word for "prison" is a peculiar one, and differs from that in <a href="/jeremiah/52-31.htm" title="And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.">Jeremiah 52:31</a>. Literally it means "house of visitation," and this may imply either stricter custody, or more severe punishment in addition to imprisonment. The LXX. renders it by "house of the mill," as though Zedekiah, after he had been blinded, had been made to do slave work like that of Samson. Possibly this was merely an inference from <a href="/lamentations/5-13.htm" title="They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.">Lamentations 5:13</a>. Such treatment of captive kings was, however, quite in keeping with the character of Assyrian and Chaldaean rulers. Thus Assur-bani-pal boasts that he placed a king of Arabia in chains, and bound him with the dogs, and caused him to be kept in one of the great gates of Nineveh (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 93). So Darius, in the <span class= "ital">Behistun </span>inscription, boasts of having taken a rebel king of Sagartia, cut off his nose and ears, and kept him chained at his door (<span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>i. p. 119).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In prison;</span> literally, <span class="accented">in the house of custody.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he put out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;iw&#183;w&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5786.htm">Strong's 5786: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make blind, blind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Zedekiah&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;i&#7695;&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6667.htm">Strong's 6667: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zedekiah -- 'Yah is righteousness', six Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">eyes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bound</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;as&#183;r&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
