It serves as a divine alert, indicating that what follows is of great importance and should be carefully considered. In the context of Jeremiah, it underscores the certainty and seriousness of God's message to Edom.<p><b>I will make you small among nations,</b><br>This prophecy is directed towards Edom, a nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother. Historically, Edom was a powerful and influential nation due to its strategic location and control over trade routes. However, this phrase indicates a divine judgment that will reduce Edom's status and influence. The "smallness" here refers to both a loss of power and a decrease in population. This prophecy was fulfilled as Edom eventually became insignificant and was absorbed by other cultures.<p><b>despised among men.</b><br>Edom's pride and arrogance, as mentioned in other parts of Jeremiah and Obadiah, led to its downfall. Being "despised among men" suggests a loss of respect and honor, not only from neighboring nations but also from within. This reflects the biblical principle that pride precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The Edomites' betrayal of Israel during times of distress contributed to their negative reputation. This phrase also serves as a warning to all nations and individuals about the consequences of pride and betrayal.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.

In the immediate context, Jeremiah has just heard a &#8220;message from the LORD&#8221; sent to the nations concerning Edom (<a href="/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>). God is not making a suggestion; He is declaring an unalterable decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make you</b><p>Every verb is in God&#8217;s hand.
