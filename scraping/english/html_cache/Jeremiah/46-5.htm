The prophet Jeremiah is given a vision of the chaos and defeat of Egypt's army. It suggests a sense of bewilderment and urgency, as if witnessing something unexpected or shocking. This rhetorical question emphasizes the suddenness and severity of the situation, drawing attention to the unfolding events as part of God's sovereign plan.<p><b>They are terrified,</b><br>The fear described here is profound and overwhelming. In the context of ancient warfare, terror often preceded defeat, as morale was crucial for victory. This fear is indicative of the psychological warfare that God uses against Egypt, fulfilling His judgment. The terror can be seen as a divine intervention, where God instills fear to accomplish His purposes, similar to how He caused confusion among Israel's enemies in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p><b>they are retreating;</b><br>The retreat signifies a breakdown in the military strategy and confidence of Egypt's forces. Historically, Egypt was a powerful nation, often seen as invincible. This retreat marks a significant turning point, highlighting the vulnerability of even the mightiest nations when they oppose God's will. It echoes the theme of divine retribution and the futility of relying on human strength against God's decrees.<p><b>their warriors are defeated,</b><br>The defeat of the warriors underscores the totality of Egypt's downfall. In ancient cultures, warriors were esteemed for their strength and bravery. Their defeat symbolizes the collapse of Egypt's military might and the failure of its gods and idols to protect them. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative where God consistently demonstrates His power over the nations and their false deities (e.g., <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).<p><b>they flee in haste without looking back;</b><br>This imagery of fleeing without looking back conveys panic and disorder. It suggests a complete rout, where the soldiers are so consumed by fear that they abandon all sense of duty and honor. This mirrors the flight of Lot's wife in <a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>, where looking back signifies attachment to the past and disobedience. Here, it emphasizes the irreversible nature of God's judgment on Egypt.<p><b>terror is on every side!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "terror is on every side" is a recurring motif in Jeremiah, often used to describe the inescapable nature of God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25, 20</a>:3). It paints a picture of total encirclement by fear, leaving no avenue for escape. This comprehensive terror serves as a warning to all nations that oppose God, illustrating the completeness of His justice.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The declaration by the LORD affirms the divine authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is not merely a human prediction but a statement from God Himself, ensuring its fulfillment. This underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and His active role in the affairs of nations. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the prophetic office, where the prophet speaks not on his own behalf but as a mouthpiece for God, reinforcing the trustworthiness and seriousness of the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.

The question captures surprise&#8212;Egypt had long seemed invincible to surrounding nations. &#8226; Jeremiah often opens visions with a startled &#8220;Why?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-21.htm">Jeremiah 4:21</a>; 14:8). &#8226; Habakkuk voiced a similar shock: &#8220;Why do You make me see iniquity?&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>). The phrase reminds us that God lets His servants see what ordinary eyes miss, so that the coming judgment can be announced with certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are terrified</b><p>Egypt&#8217;s seasoned soldiers are now gripped by fear. &#8226; &#8220;The idols of Egypt will tremble before Him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>) predicted nationwide panic. &#8226; When Israel crossed the Red Sea, terror fell on Egypt (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>); the same God can repeat judgment generations later. What man boasts in today can be swept away tomorrow when the Lord turns courage into dread.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are retreating</b><p>The army once marching in confidence now turns its back. &#8226; After Babylon&#8217;s rise, &#8220;The king of Egypt did not march out of his land again&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>). &#8226; Jeremiah later says, &#8220;Her mercenaries also retreat&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-21.htm">Jeremiah 46:21</a>). A forced retreat undercuts human pride and exposes false security in military strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Their warriors are defeated</b><p>Defeat is total&#8212;officers and elite troops fall together. &#8226; &#8220;Why have your mighty ones been laid low? They cannot stand&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15</a>). &#8226; Ezekiel echoes, &#8220;Egypt&#8217;s proud strength will come to an end&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty over battles ensures that no earthly power can resist His decreed outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They flee in haste without looking back</b><p>Panic drives the rout; self-preservation overrides discipline. &#8226; Lot was told, &#8220;Run for your lives! Do not look back&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>); here the soldiers do it instinctively. &#8226; In prophetic warnings to Judah, God had said the same picture would occur (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>). When God&#8217;s hand moves, even trained warriors scatter like startled animals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Terror is on every side!</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s trademark phrase &#8220;Magor-Missabib&#8221; appears again (<a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>). &#8226; &#8220;I hear the whispering of many&#8212;terror on every side!&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>). &#8226; &#8220;Do not go out on the road, for the enemy has a sword; terror is on every side&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>). The expression sums up utter helplessness: danger presses from every direction, leaving no refuge except the Lord Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>The closing words anchor the vision in divine authority. &#8226; &#8220;The mouth of the LORD has spoken&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a>) carries judicial weight; so does &#8220;declares the LORD&#8221; throughout Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>; 4:28). Because the statement comes from God, its fulfillment is guaranteed&#8212;history must bend to His pronouncement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a> portrays Egypt&#8217;s proud army crumbling in sudden panic: terrified, retreating, defeated, fleeing headlong under all-encompassing terror. Each phrase shows the Lord dismantling human strength to prove that He alone rules nations and wars. What seemed unshakable falls instantly when God speaks. The verse therefore urges every reader to place trust not in earthly power but in the unassailable word the Lord has declared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Wherefore have I seen them dismayed . . .?</span>--The prophet speaks as seeing already in his mind's eye the confusion of the defeated army, with no way to escape, driven back on the Euphrates.
