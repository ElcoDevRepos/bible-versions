The priests and prophets were religious leaders, often seen as mediators between God and the people. However, during Jeremiah's time, many were corrupt or false, leading the people astray (<a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11-14</a>). The inclusion of "all the people" indicates a public setting, emphasizing the widespread impact of Jeremiah's message. This gathering reflects the communal nature of worship and religious instruction in ancient Israel.<p><b>heard Jeremiah speaking</b><br>Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to deliver God's messages, often involving calls to repentance and warnings of judgment. His speaking was not just a casual conversation but a divinely inspired proclamation. The act of hearing implies accountability; those who heard were responsible for responding to the message. This echoes the biblical theme that faith comes by hearing the word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>these words</b><br>The specific words Jeremiah spoke were warnings of impending judgment due to the people's disobedience and idolatry. This message was consistent with the covenantal themes found throughout the Old Testament, where blessings and curses were contingent upon Israel's faithfulness (Deuteronomy 28). Jeremiah's words were not his own but were given by God, underscoring the authority and seriousness of the message.<p><b>in the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites. It was considered the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The setting in the temple underscores the gravity of Jeremiah's message, as it was delivered in the most sacred space, where the people were expected to be most attuned to God's voice. This location also highlights the irony of the people's unfaithfulness, as they were defiling the very place meant for worship and communion with God (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Their hearing makes them fully accountable. The verse underscores that when God&#8217;s servants faithfully proclaim His word, the truth reaches the leadership, the influencers, and the masses alike. Whether they heed or resist will determine their destiny, but the messenger has delivered the message in the heart of national worship, leaving no room for excuse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The priests and the prophets.</span>--The mention of the latter is significant. Jeremiah had to separate himself from both the orders to which he belonged, in the one case, by birth, in the other, by a special vocation. His bitterest foes were found among those who claimed to speak as he did, in the name of the Lord, but who tuned their voice according to the time, and prophesied deceits. See Notes on <a href="/context/jeremiah/23-9.htm" title="My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.">Jeremiah 23:9-40</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-11.</span> - To all devout Jews this prediction of the destruction of the temple must have been startling; but to those who placed their confidence in the mere exist-once of a consecrated building (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>), it was like a blow aimed at their very life. Besides, were not the majority of the prophets of Jehovah of entirely another way of thinking? Did they not promise peace? And what could justify Jeremiah in announcing not merely war, but the downfall of the Divine habitation itself? Hence no sooner had the prophet concluded his discourse, than he was arrested, accused, and condemned to death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The priests,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
