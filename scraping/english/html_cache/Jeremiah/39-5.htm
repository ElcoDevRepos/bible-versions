Jeremiah had already warned Zedekiah, &#8220;You will not escape from his hand&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>). He ignored the warning, but the Word held true. Just as Pharoah&#8217;s chariots bore down on Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a>), the Chaldeans close the gap here. God&#8217;s message is unmistakable: disobedience cannot outrun divine judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/12-12.htm">Ezekiel 12:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho</b><p>The plains of Jericho lie about twenty&#8208;five miles east of Jerusalem, a fertile, open stretch that leaves no place to hide.

Jericho was once the first city Israel conquered in faith (<a href="/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1&#8211;20</a>); now it becomes the last ground Israel&#8217;s king holds in rebellion. Zedekiah could not cross the Jordan to safety, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&#8221; See also <a href="/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/52-8.htm">Jeremiah 52:8</a> for the same scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They seized him</b><p>The moment of capture underlines the certainty of God&#8217;s earlier word: &#8220;Your eyes will see the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you face to face&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>). Zedekiah&#8217;s personal strength, political alliances, and fortified city all failed. As with Saul&#8217;s capture by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3&#8211;4</a>) and Samson&#8217;s fall into Philistine hands (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>), personal compromise leads to physical captivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath</b><p>Riblah, some 200 miles north of Jerusalem, served as Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s military headquarters (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>). Hauling Zedekiah so far underscores total defeat. From God&#8217;s perspective, Nebuchadnezzar is &#8220;My servant&#8221; executing judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The scene reminds us of Job being brought before God&#8217;s throne for examination (<a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>); the ultimate authority is never in question.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he pronounced judgment on him</b><p>Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s verdict&#8212;soon detailed in <a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6&#8211;7</a>&#8212;fulfills prophetic warnings down to every detail (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18&#8211;20</a>). The king sees his sons slain, then loses his own sight, dying later in Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). What looks like Babylonian justice is in fact divine justice: &#8220;The LORD is righteous, for I have rebelled against His command&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a>). God&#8217;s judgments are precise, impartial, and inescapable, yet always consistent with His previous word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a> shows prophecy turning into history: powerful armies, strategic locations, and human decisions all bend to God&#8217;s sovereign plan. Zedekiah&#8217;s flight, capture, and sentencing illustrate that ignoring God&#8217;s word leads inevitably to judgment, while every step of the account underscores the reliability of Scripture and the certainty that the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">In the plains of Jericho.</span>--Here again we have the distinctive word, the <span class= "ital">Araboth </span>of the Jordan, the enlargement of the Jordan valley, three miles wide, near Jericho.

It was, therefore, a natural post of observation for the Chaldaean king while his generals were carrying on the sieges of Tyre and Jerusalem.
