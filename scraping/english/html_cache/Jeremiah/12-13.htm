In biblical times, sowing wheat was a common agricultural practice, symbolizing hope for a fruitful harvest. However, the result of harvesting thorns instead of wheat signifies judgment and the consequences of sin. This imagery is reminiscent of the curse in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-18</a>, where the ground produces thorns and thistles as a result of Adam's disobedience. The metaphor underscores the principle that spiritual rebellion leads to unproductive and painful outcomes, aligning with the broader biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><b>They have exhausted themselves to no avail.</b><br>This phrase reflects the fruitlessness of the people's labor and efforts. Despite their hard work, they achieve nothing of value, illustrating the vanity of human endeavors apart from God's blessing. This can be connected to <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>, where the people labor but are never satisfied, emphasizing the emptiness of pursuits without divine favor. The historical context of Jeremiah's time includes the looming threat of Babylonian invasion, which would render the people's efforts futile as their land and produce would be taken or destroyed.<p><b>Bear the shame of your harvest because of the fierce anger of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the shame of the harvest is a direct result of God's judgment. The people are called to acknowledge their disgrace, which is a consequence of their covenant unfaithfulness. The "fierce anger of the LORD" indicates divine wrath against persistent sin and idolatry, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. This phrase serves as a warning and a call to repentance, echoing the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. Theologically, it points to the necessity of aligning with God's will to avoid judgment, and it foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ, who bears the shame and wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The sentence of failure is already written on everything. The best plans are marred, the "wheat" turned to "thorns."
