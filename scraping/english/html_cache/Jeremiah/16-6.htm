In the context of Jeremiah's prophecy, this reflects the impending Babylonian invasion and the resulting devastation. The universality of the judgment underscores the severity of Israel's sin and the impartiality of God's justice. This echoes the theme found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>, where judgment begins at the sanctuary and affects all people regardless of status.<p><b>They will not be buried or mourned,</b><br>The lack of burial and mourning rites signifies extreme dishonor and disgrace, as proper burial was a significant cultural and religious practice in ancient Israel. This reflects the chaos and desolation that will accompany the Babylonian conquest, where the dead will be so numerous that traditional mourning practices will be impossible. This is reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where disobedience leads to bodies being left unburied.<p><b>nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them.</b><br>Cutting oneself and shaving the head were traditional mourning practices in the ancient Near East, often associated with expressing deep grief.
