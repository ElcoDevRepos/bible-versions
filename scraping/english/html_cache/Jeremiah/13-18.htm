In the context of Jeremiah, this likely refers to King Jehoiachin and his mother Nehushta. The queen mother held a position of power and respect, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>, where Solomon honored Bathsheba. The inclusion of the queen mother highlights the gravity of the message and the impending judgment on the royal family.<p><b>Take a lowly seat:</b><br>This command signifies a humbling or demotion from their positions of power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seating arrangements were symbolic of one's status and authority. To be told to take a lowly seat is a metaphor for losing power and prestige. This reflects the theme of divine judgment and reversal of fortunes, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>, where God brings down rulers from their thrones.<p><b>for your glorious crowns have fallen from your heads:</b><br>The imagery of fallen crowns symbolizes the loss of authority and the end of a dynasty. Crowns represent royal power and divine favor, and their removal indicates God's judgment and the cessation of their rule. This prophecy was fulfilled when Jehoiachin was taken captive to Babylon, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>.

This and the title of "mistress" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as "mistress," or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (<a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>.). From an historical point of view, the "queen-mother" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.).
