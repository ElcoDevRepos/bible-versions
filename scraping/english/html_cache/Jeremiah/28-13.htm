Hananiah had previously contradicted Jeremiah's prophecies by claiming that the Babylonian yoke would be broken within two years. This confrontation highlights the role of true prophets in delivering God's messages, even when they are unpopular or confrontational. The name Hananiah means "Yahweh is gracious," which is ironic given his false prophecies.<p><b>that this is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase underscores the authority of the message. It is not Jeremiah's personal opinion but a divine pronouncement. This emphasizes the importance of discerning true prophecy, which comes directly from God, as opposed to false prophecy, which originates from human desires or deceit.<p><b>&#8216;You have broken a yoke of wood,</b><br>The yoke of wood symbolizes the temporary and lighter burden that Hananiah claimed would be removed from Judah. In ancient times, a yoke was a symbol of subjugation and servitude. Hananiah's breaking of the wooden yoke was a symbolic act meant to reassure the people of Judah that their oppression under Babylon would soon end.<p><b>but in its place you have fashioned a yoke of iron.&#8217;</b><br>The yoke of iron represents a much harsher and inescapable bondage. This imagery is used to convey the severity of the consequences of Hananiah's false prophecy. Iron, being stronger and more durable than wood, signifies the intensified oppression that Judah would face under Babylonian rule. This prophecy aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where a yoke of iron is mentioned as a curse for disobedience.

Hananiah&#8217;s symbolic victory was hollow; breaking the wooden yoke only ensured a stronger iron one. When people reject God&#8217;s corrective measures, they invite heavier discipline. God&#8217;s pronouncement through Jeremiah proves literal, certain, and rooted in His righteous purpose: submission to His will brings life, while resistance forges chains that cannot be broken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The yokes of wood</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">yoke of wood</span>. The word rendered in the Authorized Version" yokes" means properly "poles," two of which, with the "bands," composed a "yoke" (see on Jeremiah 27:2). <span class="cmt_word">But thou shalt make</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span> thou hast made. The sense in which Hananiah is said to have made "a yoke of iron" (we should render in the singular) comes out in ver. 14. The point is that there was a certain justification for Hananiah's violent act, but not that which he supposed. Jeremiah's wooden yoke was really an inadequate symbol; the prophet was too tender to his people. Thus God made the truth appear in still fuller brightness from the very perverseness of its enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/28-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
