The call to "warn the nations" suggests that the impending judgment is not only for Israel but has implications for surrounding nations. In the biblical context, God often used Israel as a means to reveal His power and justice to other nations (e.g., <a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>). The warning serves as a call to repentance and awareness of God's sovereignty over all nations, not just Israel.<p><b>Proclaim to Jerusalem:</b><br>Jerusalem, as the capital city and spiritual center of Judah, is the focal point of this proclamation. The city represents the heart of the nation's religious and political life. Historically, Jerusalem was often the target of foreign invasions due to its strategic and symbolic significance. The call to proclaim to Jerusalem underscores the seriousness of the message and the need for the inhabitants to heed the warning. This also reflects the role of prophets as God's messengers to His people, urging them to return to Him.<p><b>A besieging army comes from a distant land;</b><br>This phrase indicates the source of the impending threat. Historically, Judah faced invasions from powerful empires such as Assyria and Babylon, which were located in distant lands. The mention of a "besieging army" evokes the imagery of warfare and destruction, common in the ancient Near East. This serves as a fulfillment of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>, where God warns of a nation coming from afar as a consequence of disobedience.<p><b>They raise their voices against the cities of Judah.</b><br>The raising of voices against Judah's cities signifies the enemy's intent to conquer and destroy. This reflects the historical reality of military campaigns where invaders would often taunt and demoralize their opponents (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/18-28.htm">2 Kings 18:28-35</a>). The cities of Judah, representing the broader community beyond Jerusalem, are also under threat, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the coming judgment. This phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God and the need for national repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

It is often a focal point in prophetic warnings due to its significance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is the primary audience of Jeremiah's prophecies.

Believers can find comfort in knowing that God is in control, even amidst political and social turmoil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Judah's impending judgment serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience to God. Christians are encouraged to examine their lives and turn away from sin to avoid similar consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_messengers.htm">The Role of Prophets and Messengers</a></b><br>Jeremiah's role as a prophet highlights the importance of faithful messengers who deliver God's truth, even when it is unpopular. Believers are called to be bold in sharing God's message of salvation and warning.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_amidst_judgment.htm">Hope Amidst Judgment</a></b><br>While Jeremiah's message is one of impending judgment, it also points to the hope of restoration.

God&#8217;s warning is not limited to Judah; it is broadcast &#8220;to the nations,&#8221; underscoring His sovereign rule over every people.<p>&#8226; The same trumpet-blast language appears earlier: &#8220;Announce in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, &#8216;Blow the trumpet throughout the land&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Like a watchman on the wall (<a href="/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2-7</a>), Jeremiah is to alert outsiders so they understand God&#8217;s righteousness when judgment falls.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6-7</a> echoes this global summons, calling &#8220;every nation, tribe, tongue, and people&#8221; to fear God before final wrath.<p>The literal invasion about to strike Judah also functions as a living sermon to the world: sin brings real, measurable consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Proclaim to Jerusalem</b><p>Now the focus narrows to God&#8217;s covenant city. The warning must ring inside the walls of Zion because judgment begins with the household of God (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, Jerusalem trusted temple rituals while tolerating idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries earlier, God had set His Name in this city (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>); therefore, coming discipline would be both painful and corrective.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a> records how prophets &#8220;rose up early&#8221; to speak, yet the people mocked. Proclaiming gives them one more chance to repent before the Babylonian siege tightens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;A besieging army comes from a distant land&#8221;</b><p>The prophecy gets specific: Babylon is literally on the march from the north-east plains.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Behold, I am bringing against you a nation from afar, O house of Israel&#8230; an ancient and enduring nation&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Moses had foreseen this exact scenario: &#8220;The LORD will raise up a nation against you from far away&#8230; a nation whose language you will not understand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>).<p>&#8226; History confirms the fulfillment in 605-586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10, 25</a>:1).<p>That distant army proves God&#8217;s Word is not abstract; it lands in geographical space and recorded time&#8212;an unbroken chain between prophecy and fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They raise their voices against the cities of Judah&#8221;</b><p>The invaders will not merely surround Jerusalem; they will &#8220;raise their voices,&#8221; shouting battle cries, demanding surrender, and spreading terror.<p>&#8226; &#8220;I am calling all the kingdoms of the north&#8230; and they will come and set each throne at the entrance to the gates of Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;cities of Judah&#8221; shows the judgment is comprehensive, reaching every fortified town (<a href="/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; When Babylon&#8217;s generals lifted their voices, walls crumbled and hearts melted (<a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22-25</a>).<p>For modern readers, it&#8217;s a sober reminder: God&#8217;s warnings are not empty threats&#8212;His discipline can penetrate every layer of presumed security.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/4-16.htm">Jeremiah 4:16</a> is a four-fold trumpet blast:<p>&#8226; God tells His messenger to broadcast judgment universally&#8212;sin has global implications.<p>&#8226; He targets His own people first, urging repentance before the siege overtakes them.<p>&#8226; He identifies a literal enemy from a far land, validating the accuracy of Scripture when Babylon actually arrives.<p>&#8226; He foresees the invaders&#8217; shouts reverberating through every Judean city, proving no refuge exists outside obedience to the Lord.<p>The verse therefore calls every generation to heed God&#8217;s warnings early, trust His Word completely, and turn from sin while there is still time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Make ye mention.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Proclaim ye to the nations; behold. </span>Call them to gaze on the ruin of Jerusalem, then, <span class= "ital">Cry aloud as for Jerusalem, that watchers </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the besieging armies) <span class= "ital">are coming from a far country, and that they will give out their voice </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e. </span>raise the cry of war) <span class= "ital">against the cities of Judah.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make ye mention</span>, etc. This verse contains a call to the neighboring nations to take notice of an event which nearly concerns them all.
