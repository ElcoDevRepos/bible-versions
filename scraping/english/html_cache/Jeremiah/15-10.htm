This phrase reflects the personal anguish and isolation Jeremiah feels due to his prophetic mission. The lament is reminiscent of Job's complaints about his birth (<a href="/job/3.htm">Job 3:1-3</a>), highlighting the intense suffering and emotional burden of being a prophet. Jeremiah's lament can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was "despised and rejected by men" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>a man of strife and conflict in all the land</b><br>Jeremiah's role as a prophet brought him into constant conflict with the people of Judah, who resisted his messages of impending judgment. This strife is not just personal but national, as Jeremiah's prophecies often contradicted the desires and beliefs of the people and their leaders. The phrase underscores the widespread nature of the opposition he faced, similar to the opposition Jesus faced from the religious leaders of His time (<a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>).<p><b>I have neither lent nor borrowed</b><br>In ancient Israel, lending and borrowing were common practices that could lead to disputes and enmity. By stating he has neither lent nor borrowed, Jeremiah emphasizes that his conflicts are not due to personal financial dealings or typical social interactions. This highlights the unjust nature of the hostility he faces, as his only "offense" is delivering God's message. This can be compared to Jesus, who was without sin yet faced hostility and false accusations (<a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>).<p><b>yet everyone curses me</b><br>The universal nature of the curses against Jeremiah reflects the deep-seated resistance to his prophetic message. This widespread cursing is indicative of the spiritual state of the nation, which had turned away from God. The phrase echoes the experience of other prophets and foreshadows the rejection of Christ, who was also cursed and reviled by the people He came to save (<a href="/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>).

His sorrow shows the personal cost of obedience, yet his honesty&#8212;and God&#8217;s subsequent reassurance (15:20&#8211;21)&#8212;demonstrate that the Lord sustains those who stand firm for truth even when the world curses them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Woe is me . . .</span>--The abruptness of the transition suggests the thought that we have a distinct fragment which has been merged in the artificial continuity of the chapter. Possibly, as some have thought, <a href="/context/jeremiah/15-10.htm" title="Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.">Jeremiah 15:10-11</a> have been misplaced in transcription, and should come after <a href="/jeremiah/15-14.htm" title="And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.">Jeremiah 15:14</a>, where they fit in admirably with the context. The sequence of thought may, however, be that the picture of the sorrowing mother in the previous verses suggests the reflection that there may be other causes for a mother's sorrow than that of which he has spoken, and so he bursts out into the cry, "Woe is me, my mother!" The prophet feels more than ever the awfulness of his calling as a vessel of God's truth. He, too, found that he had come "not to send peace on earth, but a sword" (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm" title="Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.">Matthew 10:34</a>). His days were as full of strife as the life of the usurer, whose quarrels with his debtors had become the proverbial type of endless litigation. As examples of the working of the law of debt, see <a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="/context/proverbs/6-1.htm" title="My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-2.htm" title="And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-5.htm" title="He that puts not out his money to usury, nor takes reward against the innocent.

They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4, 5</a>, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in <a href="/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a>. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness.
