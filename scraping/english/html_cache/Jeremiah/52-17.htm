The bronze pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, were significant architectural features of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>). The bronze Sea was a large basin used by the priests for ceremonial washing (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>).

The removal of these sacred items underscores the severity of God's judgment on His people for their idolatry and unfaithfulness. It also highlights the theme of exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history, which serves as a backdrop for understanding the need for restoration and redemption. The carrying away of the temple's bronze can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate restoration through Jesus Christ, who would bring a new covenant and a spiritual temple not made with hands (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A people from southern Babylonia, known for their military prowess and as the ruling class of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.
