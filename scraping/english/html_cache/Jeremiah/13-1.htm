In the context of the prophetic books, such direct revelations are common, underscoring the role of prophets as God's messengers. This communication style is consistent with other prophetic books, such as Isaiah and Ezekiel, where God frequently speaks directly to His prophets.<p><b>Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth:</b><br>The instruction to purchase a linen loincloth is significant. Linen was a fabric often associated with purity and priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>). The loincloth, a garment worn close to the body, symbolizes intimacy and personal relationship. This act serves as a symbolic representation of Israel's relationship with God, intended to be pure and close. The purchase of the loincloth also indicates a deliberate action, suggesting the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>and put it around your waist:</b><br>Wearing the loincloth around the waist signifies the intended closeness and binding relationship between God and His people. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the waist was considered the center of strength and activity, symbolizing readiness and preparedness. This act of wearing the loincloth represents how Israel was meant to be bound to God, serving Him faithfully and being His chosen people.<p><b>but do not let it touch water:</b><br>The instruction to keep the loincloth from water suggests the need to maintain its purity and integrity. Water, in this context, could symbolize external influences or corruption that would defile the garment. This mirrors the spiritual state of Israel, which was meant to remain untainted by idolatry and sin. The prohibition against washing the loincloth highlights the theme of impending judgment due to Israel's failure to remain pure and faithful to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Scripture presents the prophetic voice as God&#8217;s literal word to His people (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the command comes from &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; what follows carries divine authority; Jeremiah is not acting on his own initiative but under explicit instruction.<p>&#8226; This reminds us that God still speaks through His written Word with the same authority today (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go and buy yourself a linen loincloth</b><p>&#8226; A loincloth (or belt) was a common, close&#8211;fitting undergarment. Linen, required for priests&#8217; garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), symbolized purity and devotion.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s choice of linen signals that the object lesson will spotlight holiness. Later in the chapter the loincloth represents Judah and Jerusalem, a people chosen to walk in purity (<a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Buying the garment&#8212;rather than receiving it&#8212;underscores intentional, personal investment. Prophets often acted out messages to make them unforgettable (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put it around your waist</b><p>&#8226; Fastening the belt to the waist pictures intimacy and nearness. God intended His people to &#8220;cling&#8221; to Him as a belt clings to a man (<a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm">Jeremiah 13:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The waist also suggests strength and readiness (<a href="/1_peter/1-13.htm">1 Peter 1:13</a>, &#8220;gird up the loins of your mind&#8221;). Israel was to draw its strength from close fellowship with the Lord, not from alliances or idols (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13, 18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But do not let it touch water</b><p>&#8226; New linen was normally washed before wear; forbidding water keeps the cloth stiff and fragile, a setup for the later stage when God has Jeremiah bury it and find it ruined (<a href="/jeremiah/13-6.htm">Jeremiah 13:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The untouched fabric represents initial purity. Any future corruption will result not from ordinary wear but from deliberate disobedience&#8212;mirroring Judah&#8217;s willful sin (<a href="/jeremiah/2-22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a>, &#8220;Though you wash yourself with lye&#8230; your guilt is still before Me&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The command highlights how quickly holiness decays when fellowship with God is neglected; what is kept from cleansing soon becomes useless (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1</a> launches a living parable: God tells the prophet to purchase a pure linen belt, wear it close, and keep it unwashed. Every detail is deliberate. The linen signals holiness, the waist signifies intimacy, and the ban on water sets the stage to show how stubborn sin ruins what was meant for honor. God&#8217;s message is timeless: He calls His people to cling to Him in undefiled devotion, warning that departure from His Word inevitably leads to spiritual decay and loss of purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">A linen girdle.</span>--The point of comparison is given in <a href="/jeremiah/13-11.htm" title="For as the girdle sticks to the loins of a man, so have I caused to stick to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, said the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.">Jeremiah 13:11</a>. Of all garments worn by man the girdle was that most identified with the man's activity, nearest to his person. The "linen girdle" was part of Jeremiah's priestly dress (<a href="/exodus/28-40.htm" title="And for Aaron's sons you shall make coats, and you shall make for them girdles, and bonnets shall you make for them, for glory and for beauty.">Exodus 28:40</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm" title="He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen turban shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and this also was significant in the interpretation of the symbolic act. Israel, represented as the girdle of Jehovah, had been chosen for consecrated uses. The word "get" implies the act of purchasing, and this too was not without its symbolic significance.<p><span class= "bld">Put it not in water.</span>--The work of the priest as a rule necessarily involved frequent washings both of flesh and garments. The command in this case was therefore exceptional. The unwashed girdle was to represent the guilt of the people unpurified by any real contact with the "clean water" of repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>). In the "filthy garments" of Joshua, in <a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm" title="Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.">Zechariah 3:3</a>, we have a like symbolism. This seems a much more natural interpretation than that which starts from the idea that water would spoil the girdle, and sees in the command the symbol of God's care for His people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - The entire people of the Jews is like a good-for-nothing apron. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A linen girdle</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a linen apron</span>. "Girdle" is one of the meanings of the Hebrew ('<span class="accented">ezor</span>), but is here unsuitable. As Ver. 11 shows, it is an inner garment that is meant, one that "cleaveth to the loins of a man" (in fact, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Septuagint, the <span class="accented">lumbare</span> of the Vulgate). The corresponding Arabic word, '<span class="accented">izar</span>, has, according to Lane, the meaning of "waist-wrapper.' Israel was to Jehovah in as close a relation spiritually as that in which the inner garment referred to is to him who wears it materially. There is an Arabic proverb which well illustrates this: "He is to me in place of an '<span class="accented">izar"</span> (Freytag, 'Studium der Arab. Spraohe,' p. 298). "A linen apron" may perhaps be specified, because linen was the material of the priestly dress (<a href="/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and Israel was to be spiritually" a kingdom of priests." But this is not absolutely necessary. The common man used linen in his dress as well as the priest; the only difference between them was that the priest was confined to linen garments. But an ,' apron" would in any case naturally be made of linen. <span class="cmt_word">Linen</span>; literally, flax (a product of Judah, <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Put it not in water</span>. The object of the prohibition is well stated by St. Jerome.
