Initially, they had made a vow to release their Hebrew slaves, aligning with the law in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>, which required the release of Hebrew slaves after six years of service. By reneging on this promise, they not only broke their word but also dishonored God's name, as their actions were a direct violation of His commandments. This reflects a broader theme in Jeremiah, where the people's unfaithfulness and disobedience lead to divine judgment.<p><b>Each of you has taken back the menservants and maidservants</b><br>The act of taking back the servants signifies a return to oppressive practices, reminiscent of Israel's own history of slavery in Egypt. This regression underscores a failure to learn from past deliverance and a disregard for God's laws designed to promote justice and mercy. The cultural context of the time placed significant emphasis on social hierarchy and economic stability, often at the expense of the vulnerable, which God consistently condemned through His prophets.<p><b>whom you had set at liberty to go wherever they wanted,</b><br>The initial release of the slaves was a moment of obedience and a reflection of God's desire for freedom and justice, as seen in the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). This act was meant to restore dignity and autonomy to the individuals, allowing them to reintegrate into society as free persons. The reversal of this decision highlights the fickleness of human commitment and the ease with which societal pressures can lead to moral compromise.<p><b>and you have again forced them to be your slaves.</b><br>Re-enslaving the freed individuals represents a grave injustice and a direct affront to God's commands. This action not only exploited the vulnerable but also demonstrated a lack of trust in God's provision and justice. Theologically, this mirrors the spiritual bondage that sin creates, from which Christ offers liberation (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).

Yet almost immediately they &#8220;turned back&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-11.htm">Jeremiah 34:11</a>).

Freedom was granted only until the economic pressure or personal preference of the masters pushed them to retrieve what they had just surrendered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and profaned My name</b><p>To revoke a covenant made in God&#8217;s presence dragged His reputation through the mud. <a href="/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a> warns, &#8220;You shall not swear falsely by My name, and so profane the name of your God.&#8221; By reneging, the leaders treated the Lord&#8217;s sworn covenant as negotiable, mirroring the priests who &#8220;despise My name&#8221; in <a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-7</a>. <a href="/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20-23</a> reveals how such behavior among God&#8217;s people gives the nations reason to mock Him. Here, &#8220;My name&#8221; stands for God&#8217;s character; to violate an oath sworn before Him is to suggest He, too, is untrustworthy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Each of you has taken back the menservants and maidservants whom you had set at liberty to go wherever they wanted</b><p>The Law mandated that a Hebrew bonded for debt must be released in the seventh year (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>).
