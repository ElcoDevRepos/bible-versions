The use of the phrase, however, in <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm" title="Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation.">Exodus 34:7</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-25.htm" title="When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:">Deuteronomy 4:25</a>, points rather to an undefined prolongation, subject only to the fact that there was an appointed limit.

The words were clearly meant to point both ways. They warn the nations not to resist the Chaldaean king then. They warn the king not to think that he is founding a dynasty of long duration.
