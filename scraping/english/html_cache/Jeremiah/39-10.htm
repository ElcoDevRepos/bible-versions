His role was crucial in the final siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The decision to leave some people behind reflects a common practice in ancient conquests, where conquerors would leave behind a remnant to tend the land and prevent it from becoming desolate. This action also fulfilled God's prophecy that a remnant would remain in the land (<a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8-10</a>).<p><b>some of the poor people who had no property</b><br>The poor people mentioned here were likely those who had not been involved in the political or military resistance against Babylon. They were considered less of a threat and thus were left to maintain the land. This aligns with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s concern for the poor and marginalized, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments (e.g., <a href="/psalms/72-4.htm">Psalm 72:4</a>, <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). The poor often symbolize those who are humble and reliant on God.<p><b>and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields</b><br>This act of giving vineyards and fields to the poor can be seen as a reversal of fortunes, where those who had nothing were suddenly given stewardship over the land. It reflects the biblical principle of God's provision and care for the needy (<a href="/psalms/113-7.htm">Psalm 113:7-8</a>). This also serves as a type of restoration, hinting at the future hope of Israel's restoration and the coming of the Messiah, who would bring ultimate restoration and justice (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuzaradan.htm">Nebuzaradan</a></b><br>The captain of the guard for the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar.
