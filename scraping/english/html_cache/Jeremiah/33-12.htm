The title "LORD of Hosts" refers to God's command over the heavenly armies, indicating His power and ability to fulfill His promises. This introduction assures the audience that the following message is divinely ordained and trustworthy.<p><b>In this desolate place,</b><br>The context here is the land of Judah and Jerusalem during the Babylonian exile, a time when the land was laid waste and abandoned. The desolation is both physical and spiritual, reflecting the consequences of Israel's disobedience. This phrase sets the stage for a message of hope and restoration, contrasting the current state with the future promise.<p><b>without man or beast,</b><br>This highlights the complete devastation of the land, where human and animal life has been removed. It underscores the severity of God's judgment due to the people's sins. The absence of life signifies a total desolation, making the promise of restoration even more profound.<p><b>and in all its cities,</b><br>The mention of "all its cities" indicates the widespread nature of the desolation, affecting not just Jerusalem but the entire region of Judah. This comprehensive scope of destruction serves to magnify the power of God in His ability to restore what has been utterly ruined.<p><b>there will once more be pastures</b><br>This promise of restoration is significant, as pastures symbolize peace, provision, and prosperity. The return of pastures suggests a reversal of fortune and a return to normalcy and abundance. It reflects God's faithfulness to His covenant and His ability to bring life back to barren places.<p><b>for shepherds to rest their flocks.</b><br>Shepherds and their flocks are often used in Scripture as metaphors for leadership and the people of God. The image of shepherds resting their flocks implies safety, security, and divine care. It also points to the future Messianic age, where Jesus, the Good Shepherd, will lead His people. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the Shepherd of Israel, providing and caring for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

It would seem here to answer to the "towns" of our old English speech, as meaning enclosed spaces, with the tower of the watchman (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm" title="And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.">2Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>), in which, in times of average tranquillity, shepherds and their flocks found shelter, but which were abandoned when the land was overrun by an invading army. In <a href="/jeremiah/33-13.htm" title="In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that tells them, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 33:13</a> the eye of the prophet travels over such districts within the kingdom of Judah to the north and south of Jerusalem, and adds to the picture the vivid touch that the "sheep shall pass under the hands of him that telleth them," the shepherd whose work it was to count the flock--in older English, "to tell his tale"--as it went out in the morning and returned at nightfall, should find that he had lost none of them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An habitation;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a pasture</span> (including the idea of an encampment).
