In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46</a>, it refers to the aftermath of a significant defeat. The setting is likely the battle of Carchemish, where the Egyptian forces were decisively defeated by the Babylonians in 605 BC. The "cry" suggests a recognition of failure and a communal expression of despair or realization.<p><b>&#8216;Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise;</b><br>Pharaoh Necho II, the ruler of Egypt during this period, is the subject here. The phrase "all noise" implies boastfulness without substance. Historically, Pharaoh Necho attempted to assert Egyptian dominance in the region, but his efforts were thwarted by the Babylonians. This critique of Pharaoh echoes the biblical theme of God humbling the proud, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>, where the pride of Babylon is similarly addressed.<p><b>he has let the appointed time pass him by.&#8217;</b><br>The "appointed time" suggests a divinely ordained moment or opportunity that Pharaoh failed to seize. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and leaders, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where God changes times and seasons and deposes kings. Pharaoh's failure to act at the right time underscores the futility of human plans against divine will. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus fulfills the appointed times perfectly, unlike earthly rulers who often fail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, often seen as a symbol of earthly power and pride.

&#8220;There&#8221; points to the battlefield where Egypt collapses, most likely at Carchemish (<a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The cry is a loud lament born of panic and realization that their might cannot stand against the Lord&#8217;s decree, echoing earlier national wails such as <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>.<p>&#8226; God foretells the scene to show His sovereign foreknowledge; nothing about the coming defeat is accidental (<a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh king of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; The title singles out Pharaoh Necho II, but also represents every earthly ruler who trusts in horses and chariots instead of the living God (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29&#8211;35</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-3.htm">Isaiah 31:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often personalizes a nation&#8217;s sin in its monarch, making the judgment unmistakably personal (<a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming him, the Lord shows that no throne is beyond His reach; rulers answer to a higher King (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was all noise</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All noise&#8221; exposes Pharaoh&#8217;s empty boasting: impressive speeches, massive armies&#8212;no real help when God rises up (<a href="/isaiah/30-7.htm">Isaiah 30:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s history of bragging (<a href="/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a>) is contrasted with God&#8217;s quiet but unstoppable plan (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse invites us to measure power not by volume but by alignment with the Almighty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has let the appointed time pass him by</b><p>&#8226; God set a specific &#8220;appointed time&#8221;

His swagger evaporates because he ignored the schedule God Himself set. The verse reminds us that nations and individuals alike must heed God&#8217;s warnings while time remains; boasting without obedience only amplifies defeat when the divinely appointed moment arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They did cry there . . .</span>--Better, Th<span class= "ital">ere they cry<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span> The difficulty of the verse has led to very various renderings. The meaning of the English version is that the exiles returning to their own land would say that Pharaoh with all his haughty boasts was but an empty noise, that he had passed the limit of God's long-suffering, and that the day of retribution had come. A slight change in the Hebrew words, however, gives, <span class= "ital">They have called the name of Pharaoh king of Egypt, A Noise; he hath passed </span>(<span class= "ital">or lost</span>)<span class= "ital"> the appointed season</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the time allowed by the long-suffering of God. This is supported by some of the ancient versions, and may be accepted as the best rendering. The LXX. and Vulg. agree in taking the opening words as an imperative, "Call ye the name of Pharaoh<span class= "bld"> . . . </span>;" but the former, as if despairing of the meaning, simply reproduces the Hebrew words that follow in Greek letters, while the latter translates, <span class= "ital">Tumultum adduxit tempus </span>("Time, the appointed time, has brought the noise"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of war and destruction), as if it were, like <span class= "ital">Magor-missabib, </span>a new <span class= "ital">nomen et omen </span>given to the Egyptian king. Luther, giving another meaning to the words translated "appointed time," renders "Pharaoh king of Egypt lies prostrate, he has left his tent." Ewald, following the line of the Vulgate, renders the name by which Pharaoh is spoken of as "tumult, which a sign or 'moment' disperses," the "tumult" being his boastful clamour, the "sign" the token of Jehovah's will. Hitzig agrees more closely with the English version in the latter clause, and it may be accepted as having on the whole most in its favour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They did cry there,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they cry there</span>, viz. the following words. But why should attention be called to the place where the cry is made? and why should the mercenaries (the subject of the preceding verb, and therefore presumably of this verb) have their exclamation recorded? Alter the vowel points (which merely represent an early but not infallible exegetical tradition), and all becomes clear. We then get a renewal of the summons in ver. 14 to make a proclamation respecting the war. The persons addressed are, not foreigners, but the children of the soil, and the summons runs thus: "Call ye the name of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, Desolation." No longer "Pharaoh," honoured by titles indicating that he, like Apis, is a Divine incarnation (<span class="accented">neb</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lord, and <span class="accented">nuter, i.e.</span> god), but <span class="accented">Shaon</span>, the Hebrew for Desolation, is the fittest name for the fallen monarch. The custom of changing names with a symbolic meaning is no strange one to readers of the prophecies. We have met with it in this very book (see <a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>); and Isaiah contains a parallel as exact as could be desired, in the famous passage in which the prophetic name (itself symbolic) of Egypt (<span class="cmt_word">Rahab</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> boisterousness, arrogance) is changed into "Rahabhem-shebheth" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Rahab! they are utter indolence"). In behalf of this view we may claim the authority of a tradition still older than that preserved in the vowel points, for the Septuagint (followed substantially by the Peshito and the Vulgate) has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He hath passed the time appointed.</span> A difficult clause, and variously interpreted. One thing is clear, that "passed" cannot be correct, as the verb is in the Hifil or causative conjugation. We must, at any rate, render, "He hath let the time appointed pass by." This is, in fact, the simplest and most natural explanation. There was a time within which repentance might have averted the judgment of God; but this "accepted time" has been foolishly let slip. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they will proclaim,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was all noise;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7588.htm">Strong's 7588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A roar (of waters, etcetera), din, crash, uproar</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he has let the appointed time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1461;&#1469;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
