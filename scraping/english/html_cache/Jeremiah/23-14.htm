However, God observes a "horrible thing" among them, indicating a deep corruption and betrayal of their divine calling. This phrase highlights the gravity of their sin, as Jerusalem was the center of worship and prophecy in Israel. The prophets' failure is particularly egregious given their proximity to the temple and the heart of Jewish religious life.<p><b>They commit adultery and walk in lies.</b><br>Adultery here can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it refers to sexual immorality, which was rampant among the leaders. Metaphorically, it signifies spiritual unfaithfulness to God, akin to Israel's idolatry. Walking in lies suggests a lifestyle characterized by deceit and falsehood, contrasting with the truth that prophets were supposed to uphold. This behavior is condemned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>, where lying and adultery are linked to the nation's downfall.<p><b>They strengthen the hands of evildoers,</b><br>Instead of opposing sin, these prophets encourage it, making them complicit in the people's wickedness. By failing to call out sin, they enable and empower those who do evil. This phrase echoes the warning in <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a> against calling evil good and good evil. The prophets' actions directly contradict their role as God's messengers, who should lead people to righteousness.<p><b>so that no one turns his back on wickedness.</b><br>The prophets' failure to denounce sin results in a lack of repentance among the people. Repentance, or turning away from sin, is a central theme in the prophetic message (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>). The absence of repentance leads to moral decay and divine judgment. This phrase underscores the importance of true prophetic ministry in guiding people back to God.<p><b>They are all like Sodom to Me;</b><br>Sodom is synonymous with extreme wickedness and divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. By comparing the prophets to Sodom, God emphasizes the severity of their sin and the impending judgment. This comparison serves as a stark warning, as Sodom's destruction was total and irreversible. It highlights the moral and spiritual degradation of the prophets.<p><b>the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.&#8221;</b><br>Gomorrah, like Sodom, represents utter depravity and the consequences of unrepentant sin. By likening Jerusalem's people to Gomorrah, God indicates that the entire city is steeped in sin, not just the prophets. This comparison foreshadows the coming judgment on Jerusalem, similar to the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. It serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of God's holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the need for repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_jerusalem.htm">Prophets of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who were expected to guide the people in truth but were instead leading them astray.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant in biblical history as the center of worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Ancient cities destroyed by God due to their extreme wickedness, often symbolizing moral decay and divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evildoers.htm">Evildoers</a></b><br>Individuals who engage in sinful behavior, encouraged by the false prophets' teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_false_prophets.htm">The Danger of False Prophets</a></b><br>False prophets lead people away from God by promoting lies and sinful behavior.
