It points to a prophetic vision of change and renewal. The context is the promise of a new covenant, as seen in the broader chapter of <a href="/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>. This future time is often associated with the Messianic age, where old patterns and sayings will be transformed. The phrase "in those days" is frequently used in prophetic literature to denote a significant change brought about by divine intervention.<p><b>The fathers have eaten sour grapes,</b><br>This part of the saying reflects a common proverb of the time, which implied that the consequences of the parents' actions were borne by their children. It highlights the belief in collective responsibility and the generational impact of sin. In the historical context, this proverb was used to explain the suffering of the people during the Babylonian exile, suggesting that the current generation was suffering for the sins of their ancestors. This reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where family and tribal connections were paramount.<p><b>and the teeth of the children are set on edge.</b><br>This imagery conveys the idea of experiencing unpleasant consequences. The "teeth set on edge" suggests a direct, physical reaction to something sour or bitter, symbolizing the inherited suffering or punishment. Theologically, this phrase challenges the notion of inherited guilt, emphasizing individual responsibility for sin. This shift is further developed in <a href="/ezekiel/18.htm">Ezekiel 18</a>, where God declares that each person will be accountable for their own actions. The prophetic message here anticipates the new covenant, where personal responsibility and direct relationship with God are emphasized, ultimately fulfilled in the teachings of Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and personal accountability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.

Men found in it an explanation of their sufferings which relieved their consciences. They were suffering, they said, for the sins of their fathers, not for their own. They distorted the words which, as asserting the continuity of national life, were attached to the second Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>), and instead of finding in them a warning restraining them from evil by the fear of transmitting evil to another generation, they found in them a plea for their own recklessness. Both Ezekiel and Jeremiah felt that the time was come when, even at the risk of a seeming contradiction to words clothed with a Divine authority, the other aspect of God's government had to be asserted in all its fulness: and therefore they lay stress on the truth that each man is responsible for his own acts, and for those alone, and that the law of the inheritance of evil (what we have learnt to call the law of <span class= "ital">heredite</span>) leaves untouched the freedom of man's will. The "eater of the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge," is, as it were, an emendation of the proverbial saying. The words of the Latin poet, "Delicta majorum immeritus lues," "Thou, for <span class= "ital">no </span>guilt of thine, shalt pay the forfeit of thy fathers' sins" (Hor. <span class= "ital">Od. </span>iii. 6, 1), show how ready men have been at all times to make a like excuse. How the two truths are to be reconciled, the law of hereditary tendencies, and punishments that fall not on the original offenders, but on their children, and the law of individual responsibility, is a question to which we can give no formal answer. We must be content to accept both laws, and rest in the belief that the Judge of all the earth will assuredly do right.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have eaten a sour grape;</span> rather, <span class="accented">sour grapes.</span> The prophet (like Ezekiel, ch. 18.) condemns the use of this proverb, and declares that the sinner is the artificer of his own ruin. At first sight, it may seem as if Jeremiah opposes the second commandment, which describes how God "visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children" (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). This, however, cannot really be, for he endorses this declaration later on (<a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The fact is that he is not so much condemning the proverb, as the blasphemous application of it made by the Jews of his time. It is an eternal truth that sin perpetuates itself (except by the miracles of grace) in the children of transgressors, and intensified sin leads to intensified punishment. But the children of transgressors do not cease to be responsible for their own share in the sin; - this was the truth which Jeremiah's contemporaries ignored. He does not deny the solidarity of the family or the race,but he superadds the neglected truth of the special responsibility of the individual. This is one among many evidences of the deepening sense of individual life in the later period of the Jewish monarchy. (A somewhat different view is offered by Delitzsch, 'Messianic Prophecies,' &sect; 50. According to him, Jeremiah looks forward to a time when the individual shall be liberated from the consequences of his solidarity with his race, and when personality shall be "invested with its rights." But can the individual be thus liberated?) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;In those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;h&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
