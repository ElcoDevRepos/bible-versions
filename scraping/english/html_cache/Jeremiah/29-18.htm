The "sword" signifies warfare and violence, often used by God as a tool of judgment (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). "Famine" represents the severe lack of food, a common consequence of prolonged sieges and warfare (<a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>). "Plague" indicates disease, which frequently accompanied war and famine in ancient times. These three calamities are often mentioned together in the Old Testament as instruments of divine retribution (<a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>). Historically, these judgments were realized during the Babylonian conquest, when Jerusalem was besieged, leading to starvation and disease.<p><b>I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth&#8212;</b><br>The phrase "a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth" suggests that the judgment on Judah would serve as a warning to other nations. The destruction and exile of Judah were meant to demonstrate the consequences of turning away from God. This echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience would lead to becoming "an object of horror" among the nations. The historical context of the Babylonian exile, where Judah was defeated and its people scattered, fulfilled this prophecy, making them a cautionary tale for surrounding nations.<p><b>a curse, a desolation, and an object of scorn and reproach among all the nations</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the complete reversal of Judah's fortunes. Once a nation blessed by God, they would become a "curse," meaning others would use them as an example of misfortune (<a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>). "Desolation" indicates utter ruin, as seen in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. Being an "object of scorn and reproach" highlights the shame and humiliation they would face, as other nations would mock their downfall. This reflects the covenantal curses found in <a href="/leviticus/26-32.htm">Leviticus 26:32-33</a>, where disobedience leads to desolation and disgrace.<p><b>to which I banish them.</b><br>The phrase "to which I banish them" refers to the exile of the Jewish people from their homeland. This was a direct consequence of their failure to uphold the covenant with God. The Babylonian exile, beginning in 586 BC, is the historical fulfillment of this prophecy, where the people of Judah were forcibly removed and scattered across the Babylonian Empire. This dispersion served as both punishment and a means for eventual restoration, as God promised to bring them back after a period of repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>). The exile also foreshadows the ultimate gathering of God's people through Christ, who offers redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The Lord personally promises to run down His covenant-breaking people with three classic judgments: warfare, starvation, and disease (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-21.htm">Deuteronomy 28:21-26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Historically this was fulfilled when Babylon besieged Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>), but the words also reveal God&#8217;s unchanging stance toward unrepented sin&#8212;He does not ignore it.<p>&#8226; Note the relentless tone: &#8220;pursue.&#8221; God is not passive; His holiness actively confronts rebellion (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the passage warns that sin invites tangible consequences, and only genuine repentance averts them (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth</b><p>&#8226;

Babylon&#8217;s conquest and the later scatterings turned Judah into a cautionary tale recounted far beyond the Middle East (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-8.htm">2 Chronicles 29:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose is corrective as well as punitive: other nations are to see and fear, recognizing that the Lord judges His own house first (<a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A curse</b><p>&#8226; Instead of being a channel of blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>), the people become a byword for calamity: &#8220;May it be to you as Judah&#8221; (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>; <a href="/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Daniel prayed over this very reality: &#8220;All Israel has transgressed&#8230; the curse has been poured out on us&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/9-11.htm">Daniel 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226;

Historically fulfilled in the Babylonian exile, the verse still speaks: God is holy, sin is costly, and exile&#8212;whether physical or spiritual&#8212;results when His people refuse correction. Yet the same God who pronounces judgment also promises restoration to the repentant, proving that His ultimate aim is not destruction but redemption.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will pursue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1491;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7695;ap&#772;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
