In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet is imprisoned, and Jerusalem is under siege by the Babylonians. Despite the dire circumstances, God invites Jeremiah to call upon Him, highlighting the accessibility of God even in times of distress. This invitation to prayer is consistent with other biblical teachings, such as <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, where God encourages His people to call upon Him in times of trouble. It underscores the relational aspect of God, who desires to be sought after and engaged with by His people.<p><b>and I will answer</b><br>God's promise to answer is a reassurance of His faithfulness and attentiveness to the prayers of His people. This assurance is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>, where believers are reminded that if they ask anything according to His will, He hears them. The historical context of Jeremiah's time, with the impending destruction of Jerusalem, makes this promise particularly poignant, as it offers hope and certainty amidst uncertainty. It reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to respond to the needs and cries of His people.<p><b>and show you great and unsearchable things</b><br>The "great and unsearchable things" refer to the profound and hidden truths that God is willing to reveal. In the context of Jeremiah, this includes the future restoration of Israel and the coming of the Messiah, which are beyond human understanding and planning. The term "unsearchable" suggests things that are inaccessible or fortified, indicating that only God can provide insight into these mysteries. This aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than human thoughts and ways. It points to the divine wisdom and knowledge that surpass human comprehension.<p><b>you do not know</b><br>This phrase acknowledges human limitations in understanding God's plans and purposes. It serves as a reminder of the finite nature of human wisdom compared to God's infinite knowledge. In the broader biblical narrative, this humility before God's omniscience is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38-41</a>, where God questions Job to illustrate the vastness of divine wisdom. For Jeremiah, this revelation would include the eventual return from exile and the establishment of a new covenant, which were beyond the immediate perception of the people. It emphasizes the need for reliance on God's revelation rather than human insight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

It must be admitted that this introduction hardly corresponds to the sequel, which does not contain any special secrets, as we should have thought. Either vers. 2, 3 have been inserted by a later (inspired) editor, whose mind was absorbed in high thoughts of the latter days - for this view may be urged the style and phraseology, which are hardly those of the surrounding chapters, hardly those of Jeremiah; or else we must adopt Hengstenberg's perhaps over subtle suggestion, which, however, does not touch the question of the phraseology, "that throughout Scripture dead knowledge is not regarded as knowledge; that the hope of restoration had, in the natural man, in the prophet, as well as in all believers, an enemy who strove to darken and extinguish it; that therefore it was ever new," or, in the words of Jeremiah, "great and secret things, which thou knowest not." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Call</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
