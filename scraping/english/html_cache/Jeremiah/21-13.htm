In the context of Jeremiah, God often speaks against the leaders and people of Judah due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry. This divine opposition is a serious matter, as it signifies that the people have moved beyond mere disobedience to a point where God Himself is actively working against them. This echoes other instances in the Bible where God opposes the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>who dwell above the valley</b><br>This refers to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, which is situated on a series of hills and surrounded by valleys. The geographical setting of Jerusalem gave its inhabitants a sense of security, as the valleys provided natural defenses against invaders. However, this phrase suggests that their physical location has led to a false sense of security, ignoring the spiritual and moral decay within.<p><b>atop the rocky plateau</b><br>The rocky plateau further emphasizes the natural fortifications of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence supports the strategic advantage of Jerusalem's topography, which made it difficult for enemies to conquer. Despite this, the phrase serves as a reminder that physical defenses are meaningless without God's protection, as seen in other biblical narratives like the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the message. When God declares something, it is not merely a prediction but a statement of what will surely come to pass. This is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to affirm the divine origin of the message.<p><b>you who say, &#8220;Who can come against us?</b><br>This reflects the arrogance and complacency of the people of Jerusalem. They believed their city was impregnable due to its fortifications and perhaps their status as God's chosen people. This attitude is reminiscent of other biblical instances where human pride leads to downfall, such as the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><b>Who can enter our dwellings?&#8221;</b><br>The rhetorical question highlights the false confidence of the people in their security. Historically, Jerusalem had withstood many sieges, which may have contributed to this overconfidence. However, the prophetic message warns that no earthly defense can stand against God's judgment. This serves as a reminder of the need for humility and reliance on God rather than on human strength or achievements.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_dweller.htm">Valley Dweller</a></b><br>Refers to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, which is situated in a valley surrounded by hills, symbolizing a false sense of security.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rocky_plain.htm">Rocky Plain</a></b><br>A metaphor for the fortified city of Jerusalem, emphasizing its perceived impregnability.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is declaring His opposition to the pride and false security of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom and its capital, facing impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/false_security.htm">False Security</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem believed their city was invincible due to its geographical and man-made defenses.

What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?">Isaiah 22:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-5.htm" title="For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.">Isaiah 22:5</a>), the Tyrop?on of Josephus.

The king and his people trusted, as the Jebusites had done of old (<a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>), in what seemed to them the impregnable strength of their natural position. There seems no adequate reason for taking the words as symbolising the kingly house of Judah, but it is probable enough that local associations, palaces on the hill or in the valley, may have given the words a specially pointed application.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - Jehovah, standing, as it were, on the Mount of Olives, addresses the proud city beneath him. <span class="cmt_word">O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain</span>; rather, <span class="accented">O inhabitress</span>; Jerusalem is personified as a virgin. The poetical description of the capital as a "valley" (the word, however, signifies a valley as wide as a plain) reminds us of "the valley [or rather, 'ravine'] of vision" (<a href="/isaiah/22-1.htm">Isaiah 22:1, 5</a>); While "the rock of the plain" recalls "my mountain in the field" (<a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>). So, as Graf points out, Babylon is called "a mountain" in metaphorical language (<a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). It is, however, singular that the prophet should call Jerusalem a "valley" and a "rock" in the same passage. In the former, perhaps, Jeremiah is thinking specially of the lower city, and in the latter of Mount Zion. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall come down against us</span>? viz. from the "hills round about Jerusalem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
