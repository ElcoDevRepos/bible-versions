His response is not from personal opinion but as a mouthpiece for God, emphasizing the divine authority behind his words.<p><b>&#8220;You are to tell Zedekiah that&#8221;</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from Babylon. Jeremiah's instruction to convey a message to Zedekiah highlights the prophet's role as an intermediary between God and the king. This reflects the biblical theme of God communicating with leaders through prophets. Zedekiah's request for guidance from Jeremiah shows his desperation as Babylon threatened Jerusalem, yet his actions often contradicted the prophetic counsel he received. This situation underscores the tension between divine will and human leadership, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
