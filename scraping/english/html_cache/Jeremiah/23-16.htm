This title underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to execute judgment and deliverance. It is a reminder of His ultimate authority over all creation, including the prophets and their messages.<p><b>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.</b><br>Here, the instruction is clear: the people are warned against heeding the false prophets. In the historical context, many prophets in Judah were claiming to speak for God, but their messages contradicted the true words of God delivered through Jeremiah. This reflects a common biblical theme where true and false prophets are distinguished by their adherence to God's word.<p><b>They are filling you with false hopes.</b><br>The false prophets were offering messages of peace and prosperity, which were contrary to the impending judgment that God had declared through Jeremiah. This phrase highlights the danger of false assurance and the importance of discerning truth from deception. It serves as a warning against complacency and the allure of comforting lies.<p><b>They speak visions from their own minds,</b><br>This indicates that the false prophets were not receiving divine revelation but were instead concocting messages based on their own thoughts and desires. This self-originated prophecy contrasts with true prophecy, which is divinely inspired. It underscores the human tendency to create messages that align with personal or popular desires rather than God's will.<p><b>not from the mouth of the LORD.</b><br>The ultimate test of a prophet's message is whether it originates from God. This phrase emphasizes the necessity of divine origin for true prophecy. It also points to the importance of Scripture as the authoritative word of God, against which all teachings and prophecies must be measured.
