Biblically, the number ten often represents completeness or a period of testing, as seen in the Ten Commandments or the ten plagues of Egypt. This waiting period may have been a test of the people's patience and faith, reflecting their willingness to trust in God's timing rather than their own.<p><b>the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the message Jeremiah is about to deliver. In the Old Testament, "the word of the LORD" is a common expression indicating a direct communication from God, often through His prophets. It underscores the authority and reliability of the message, distinguishing it from human opinion or advice. The word of the LORD is living and active, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, and is central to the prophetic ministry.<p><b>came to Jeremiah</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," was chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah. His role as a prophet was to be a mouthpiece for God, often delivering messages of warning, judgment, and hope.

It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
