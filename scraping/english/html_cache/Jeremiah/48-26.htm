In biblical literature, drunkenness often represents a state of disorientation and vulnerability (<a href="/isaiah/51-21.htm">Isaiah 51:21-23</a>). It signifies the loss of control and impending downfall. The imagery of drunkenness is used to depict how Moab will be overwhelmed by divine judgment, unable to stand against the consequences of their actions.<p><b>because he has magnified himself against the LORD</b><br>Moab's sin is rooted in pride and arrogance, as they have exalted themselves against God. This echoes the broader biblical theme where pride precedes destruction (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Moab's self-exaltation is a direct affront to God's sovereignty, similar to the pride of other nations like Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>). This prideful attitude leads to their downfall, as God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p><b>so Moab will wallow in his own vomit</b><br>This graphic imagery illustrates the disgrace and humiliation that Moab will experience as a result of their pride. The act of wallowing in vomit signifies a complete reversal of fortune and dignity, highlighting the depth of their shame. It serves as a metaphor for the consequences of sin, where the sinner is left to face the repulsive results of their actions (<a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>).<p><b>and he will also become a laughingstock</b><br>Moab's downfall will be so severe that they will become an object of ridicule among the nations. This fulfills the biblical principle that those who exalt themselves will be humbled (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The concept of becoming a laughingstock is a common theme in prophetic literature, where nations that defy God are brought low and mocked by others (<a href="/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6-7</a>). It underscores the ultimate futility of opposing God's will and the inevitable triumph of His justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon the nations, including Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

At an earlier point the prophet said that it was the callousness produced by long prosperity (ver. 11); but here another sin is mentioned - Moab's haughty contempt of Jehovah.
