In the context of Jeremiah, God often speaks through the prophet to deliver messages of judgment or hope. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, reminding the audience of His faithfulness and their obligations.<p><b>You have not obeyed Me;</b><br>This highlights the disobedience of the people of Judah. Historically, this refers to their failure to follow God's commands, particularly regarding the release of Hebrew slaves as stipulated in the Law of Moses (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>). Their disobedience is a recurring theme in Jeremiah, reflecting a broader pattern of covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>you have not proclaimed freedom, each man for his brother and for his neighbor.</b><br>This phrase refers to the specific command to release Hebrew slaves during the Year of Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>). The failure to proclaim freedom symbolizes a deeper social injustice and neglect of God's law. It also reflects a lack of compassion and community responsibility, which were central to the covenantal life of Israel.<p><b>So now I proclaim freedom for you, declares the LORD&#8212;</b><br>Here, God turns the tables, using irony to declare a "freedom" that is actually a judgment. This freedom is not liberation but a release into the consequences of their actions. It underscores the principle of divine justice, where God allows people to experience the results of their choices.<p><b>freedom to fall by sword, by plague, and by famine!</b><br>These three forms of judgment&#8212;sword, plague, and famine&#8212;are common in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>) and represent comprehensive devastation. They are often seen as instruments of divine wrath, used to bring about repentance or to execute judgment. This triad of calamities reflects the severity of the consequences for breaking the covenant.<p><b>I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of Judah's impending judgment, serving as a warning to other nations. The term "horror" suggests a spectacle of devastation that would cause fear and astonishment among other peoples. It also fulfills the prophetic warnings given earlier in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>), where the consequences of disobedience would serve as a lesson to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah, expressing His judgment on the people for their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivers God's message to the people of Judah, warning them of the consequences of their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The recipients of God's message through Jeremiah, who failed to obey God's command to proclaim freedom to their fellow Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The impending event that serves as the backdrop for this prophecy, where Judah would face conquest and exile due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sword,_plague,_and_famine.htm">Sword, Plague, and Famine</a></b><br>The forms of judgment that God declares as a consequence of Judah's failure to obey His command.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>God's commands are not optional; they are integral to living a life that honors Him.
