The term "horror" suggests a state of shock and fear that will be so severe it will serve as a warning to other nations. This reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>, where disobedience to God would result in becoming "an object of horror" among the nations. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled when Judah was conquered by Babylon, leading to the exile. The scattering of the Jewish people served as a testament to the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did in Jerusalem</b><br>Manasseh's reign is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33</a>, where he is described as one of the most wicked kings of Judah. He reversed the religious reforms of his father Hezekiah, reintroducing idolatry and even practicing child sacrifice. His actions led to spiritual and moral decay in Jerusalem, provoking God's wrath. The reference to Manasseh highlights the long-lasting impact of a leader's sin on a nation. This serves as a reminder of the importance of godly leadership and the severe consequences of leading a nation into sin. Manasseh's actions are a type of antichrist, opposing the ways of God, contrasting with the righteous reign of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

He is not merely predicting events; He is declaring what He will personally bring to pass. Scripture consistently presents God as actively shaping the destiny of nations (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). Judah&#8217;s fate, therefore, will not be a historical accident but the outworking of divine justice.<p>Key truth:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty means He both blesses and disciplines (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal to heed repeated warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/15-1.htm">Jeremiah 15:1-3</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>) moves His hand from patient mercy to decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a horror</b><p>The word paints a picture of something so shocking that others recoil. Judah, once the apple of God&#8217;s eye, will become an object lesson of dread (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-9.htm">Jeremiah 24:9</a>). Instead of inspiring admiration for her covenant privileges, she will inspire shuddering over her downfall.<p>What the &#8220;horror&#8221; looked like:<p>&#8226; Siege, famine, sword, and exile (<a href="/jeremiah/15-2.htm">Jeremiah 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The land left desolate, cities burned (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Survivors scattered, carrying the story of ruin wherever they went (<a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to all the kingdoms of the earth</b><p>The punishment will be so severe that every surrounding nation&#8212;and even distant kingdoms&#8212;will hear and tremble (<a href="/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>). God&#8217;s dealings with Judah serve as a global testimony that He judges sin impartially (<a href="/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9-11</a>). What unfolds in Jerusalem will echo from Babylon to Egypt and beyond, reinforcing the universal moral order God has established.<p>Takeaway:<p>&#8226; National sin has international repercussions (<a href="/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God intends the spectacle of judgment to warn every nation, including ours, that divine standards do not change (<a href="/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of what Manasseh son of Hezekiah king of Judah did</b><p>The Lord traces Judah&#8217;s catastrophe back to the reign of Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-16</a>). Though later kings bore responsibility for their own choices, Manasseh&#8217;s long rule embedded idolatry so deeply that the nation never fully recovered.<p>Manasseh&#8217;s offenses included:<p>&#8226; Rebuilding high places and altars to Baal (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Placing pagan altars in the temple itself (v. 4-5).<p>&#8226; Practicing witchcraft, divination, and child sacrifice&#8212;&#8220;he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood&#8221; (v. 6, 16).<p>Cross references underline the lasting stain of his reign (<a href="/jeremiah/32-31.htm">Jeremiah 32:31-35</a>). Though Manasseh personally humbled himself late in life (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>), the systemic corruption he set in motion continued, showing how leadership can mark a nation for generations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in Jerusalem</b><p>The city that housed God&#8217;s Name (<a href="/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>) became the epicenter of rebellion. Defilement in the very place chosen for His dwelling magnified the offense (<a href="/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3-6</a>). Because sin occurred &#8220;in Jerusalem,&#8221; judgment would also be showcased there&#8212;faithful to the principle that privilege heightens accountability (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>Highlights:<p>&#8226; Temple desecration made the holy precincts a staging ground for idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The very streets where God&#8217;s law was to be celebrated echoed with injustice and bloodshed (<a href="/jeremiah/7-8.htm">Jeremiah 7:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore the city would witness siege walls, starvation, and exile firsthand (<a href="/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a> teaches that the Lord, in righteous sovereignty, would turn Judah into a shocking object lesson for every nation because King Manasseh&#8217;s deep-seated idolatry had poisoned the heart of Jerusalem. The verse confirms that God&#8217;s judgments are purposeful, proportional, and publicly instructive. Privilege invites greater responsibility; persistent defiance invites catastrophic discipline. Yet even in judgment, the narrative urges every generation to heed God&#8217;s voice, turn from sin, and walk in the covenant blessings He stands ready to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Manasseh the son of Hezekiah.</span>--The horror of that long and evil reign still lingered in the minds of men, and the prophet saw in it the beginning of the evils from which his people were now suffering.
