In the context of Babylon, it may refer to the pride and arrogance of the Babylonians, who were known for their opulence and excess. The imagery of being "flushed with heat" can also symbolize the fervor of their idolatrous practices and indulgence in sin, which ultimately leads to their downfall.<p><b>I will serve them a feast</b><br>The feast here is symbolic of God's judgment. In ancient Near Eastern culture, feasts were often associated with celebration and abundance, but in this context, it is a feast of divine retribution. This imagery is reminiscent of the "cup of wrath" found in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, where God makes nations drink from the cup of His anger.<p><b>and I will make them drunk</b><br>Drunkenness in the Bible often symbolizes a loss of control and impending judgment. Here, it signifies the Babylonians' inability to discern or escape the judgment that God is bringing upon them. This is similar to the imagery used in <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9-10</a>, where spiritual blindness and stupor are consequences of rejecting God.<p><b>so that they may revel</b><br>Reveling indicates a false sense of security and joy. The Babylonians are depicted as being unaware of their impending doom, indulging in their pleasures without realizing that their time is short. This mirrors the warning in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, where sudden destruction comes upon those who are saying, "Peace and safety."<p><b>then they will fall asleep forever and never wake up</b><br>This phrase signifies the finality of God's judgment. The "sleep" here is a metaphor for death, indicating that the Babylonians will be utterly destroyed and will not rise again. This is consistent with the theme of Babylon's ultimate downfall as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon the Great falls and is no more.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This statement underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is a divine pronouncement, emphasizing that the judgment is not merely a human prediction but a decree from God Himself. This assurance is a common feature in prophetic literature, affirming that God's word will be fulfilled, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word does not return void.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire that is the subject of God's judgment in <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>.
