The scroll likely contained the words of Jeremiah, dictated to Baruch, as a warning to King Jehoiakim and the people of Judah. The columns refer to sections of the scroll, which were read aloud in the presence of the king. This act of reading signifies the delivery of God's message, emphasizing the importance of hearing and responding to divine warnings. The number "three or four" suggests a partial reading, indicating that the king did not allow the full message to be heard.<p><b>Jehoiakim would cut them off with a scribe&#8217;s knife</b><br>King Jehoiakim's action of cutting the scroll with a scribe's knife is symbolic of his rejection of God's word. The scribe's knife, typically used for preparing and maintaining writing materials, becomes an instrument of destruction. This act of cutting signifies a deliberate and contemptuous rejection of the prophetic message. Jehoiakim's response contrasts with the expected reverence for sacred texts, highlighting his defiance against God's authority.<p><b>and throw them into the firepot</b><br>The firepot, used for warmth in the winter, becomes the means of destroying the scroll. This act of burning the scroll represents an attempt to obliterate the message and silence the prophet. In biblical times, fire often symbolizes judgment and purification, but here it is used to demonstrate the king's disdain for divine instruction. The destruction of the scroll is a futile attempt to negate God's word, which cannot be extinguished by human actions.<p><b>until the entire scroll had been consumed by the fire</b><br>The complete consumption of the scroll by fire signifies the total rejection of God's message by Jehoiakim. This act of destruction is not only a personal affront to Jeremiah and Baruch but also an affront to God Himself. The historical context reveals the king's disregard for prophetic warnings, which ultimately leads to the downfall of Judah. This event foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, as prophesied by Jeremiah. The indestructibility of God's word is later affirmed when Jeremiah is instructed to rewrite the scroll, demonstrating that divine truth endures despite human opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his rebellion against God's word and his disregard for the prophetic messages delivered by Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe, who wrote down the words of the prophecy as dictated by Jeremiah and read them to the people and officials.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehudi.htm">Jehudi</a></b><br>A court official who read the scroll to King Jehoiakim, acting as a messenger of the prophetic word.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>The written record of Jeremiah's prophecies, which was meant to be a warning to the people of Judah about the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_rejection_of_god's_word.htm">The Rejection of God's Word</a></b><br>Jehoiakim's act of cutting and burning the scroll symbolizes a deliberate rejection of God's message.

The act, in its childish impatience, betrayed the anger of the king. He could not bear to hear of the seventy years of exile which were in store for his people, and which, if we assume the roll to have included the substance of Jeremiah 25, would have come into one of the earlier columns. The word for "pen-knife" is used generally for any sharp instrument of iron--for a razor (<a href="/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1</a>), and for a sword (<a href="/isaiah/7-20.htm" title="In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.">Isaiah 7:20</a>). Here it is the knife which was used to shape the reed, or <span class= "ital">calamus, </span>used in writing. It should, perhaps, be noted that the Hebrew, like the English, leaves it uncertain whether the king himself cut and burnt the roll, or Jehudi with his approval. <a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a> is in favour of the former view.
