In the context of ancient Israel, a house was not just a physical structure but a symbol of family stability and heritage. The loss of one's home would have been seen as a severe punishment and a sign of God's displeasure. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to losing one's home to foreigners. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian invasion when the Israelites were exiled, and their properties were occupied by others.<p><b>their fields and wives as well</b><br>Fields were a primary source of livelihood in agrarian societies, and losing them meant economic ruin. The mention of wives being turned over to others underscores the complete upheaval of social and family structures. This reflects the severity of the judgment, as it disrupts the very fabric of community life. The loss of fields and wives is reminiscent of the curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience results in losing one's land and family. This also foreshadows the Babylonian conquest, where the invaders took possession of the land and disrupted families.<p><b>for I will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land,&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "stretch out My hand" is a biblical idiom for executing judgment or power. It is used in <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a> when God promises to stretch out His hand against Egypt. This indicates a direct and active intervention by God in the affairs of the people, emphasizing His sovereignty and the certainty of the coming judgment. The "inhabitants of the land" refers to the people of Judah, who were living in disobedience to God's covenant. This phrase underscores the seriousness of their sin and the inevitability of divine retribution.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase affirms the authority and certainty of the message. When the LORD declares something, it is a divine pronouncement that will surely come to pass. It emphasizes that the prophecy is not merely the words of Jeremiah but the authoritative word of God. This assurance of fulfillment is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where God's declarations are seen as unchangeable and certain, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is said to accomplish what He desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
