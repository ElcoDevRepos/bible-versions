The "mother of seven" symbolizes completeness and abundance. However, her growing faint indicates a reversal of fortune, suggesting judgment and calamity. This imagery reflects the dire consequences of Israel's disobedience and the impending judgment upon the nation.<p><b>she will breathe her last breath.</b><br>This phrase signifies death and the end of life. It underscores the severity of the judgment that is to come. The imagery of a mother, a life-giver, breathing her last breath, highlights the totality of the devastation that will befall the people. It serves as a metaphor for the nation's demise due to their unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>Her sun will set while it is still day;</b><br>The setting of the sun while it is still day symbolizes untimely disaster and unexpected calamity. In biblical literature, light often represents life and blessing, while darkness signifies judgment and death (<a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). This phrase indicates that the judgment will come suddenly and prematurely, cutting off the people in their prime.<p><b>she will be disgraced and humiliated.</b><br>Disgrace and humiliation were severe consequences in the honor-shame culture of the ancient Near East. This phrase indicates the loss of status and respect, both personally and nationally. It reflects the shame that comes from being defeated and exiled, as Israel would experience at the hands of their enemies.<p><b>And the rest I will put to the sword in the presence of their enemies,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the completeness of the judgment. The sword is a common biblical symbol for war and destruction (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). The presence of enemies suggests that the judgment will be public and witnessed by those who oppose Israel, adding to the nation's shame and suffering.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. It is a divine pronouncement, underscoring that the judgment is not merely a natural consequence but a direct act of God in response to the people's covenant unfaithfulness. The use of "declares the LORD" affirms the prophetic nature of the message, ensuring its fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mother_of_seven.htm">The Mother of Seven</a></b><br>A symbolic figure representing the nation of Judah or Jerusalem, often seen as a mother to its people.

Believers are reminded to live in readiness and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_amidst_judgment.htm">Hope Amidst Judgment</a></b><br>Even in the declaration of judgment, there is an implicit call to repentance. God's desire is for His people to turn back to Him and avoid the impending consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_remnant.htm">The Role of the Remnant</a></b><br>The concept of a remnant highlights God's faithfulness to His covenant promises. Despite judgment, God preserves a remnant, offering hope for future restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_humility.htm">The Importance of Humility</a></b><br>The disgrace and humiliation mentioned serve as a reminder of the need for humility before God.
