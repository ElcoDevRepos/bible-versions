The destruction of Moab is a fulfillment of prophecy against a nation that had been a persistent adversary of Israel. This phrase indicates a complete overthrow, aligning with earlier prophecies in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a> and <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>. The destruction serves as a divine judgment for Moab's pride and idolatry.<p><b>and its towns have been invaded;</b><br>The invasion of Moab's towns suggests a comprehensive military campaign, likely by the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar. This reflects the historical context of Babylon's expansion and dominance in the region during the 6th century BC. The invasion signifies the loss of security and autonomy for Moab, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment.<p><b>the best of its young men have gone down in the slaughter,</b><br>The phrase highlights the loss of Moab's strength and future, as young men represent both military power and the continuation of the nation. This slaughter is a direct consequence of divine judgment, reminiscent of similar judgments on other nations, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a> regarding Babylon. It underscores the futility of relying on human strength against God's decrees.<p><b>declares the King,</b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority over all nations, including Moab. It reflects the biblical theme of God as the ultimate ruler, as seen in Psalms 47:7-8. The use of "King" here contrasts with earthly kings, highlighting the divine origin of the judgment.<p><b>whose name is the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The "LORD of Hosts" is a title that underscores God's supreme power and command over heavenly armies. It is frequently used in the Old Testament to convey God's might and ability to execute judgment (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).

It is even doubtful whether it can be translated at all consistently with grammar, though Hitzig, a good grammarian, has adopted the suggestion of Grotius, rendering, "and her cities have gone up," <span class="accented">viz. in smoke, i.e.</span> they have been burnt; comp. <a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, the end of which verso ought to run thus: "The whole city went up to heaven." But even if the verb in third masc. sing. be allowable after the plural noun, it is very harsh to give it such an interpretation, when the context says nothing about fire or smoke. J.D. Michaelis and Ewald, therefore, propose to change the vowel points of the first word, rendering, "The spoiler of Moab and of her cities is gone up;" and Dr. Payne Smith inclines to follow them.
