In biblical times, an oath sworn by oneself, especially by God, indicated an unbreakable promise. This reflects God's sovereignty and His ultimate authority. The use of "declares the LORD" underscores the divine origin of the message, affirming that it is not merely a human prediction but a divine decree. This is reminiscent of other instances where God swears by Himself, such as in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a> and <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, highlighting the unchangeable nature of His promises.<p><b>that Bozrah will become a desolation</b><br>Bozrah was a major city in Edom, a nation often in conflict with Israel. The prophecy of desolation indicates complete destruction and abandonment. Historically, Edom was known for its pride and hostility towards Israel, as seen in <a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>. The desolation of Bozrah serves as a judgment against Edom's arrogance and betrayal. Archaeological evidence suggests that Bozrah was a significant urban center, making its desolation a powerful symbol of divine judgment.<p><b>a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse</b><br>These terms collectively emphasize the totality of the judgment. "Disgrace" indicates a loss of honor and respect, "ruin" suggests physical destruction, and "curse" implies divine disfavor. This triad of terms is often used in prophetic literature to convey the severity of God's judgment. The language echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience to God's covenant, reinforcing the idea that Edom's fate is a result of its actions against God's people.<p><b>and all her cities will be in ruins forever</b><br>The phrase "in ruins forever" suggests a permanent state of destruction, indicating that Edom's cities will not be rebuilt. This eternal aspect of the prophecy highlights the finality of God's judgment. Historically, Edom was eventually conquered and absorbed by other nations, fulfilling this prophecy. The mention of "all her cities" suggests that the judgment is comprehensive, affecting the entire nation. This can be seen as a type of the ultimate judgment that will come upon all nations that oppose God's will, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.
