This timeframe is significant as it represents a complete cycle of judgment and restoration. The number seventy often symbolizes completeness in biblical numerology. This prophecy was fulfilled historically when the Jews returned to Jerusalem under the decree of Cyrus the Great, as recorded in <a href="/ezra/1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>. The seventy years also align with the sabbatical years that the land of Israel was to enjoy rest, as mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34-35</a>.<p><b>I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation</b><br>The punishment of Babylon and its king, likely referring to Nebuchadnezzar and his successors, is a divine retribution for their role in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, as well as their oppression of God's people. This prophecy was fulfilled when the Medes and Persians, led by Cyrus, conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This event is also recorded in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>, where the fall of Babylon is depicted during the reign of Belshazzar.<p><b>the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt</b><br>The Chaldeans were a Semitic people who became the ruling class in Babylon. Their guilt refers to their idolatry, pride, and cruelty, as well as their desecration of the temple and the holy vessels of God. The judgment against them is consistent with God's justice, as seen in other prophetic books like <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2.htm">Habakkuk 2</a>, which also pronounce woes upon Babylon for its sins.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the prophecy. It is a reminder that the words spoken are not merely Jeremiah's but are the direct revelation from God. This divine declaration assures the fulfillment of the prophecy, as God's word does not return void (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and I will make it an everlasting desolation</b><br>The term "everlasting desolation" signifies a complete and enduring judgment. Historically, Babylon did become a desolate ruin, as prophesied. Although the city was once a center of power and culture, it eventually fell into decline and was abandoned. This desolation serves as a type of the final judgment and the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over the kingdoms of this world, as seen in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>, where Babylon is used symbolically to represent the fall of worldly powers opposed to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>Refers to the ruler of Babylon, a powerful empire that conquered Judah and took its people into exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth and power, which played a significant role in the history of Israel and Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/chaldeans.htm">Chaldeans</a></b><br>A people group within Babylon, often synonymous with the Babylonians, known for their influence and military prowess.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventy_years.htm">Seventy Years</a></b><br>A prophetic period during which Judah would be in exile in Babylon, symbolizing a complete and divinely appointed time of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God's control over nations and history is evident as He uses Babylon to discipline Judah and then holds Babylon accountable for its own sins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_promises.htm">The Certainty of God's Promises</a></b><br>The seventy-year prophecy underscores that God's word is reliable and will come to pass, encouraging believers to trust in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Babylon's eventual desolation serves as a warning that sin and pride lead to downfall, urging individuals and nations to seek righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>While judgment is pronounced, the completion of seventy years also points to God's plan for restoration and hope for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophecy.htm">The Role of Prophecy</a></b><br>Understanding biblical prophecy helps believers discern God's plans and purposes, encouraging a life aligned with His will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_25_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 25:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_12_God_s_justice_on_Babylon.htm">How does Jeremiah 25:12 demonstrate God's justice against Babylon's actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_divine_retribution_in_Jer_25_12.htm">What lessons on divine retribution can we learn from Jeremiah 25:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_12_and_God_s_promises_link.htm">How does Jeremiah 25:12 connect with God's promises in other scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_God_s_timing_in_life.htm">How can we apply the concept of God's timing from Jeremiah 25:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_12_Consequences_for_nations.htm">What does Jeremiah 25:12 teach about consequences for nations opposing God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_12_on_God_s_justice.htm">What does Jeremiah 25:12 reveal about God's justice and punishment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_25_12_and_divine_retribution.htm">How does Jeremiah 25:12 align with the concept of divine retribution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Babylon_punished_in_Jeremiah_25_12.htm">Why did God choose Babylon for punishment in Jeremiah 25:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_babylon_inhabited_post-destruction.htm">Jeremiah 25:12 foretells Babylon becoming a perpetual desolation, yet archaeological evidence shows later habitation; how do we explain this?

That we can understand well enough, if it was meant only for the initiated, but it is not easy to see why the same prophetic discourse should contain both the veiled and the open prediction. On the relation of the LXX. version to the Hebrew, see <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-29.</span> - The judgment upon Judah and the nations. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Perpetual desolations</span>. Thus, too, we read in <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>, that Babylon "shall never be inhabited." There is a dispute between Dr. Keith and Dr. Kay on the one side, and rationalistic commentators (e.g. Kuenen) on the other, whether these prophecies have received a circumstantial fulfillment. The truth is that authorities are not entirely agreed on the area covered by the site of Babylon. General Chesney remarks that, so far from being uninhabited, "A town of considerable population, villages, date groves, and gardens, are found still on the very site of ancient Babylon" (extracts from a private letter in B. W. Newton's 'Babylon: its Revival and Final Desolation,' pp. 38-42). Similarly M. Menant, a veteran French Assyriologist, remarks that "Hillah, according to M. Oppert, was a quarter of Babylon, probably that which was inhabited by the working population, without the precincts of the royal palaces. Numberless traces of ancient habitations indicate this origin of the modern town" ('Babylone,' p. 177). Mr. George Smith, however, in his 'Assyrian Discoveries,' simply states that, "A little to the south rose the town of Hillah," apparently assuming (what is impossible to prove, as the walls of Babylon have not yet been discovered) that Hillah lay just outside the city enclosure. But even he adds that it was "built with the bricks found in the old capital," which is, strictly speaking, inconsistent with the absolute abandonment of the site of Babylon implied in <a href="/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>. The dispute is an unfortunate one, as it tacitly implies that circumstantial fulfillments are necessary to the veracity of prophecy. The truth seems to lie in the mean between two opposing views. As a rule, the details of a prophetic description cannot be pressed; they are mainly imaginative elaborations of a great central truth or fact. Occasionally, however, regarding the prophecies in the light of gospel times, it is almost impossible not to observe that "the Spirit of Christ which was in" the prophets (<a href="/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>) has overruled their expressions, so that they correspond more closely to facts than could have been reasonably anticipated. Such superabundant favors to believers in inspiration occur repeatedly in the prophecies respecting Christ. They may, of course, occur elsewhere for a sufficient reason, but we have no right to be surprised if we do not meet with them. The general truth of the prophecy is that the <span class="accented">empire of Babylon</span> shall fall forever. As Dr. Payne Smith remarks, it was practically the work of one man (Nebuchadnezzar), and after his death it only lasted for a few years, during which its history is a series of murders and usurpations. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
