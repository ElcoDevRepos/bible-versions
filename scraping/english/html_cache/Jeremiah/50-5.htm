Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, represents the spiritual center for the Israelites. Historically, Zion was the location of the Temple, the dwelling place of God among His people. This longing to return to Zion reflects a repentance and a turning away from idolatry and sin. It echoes the call in <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, where nations are drawn to the mountain of the Lord to learn His ways.<p><b>and turn their faces toward it.</b><br>Turning one's face toward Zion signifies a deliberate and intentional decision to seek God and His ways. This act of turning is symbolic of repentance, a common theme in the prophetic books. It suggests a reorientation of life and priorities, aligning oneself with God's purposes. In the context of the Babylonian exile, this turning back to Zion represents hope and restoration, as seen in <a href="/psalms/126.htm">Psalm 126:1</a>, where the return from captivity is likened to a dream fulfilled.<p><b>They will come and join themselves to the LORD</b><br>This phrase speaks to a covenantal relationship, where the people commit themselves to God. The idea of joining oneself to the Lord is reminiscent of the covenant language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>, where Israel is called to fear, serve, and hold fast to God. It implies a deep, personal commitment and loyalty, akin to the marriage covenant, which is a recurring metaphor for God's relationship with His people (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19-20</a>).<p><b>in an everlasting covenant</b><br>The everlasting covenant refers to the unbreakable promise between God and His people. This covenant is not new but a renewal and fulfillment of the promises made to Abraham, Moses, and David. It points to the New Covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people. This covenant is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice establishes an eternal relationship with God (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>that will never be forgotten.</b><br>This assurance of a covenant that will never be forgotten highlights God's faithfulness and the permanence of His promises. Unlike human covenants, which can be broken, God's covenant is eternal and unchanging. This phrase reassures the people of God's enduring commitment to them, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>, where God promises that His covenant of peace will not be removed. It underscores the hope and security found in God's unchanging nature and His steadfast love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A
