His secretive oath to Jeremiah highlights the political tension and fear of public opinion. Zedekiah's clandestine actions reflect his weak leadership and fear of his officials, who opposed Jeremiah's prophecies. This secrecy contrasts with the boldness of prophets like Jeremiah, who openly declared God's messages despite personal risk.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us this life&#8221;</b><br>The invocation of the LORD's name in an oath underscores the seriousness and solemnity of Zedekiah's promise. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of swearing by a deity to affirm truthfulness. The phrase acknowledges God as the giver of life, a common biblical theme (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>). This acknowledgment of God's sovereignty is ironic, given Zedekiah's general disobedience to God's commands through Jeremiah.<p><b>I will not kill you</b><br>Zedekiah's promise not to kill Jeremiah is significant, as it shows his recognition of Jeremiah's prophetic authority, despite his reluctance to heed his warnings. This assurance of safety is crucial, given the hostile environment Jeremiah faced, including imprisonment and threats from officials (<a href="/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Jeremiah 37:15-16</a>). It reflects the tension between Zedekiah's fear of his officials and his awareness of Jeremiah's divine mission.<p><b>nor will I deliver you into the hands of these men who are seeking your life.&#8221;</b><br>The "men who are seeking your life" refers to the princes and officials of Judah who viewed Jeremiah as a traitor for his prophecies of Jerusalem's fall (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>). Zedekiah's promise to protect Jeremiah from them highlights the prophet's precarious position and the king's internal conflict. This protection is a temporary reprieve, as Zedekiah's eventual capture by the Babylonians fulfills Jeremiah's prophecies, demonstrating the futility of resisting God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.

Like Nicodemus visiting Jesus by night (<a href="/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1&#8211;2</a>), Zedekiah wants spiritual counsel without public cost, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>, &#8220;The fear of man is a snare.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

This common oath formula (<a href="/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>) ties the promise to God&#8217;s own unchanging life.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a> notes that people swear by someone greater; Zedekiah invokes the highest authority, underscoring the seriousness of his words even while he wavers in courage.<p>&#8226; By rooting the oath in the Lord&#8217;s life, he implicitly acknowledges God&#8217;s supremacy over earthly kings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has given us this life</b><p>&#8226; The king confesses that every breath is a gift from God (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>), an echo of <a href="/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>: &#8220;In His hand is the life of every creature.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such a confession should have led him to obey God&#8217;s prophetic word without hesitation, yet his later actions show the difference between verbal assent and heartfelt submission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not kill you</b><p>&#8226; Zedekiah vows personal restraint, promising he himself will not execute Jeremiah.<p>&#8226; The promise mirrors the earlier protection Jeremiah received from Ahikam (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>) and points to God&#8217;s ongoing shield around His servant, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/105-14.htm">Psalm 105:14</a>, &#8220;He permitted no man to oppress them.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

themes embodied in Jeremiah&#8217;s preservation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/38-16.htm">Jeremiah 38:16</a> captures a conflicted king swearing a secret oath that acknowledges God&#8217;s sovereignty yet reveals his fear of men. By invoking the living LORD who gives life, Zedekiah vows not to harm Jeremiah nor surrender him to murderous officials. The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s ultimate control over rulers and events.<p>&#8226; The sacred weight of oaths made in God&#8217;s name.<p>&#8226; The divine protection granted to faithful servants amid opposition.<p>Though Zedekiah&#8217;s courage falters later, this moment affirms that the Lord&#8217;s word through Jeremiah will not be silenced, and His purposes will prevail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul.</span>--The formula of the oath was obviously intended to be one of unusual solemnity; more so even than the simpler form of "The Lord liveth" (<a href="/context/jeremiah/16-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD lives, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 16:14-15</a>). The king swears by Jehovah as the living God, author and giver of his own life. The two-fold promise shows that the king felt the implied reproof of Jeremiah's question. He separates himself from those who sought the prophet's life, and declares that for the future he will not give them even the sanction of acquiescence.
