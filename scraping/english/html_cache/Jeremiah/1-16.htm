The context is the impending judgment on Judah due to their disobedience. The Hebrew word for "judgments" can also mean "verdicts" or "sentences," emphasizing the legal aspect of God's decision. This reflects the covenant relationship where blessings and curses were outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. God's judgments are consistent with His character as just and righteous, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>for all their wickedness</b><br>"Wickedness" here refers to the moral and spiritual corruption of the people. This includes idolatry, social injustice, and breaking the covenant with God. The term encompasses a broad range of sins, highlighting the comprehensive nature of their rebellion. The prophets frequently called out such wickedness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-2.htm">Ezekiel 16:2</a>, where similar language is used to describe Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>because they have forsaken Me</b><br>Forsaking God is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, symbolizing a breach of the covenant. This phrase underscores the relational aspect of Israel's sin, as they abandoned their unique relationship with Yahweh. The historical context includes alliances with foreign nations and adopting their gods, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-8</a>. This forsaking is not just a passive act but an active turning away from God.<p><b>and they have burned incense to other gods</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern worship, symbolizing prayer and devotion. The act of burning incense to other gods indicates idolatry, a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Archaeological findings, such as altars and incense burners, provide evidence of such practices in ancient Israel. This idolatry is condemned throughout the prophets, as in <a href="/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a> and <a href="/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>.<p><b>and worshiped the works of their own hands</b><br>This phrase highlights the futility and absurdity of idolatry, as people worship what they themselves have created. It reflects the cultural context where handcrafted idols were common, yet it also points to a deeper spiritual blindness. The prophets often mocked this practice, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the folly of idol-making is vividly described. This idolatry contrasts with the worship of the living God, who is the Creator, not a creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The verse affirms God&#8217;s holy jealousy and warns that covenant unfaithfulness invites real, righteous judgment, calling every reader to reject idols and cling solely to the living LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">I will utter my judgments against them.</span>--Here, again, we get a literal correspondence in the words of <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm" title="But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 39:5</a>, "he gave [or uttered] judgment upon him," of Nebuchadnezzar's sentence on Zedekiah.

The sins were of long standing, but the words point specially to the proportions they had assumed in the reign of Manasseh (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/33-1.htm" title="Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:">2Chronicles 33:1-7</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will utter my judgments</span>; or, I <span class="accented">will hold a court of justice upon them</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will speak judgments with them</span>. The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness</span>, etc. Their "wickedness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to "other gods," and bowing down to their images. "Burned incense" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only "to make a sweet odor," whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also <a href="/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where the word usually rendered "incense" seems rather to mean "a sweet smoke"). The prophet says, "of other gods" (not "of false gods"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see <a href="/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>) in Jeremiah.
