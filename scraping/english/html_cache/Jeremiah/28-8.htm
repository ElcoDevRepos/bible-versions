The reference to "prophets of old" connects Jeremiah to a long tradition of prophets in Israel, such as Moses, Samuel, Elijah, and Isaiah. These prophets were often called to deliver messages of warning and judgment, emphasizing their role as God's messengers. This continuity underscores the legitimacy of Jeremiah's own prophetic ministry, as he stands in the line of those who faithfully conveyed God's word.<p><b>prophesied war, disaster, and plague</b><br>The mention of "war, disaster, and plague" reflects the common themes of judgment found in the messages of the prophets. These elements were often seen as consequences of the people's disobedience to God. War and disaster were frequently used by God as instruments of judgment against nations, including Israel and Judah, for their idolatry and injustice. Plagues, such as those seen in Egypt during the Exodus, were also a sign of divine intervention and judgment. This phrase highlights the seriousness of the prophetic message and the reality of divine retribution.<p><b>against many lands and great kingdoms</b><br>This phrase indicates the scope of the prophetic messages, which were not limited to Israel but extended to "many lands and great kingdoms." This reflects the universal sovereignty of God over all nations, a theme prevalent in the prophetic literature. Prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel delivered oracles against foreign nations, demonstrating that God's judgment was not confined to His chosen people but applied to all who acted wickedly. This also foreshadows the New Testament message of the gospel being for all nations, emphasizing God's concern for justice and righteousness on a global scale.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hananiah.htm">Hananiah</a></b><br>A false prophet who opposed Jeremiah, claiming that God would break the yoke of Babylon and restore the exiles within two years.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_prophets.htm">Ancient Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the prophets who came before Jeremiah, such as Isaiah, Amos, and Micah, who also delivered messages of judgment and warning.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing the threat of Babylonian conquest during Jeremiah's time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that was rising to power and would eventually conquer Judah, leading to the Babylonian exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_of_true_prophecy.htm">Discernment of True Prophecy</a></b><br>True prophecy often includes warnings of judgment and calls for repentance.
