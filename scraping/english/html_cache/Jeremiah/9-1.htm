In the context of ancient Israel, water is often a symbol of life and sustenance, but here it is used to convey the depth of Jeremiah's grief. The imagery of a spring suggests an unending source, indicating the prophet's desire to mourn without ceasing. This reflects the intense emotional burden Jeremiah carries as he witnesses the spiritual and moral decline of his people.<p><b>and my eyes a fountain of tears!</b><br>The metaphor of eyes as a fountain of tears emphasizes the overwhelming sorrow Jeremiah feels. In biblical literature, tears are often associated with lamentation and repentance. This imagery connects to other instances in scripture where tears are a response to sin and impending judgment, such as in <a href="/lamentations/1-16.htm">Lamentations 1:16</a>. The prophet's tears symbolize not only personal grief but also a call for the people to recognize their need for repentance.<p><b>I would weep day and night</b><br>The expression of weeping day and night signifies a continuous and profound mourning. In the cultural context of the time, mourning was a communal and often public expression, involving specific rituals and periods of lament. Jeremiah's commitment to weep without ceasing underscores the severity of the situation facing Judah. This relentless mourning can be seen as a prophetic act, highlighting the urgency of the people's need to return to God.<p><b>over the slain daughter of my people.</b><br>The term "daughter of my people" is a poetic expression referring to the nation of Judah. The use of "daughter" conveys a sense of endearment and familial connection, emphasizing Jeremiah's deep love and concern for his people. Historically, this phrase points to the impending destruction and exile that Judah would face at the hands of the Babylonians. The "slain" aspect foreshadows the physical and spiritual devastation that would result from their continued disobedience. This lamentation can be seen as a type of Christ, who also wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), showing compassion and sorrow for the people's rejection of God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing deep sorrow and lamentation over the spiritual and physical state of his people, Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter_of_my_people.htm">The Daughter of My People</a></b><br>A poetic reference to the people of Israel, often used to express a close, familial relationship and deep affection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slain.htm">The Slain</a></b><br>Refers to those who have suffered or will suffer due to the impending judgment and destruction because of the nation's sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which is facing judgment due to its persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The event of divine retribution that Jeremiah foresees as a consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_a_prophet.htm">The Heart of a Prophet</a></b><br>Jeremiah's lamentation reveals the heart of a true prophet who deeply cares for his people and grieves over their sin and its consequences.

The form of a question was, in Hebrew idiom as in Latin, the natural utterance of desire. In the Hebrew text this verse comes as the last in Jeremiah 8. It is, of course, very closely connected with what precedes; but, on the other hand, it is even more closely connected with what follows. Strictly speaking, there ought to be no break at all, and the discourse should flow on continuously.<p><span class= "bld">A fountain.</span>--Here, as in <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-13.htm" title="O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, and elsewhere, the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">makor </span>is a tank or <span class= "ital">reservoir </span>rather than a spring.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The Hebrew more correctly attaches this verse to <a href="/jeremiah/8.htm">Jeremiah 8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Oh that my head were waters</span>, etc.!
