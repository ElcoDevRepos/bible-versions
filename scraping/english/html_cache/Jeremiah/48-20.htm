The shame and shattering of Moab refer to its defeat and humiliation, a common theme in prophetic literature where nations opposing God's people face judgment. Historically, Moab was a powerful kingdom east of the Dead Sea, known for its pride and idolatry. This prophecy aligns with earlier warnings in <a href="/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15-16</a> and <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2:1-3</a>, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all nations. The shattering signifies a complete and devastating defeat, reflecting the consequences of Moab's arrogance and sin.<p><b>Wail and cry out!</b><br>The call to wail and cry out is a typical prophetic expression urging lamentation over impending doom. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, public mourning involved loud cries and wailing, often accompanied by tearing clothes and wearing sackcloth. This phrase underscores the severity of Moab's destruction and the deep sorrow it would cause. It serves as a warning to other nations about the seriousness of divine judgment and the need for repentance.<p><b>Declare by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.</b><br>The Arnon River served as a significant geographical boundary between Moab and the Amorites, later becoming part of Israel's territory. Declaring Moab's destruction by the Arnon highlights the totality of the judgment, reaching even the borders of the land. This proclamation serves as a public announcement of Moab's downfall, ensuring that the news spreads throughout the region. The destruction of Moab fulfills earlier prophecies and serves as a testament to God's faithfulness in executing justice. The imagery of destruction also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and restoration themes found in the New Testament, pointing to the need for salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Shame in Scripture often follows idolatry and arrogance (<a href="/jeremiah/48-13.htm">Jeremiah 48:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>). Here, the Lord strips away every false security: their fertile plateau, their strategic cities, even their celebrated god Chemosh (<a href="/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>). Like Babylon would be disgraced later (<a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>), Moab&#8217;s reputation collapses.<p>&#8226; The verse signals that earthly honor cannot shield a people who oppose God (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This shame is not merely emotional; it is evidence that God&#8217;s verdict has already been pronounced (<a href="/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for it has been shattered</b><p>&#8220;Shattered&#8221; pictures total collapse, not a temporary setback. The word echoes earlier warnings: &#8220;Moab will be destroyed as a nation&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/48-42.htm">Jeremiah 48:42</a>). Joist by joist, God dismantles what pride built. Isaiah uses a similar image for idol wreckage&#8212;&#8220;Babylon has fallen, has been shattered!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a>). The fracture is so complete that only fragments remain, fulfilling <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> where Balaam foresaw a scepter from Israel crushing Moab.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgments are decisive; partial obedience or half-hearted repentance cannot halt them (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Brokenness is a divine tool to expose sin and invite humility (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wail and cry out!</b><p>The prophet calls survivors to grief, not resistance. Their mourning parallels Zion&#8217;s own lament in <a href="/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18&#8211;19</a>, underscoring that judgment is righteous yet sorrowful. <a href="/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16-17</a> depicts similar city-wide mourning when God passes through in judgment. <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a> pictures kings wailing over fallen Babylon; Moab&#8217;s wailing foreshadows that universal pattern&#8212;when idols fall, lament follows.<p>&#8226; Honest lament recognizes that sin&#8217;s wages are death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>) and seeks God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The command to wail shows that judgment is never casual to God; He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Declare by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed</b><p>The Arnon River marked Moab&#8217;s northern border (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>). News of ruin must ripple from the frontier inward; every village and fortress is on notice (<a href="/jeremiah/48-19.htm">Jeremiah 48:19</a>). This public proclamation mirrors Joshua&#8217;s trumpeted victories in Canaan (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>) and anticipates the global heralding of God&#8217;s final judgments (<a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment is never concealed; God confronts sin in the open (<a href="/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Geographical detail&#8212;naming the Arnon&#8212;anchors prophecy in history, proving God&#8217;s word is not abstract but intersects real places and peoples (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/48-20.htm">Jeremiah 48:20</a> compresses Moab&#8217;s entire fate into one verse: humiliation, destruction, lament, and public announcement. The passage asserts that God&#8217;s justice is certain, comprehensive, and evident to all. Pride invites shame; rebellion invites shattering. Yet even in the call to wail lies an invitation&#8212;recognize sin, turn, and find refuge in the Lord who judges righteously and saves lavishly (<a href="/psalms/34-22.htm">Psalm 34:22</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Tell ye it in Arnon.</span>--The name, which means a rushing stream, belonged to the chief river of Moab, now the <span class= "ital">Mugab, </span>which rises in the Arabian mountains and flows into the Dead Sea.
