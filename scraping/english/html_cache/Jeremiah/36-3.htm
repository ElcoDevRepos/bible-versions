The historical context is the reign of King Jehoiakim, a time of political instability and spiritual decline in Judah. The calamity refers to the impending Babylonian invasion and exile, a consequence of the nation's persistent idolatry and disobedience. This echoes the covenantal warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's faithfulness. The use of "perhaps" indicates God's hope for repentance, aligning with His character as described in <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, where He takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked but desires that they turn from their ways.<p><b>each of them will turn from his wicked way</b><br>This phrase emphasizes individual responsibility in repentance. The call to turn from wickedness is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, highlighting the personal nature of sin and the need for personal repentance. The Hebrew concept of "turning" (shuv) is central to the idea of repentance, involving a complete change of direction and a return to God. This is consistent with the message of the prophets, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>, which calls for the wicked to forsake their ways and return to the Lord. The individual focus here underscores that while the message is to the nation, each person must respond personally.<p><b>Then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reveals God's readiness to forgive, contingent upon genuine repentance. Forgiveness is a key aspect of God's covenant relationship with His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises healing and forgiveness if His people humble themselves and pray. The terms "iniquity" and "sin" encompass both the moral and legal aspects of wrongdoing, indicating a comprehensive forgiveness. This promise of forgiveness foreshadows the New Covenant, where ultimate forgiveness is realized through Jesus Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> and fulfilled in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/8-12.htm">Hebrews 8:12</a>). The assurance of forgiveness upon repentance highlights God's mercy and grace, central themes throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing imminent disaster due to its persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe, who wrote down the words of the prophecy as dictated by Jeremiah and read them to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his resistance to Jeremiah's prophecies and his eventual destruction of the scroll containing God's words.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>A physical representation of God's word, written by Baruch, intended to be read to the people of Judah as a warning and a call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>God's word is intended to convict and lead to repentance.
