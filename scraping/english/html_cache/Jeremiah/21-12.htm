This phrase underscores the covenantal relationship between God and the Davidic dynasty, highlighting their duty to uphold justice and righteousness. The invocation of the LORD's authority indicates the seriousness of the message, as it comes directly from God, who is the ultimate judge and ruler.<p><b>Administer justice every morning:</b><br>The call to "administer justice every morning" suggests a daily commitment to righteousness and fairness. In ancient Israel, the morning was a time for legal proceedings and judgments, reflecting the need for consistent and timely justice. This command aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice as a central aspect of God's character and His expectations for His people (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>And rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor:</b><br>This phrase highlights the social responsibility of leaders to protect the vulnerable and oppressed. The emphasis on rescuing victims of robbery points to a society plagued by injustice and exploitation. It echoes the biblical mandate to care for the marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a> and <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>, where God's people are called to defend the rights of the poor and needy.<p><b>Or My wrath will go forth like fire and burn with no one to extinguish it:</b><br>The imagery of God's wrath as an unquenchable fire serves as a powerful warning of impending judgment. Fire is often used in the Bible to symbolize God's purifying and destructive power (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). This phrase underscores the seriousness of failing to uphold justice, as divine retribution is inevitable and unstoppable without repentance and reform.<p><b>Because of their evil deeds:</b><br>The "evil deeds" refer to the systemic injustice and moral corruption prevalent in the society of Judah. This phrase connects the people's actions with the consequences they face, emphasizing the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). It serves as a reminder that God's judgment is a response to human sinfulness, calling for repentance and a return to His ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>Refers to the royal lineage of King David, representing the leadership and governance of Judah.

To rise at dawn of day, to sit in the gate and listen to the complaints of those who had been wronged, was the surest way to gain the affection of his people. It was David's neglect of this that gave an opening for the rebellion of Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm" title="And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2Samuel 15:2</a>). Solomon's early fame for wisdom rested on his discharge of this duty (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm" title="And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.">1Kings 3:28</a>). If the king remained slothfully in his palace in those golden hours of morning, the noon-tide heat made it impossible for him to retrieve the lost opportunity. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm" title="And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.">2Samuel 4:5</a>.)
