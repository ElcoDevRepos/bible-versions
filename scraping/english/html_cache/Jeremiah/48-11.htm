This ease is indicative of a lack of significant upheaval or conquest, allowing Moab to develop a complacent and self-satisfied culture. The phrase suggests a long-standing comfort that has led to spiritual and moral stagnation. In biblical history, Moab often had a contentious relationship with Israel, yet they were not frequently subjected to the same level of divine judgment or exile as Israel and Judah.<p><b>settled like wine on its dregs</b><br>This metaphor describes Moab's complacency and stagnation. In winemaking, wine left on its dregs becomes thick and undrinkable, symbolizing how Moab has become stagnant and resistant to change. The imagery suggests a lack of refinement or purification, as the dregs represent impurities. This can be seen as a spiritual metaphor for a nation that has not been tested or refined by trials.<p><b>he has not been poured from vessel to vessel</b><br>The process of pouring wine from one vessel to another was used to refine and purify it, removing the dregs. Moab's lack of this process symbolizes a lack of divine intervention or judgment that would lead to growth or purification. This can be contrasted with Israel's history, where God frequently used trials and exile to refine His people. The absence of such experiences in Moab's history has left them unchanged and unrefined.<p><b>or gone into exile</b><br>Exile is a significant theme in the Bible, often used as a tool for divine judgment and purification. Israel and Judah experienced exile as a consequence of their disobedience, leading to repentance and eventual restoration. Moab's lack of exile indicates a nation that has not faced the same level of divine discipline, resulting in spiritual stagnation. This absence of exile underscores Moab's unchallenged and unchanged state.<p><b>So his flavor has remained the same, and his aroma is unchanged</b><br>The unchanged flavor and aroma of Moab symbolize a nation that has not experienced transformation or renewal. In biblical terms, this can be seen as a failure to grow spiritually or morally. The imagery of flavor and aroma can also be connected to the idea of a pleasing sacrifice to God, suggesting that Moab's unchanged state is not pleasing to Him. This lack of change contrasts with the transformative work God seeks to do in His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which calls for renewal and transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a> we have the hope of the prophet that the discipline will do its work. The "vessels" and "bottles" of <a href="/jeremiah/48-12.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will send to him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.">Jeremiah 48:12</a> are, of course, the cities and villages of Moab. (Comp. the imagery of <a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moab hath been at ease from his youth</span>. The "youth" of Moab dates from its subjugation of the aboriginal Emim (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>)' Since that event, though often at war, sometimes tributary and sometimes expelled from a part of the territory claimed by them (see the inscription on the Moabite Stone), yet they had never been disturbed in their ancestral homes to the south of the river Amen. <span class="cmt_word">He hath settled on his less.</span> It was the custom to leave wine for a time on its lees or sediment, in order to heighten its strength and flavour (comp. <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Emptied from vessel to vessel.</span> Thevenot, an old traveller in Persia, remarks of the Shiraz wine that, after it is separated from the lees, it is apt to grow sour. "The wine is put into large earthen jars, each holding from ten or twelve to fourteen <span class="accented">carabas</span>; but when a jar has been opened, it must be emptied as soon as possible, and the wine put into bottles or <span class="accented">carabas</span>, otherwise it spoils and becomes sour" ('Voyages,' 2:245, quoted by Lowth on <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). In the application of the figure, the "taste" of Moab means obviously the national character. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has been at ease</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;a&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;nan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7599.htm">Strong's 7599: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be at ease or at peace, rest securely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from youth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;&#183;r&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
