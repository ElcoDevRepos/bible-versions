The Chaldeans, synonymous with the Babylonians, were a dominant force in the ancient Near East. Historically, Zedekiah's reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule, which led to the siege of Jerusalem. This prophecy underscores the futility of Zedekiah's attempts to resist God's judgment through the Babylonians, as previously warned by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>).<p><b>but he will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon</b><br>This part of the prophecy was fulfilled when Zedekiah was captured after attempting to flee Jerusalem during its fall in 586 BC. The "king of Babylon" refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, who was God's instrument of judgment against Judah. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking the end of the Davidic reign in Jerusalem until the coming of Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-7</a>).<p><b>and will speak with him face to face</b><br>The phrase "face to face" indicates a direct and personal encounter between Zedekiah and Nebuchadnezzar. This meeting symbolizes the confrontation between human defiance and divine sovereignty. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such encounters often signified judgment and the transfer of power. This moment fulfilled Jeremiah's prophecy and demonstrated the certainty of God's word (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>).<p><b>and see him eye to eye</b><br>"Eye to eye" emphasizes the personal nature of Zedekiah's judgment. It signifies the undeniable reality of God's prophetic word coming to pass. This encounter would have been a moment of realization for Zedekiah, as he faced the consequences of his rebellion against God. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the personal accountability each individual has before God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.
