This phrase highlights Israel's lack of awareness or concern for her unfaithfulness to God. The indifference suggests a hardened heart, a condition often warned against in Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>). This spiritual blindness is akin to the condition of the Laodicean church in <a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-17</a>, which was unaware of its own spiritual poverty.<p><b>Israel had defiled the land</b><br>The defilement of the land refers to the spiritual and moral corruption that resulted from Israel's idolatry. In the Old Testament, the land is often seen as a gift from God, a place of blessing contingent upon Israel's obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The defilement is not just a personal sin but has communal and environmental consequences, echoing the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and committed adultery with stones and trees</b><br>This phrase uses the metaphor of adultery to describe Israel's idolatry. Stones and trees refer to the materials used to create idols and the locations of pagan worship, such as the high places and sacred groves. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a>, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital unfaithfulness. The use of natural elements in idol worship reflects the Canaanite religious practices that Israel adopted, contrary to God's commands in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>. This idolatry is a direct violation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, symbolizing a breach of trust and loyalty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and spiritual adultery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to Judah and Israel, warning them of their unfaithfulness and calling them to repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/adultery_with_stones_and_trees.htm">Adultery with Stones and Trees</a></b><br>A metaphor for idolatry, where Israel worshipped idols made of stone and wood, turning away from the true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which was defiled by Israel's idolatrous practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who desires faithfulness from His people and calls them back to Himself.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_idolatry.htm">The Seriousness of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our hearts.

Much like the church at Laodicea, who was &#8220;neither cold nor hot&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-15.htm">Revelation 3:15-16</a>), Israel drifted into a lukewarm complacency.<p>&#8226; Indifference is deadly because it silences conviction. When conscience no longer stings, repentance feels unnecessary.<p>&#8226; This attitude contrasts sharply with King David&#8217;s brokenness over sin in <a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>&#8212;showing that awareness of sin and godly sorrow remain essential for restoration (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel had defiled the land</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Israel defiled the land&#8230;.&#8221; Sin is never a purely private act; it ripples outward, even into the very ground God had gifted.

Apostasy was treated once more as if it had been a light thing (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31</a>). The word is, however, very variously interpreted, and the meaning of "voice," or "cry," in the sense in which the "cry" of Sodom and Gomorrah was great (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm" title="And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;">Genesis 18:20</a>), seems more satisfactory. On "stones" and "stocks," see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/2-27.htm" title="Saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.">Jeremiah 2:27</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Through the lightness of her whoredom</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. through the slight importance which she attached to her whoredom. So apparently the ancient versions. The only sense, however, which the word <span class="accented">kol</span> ever has in Hebrew is not "lightness," but "sound," "voice," and perhaps "rumor" (<a href="/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>). Hence it is more strictly accurate to render "through the cry." etc. (comp. <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13</a>), or "through the fame," etc. (as Authorized Version, margin). But neither of these seems quite suitable to the context, and if, as King James's translators seem to have felt it necessary to do, we desert the faithful translation, and enter on the path of conjecture, why not emend <span class="accented">kol</span> into <span class="accented">klon</span> (there is no <span class="accented">vav</span>, and such fragments of true readings are not altogether uncommon in the Hebrew text), which at once yields a good meaning - "through the disgrace of her whoredom ?"
