The exiles were primarily from Judah, taken during the Babylonian captivity, which began in 597 BC. This message underscores the importance of divine communication and guidance during times of distress and displacement. The exiles were in a foreign land, away from the temple and their traditional worship practices, making prophetic messages crucial for maintaining their faith and identity.<p><b>what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite.</b><br>Shemaiah is identified as a Nehelamite, which may refer to his place of origin or a family designation. The LORD's message concerning him highlights the issue of false prophecy, a recurring problem in Israel's history. False prophets often arose during times of crisis, offering messages that contradicted God's true prophets. This situation is reminiscent of other false prophets in the Old Testament, such as those confronted by Elijah and Jeremiah himself.<p><b>Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you&#8212;though I did not send him&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unauthorized nature of Shemaiah's prophecy. In the biblical context, a true prophet is one who is sent by God, as seen in the calling of prophets like Moses (Exodus 3) and Isaiah (Isaiah 6). The distinction between true and false prophets is critical, as false prophets can lead people away from God's will. This is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where criteria for discerning true prophecy are given.<p><b>and has made you trust in a lie,</b><br>The consequence of Shemaiah's false prophecy is that it led the exiles to trust in a lie. This reflects the danger of false teachings, which can lead believers away from the truth of God's word. Trusting in a lie can have severe spiritual consequences, as seen in the fall of Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where believing the serpent's lie led to sin entering the world. This phrase serves as a warning to discern truth from falsehood, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament (e.g., 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shemaiah_the_nehelamite.htm">Shemaiah the Nehelamite</a></b><br>A false prophet who misled the exiles in Babylon by claiming to speak for God without being sent by Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exiles.htm">The Exiles</a></b><br>The people of Judah who were taken captive to Babylon, living in a foreign land and longing for God's deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place of exile for the people of Judah, representing both a physical and spiritual place of testing and refinement.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and truth through His true prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and test all teachings against the Word of God to avoid being led astray by false prophets.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_lies.htm">The Danger of Lies</a></b><br>Trusting in lies can lead to spiritual destruction.
