An eagle will soar and swoop down</b><br>This imagery of an eagle is often used in the Bible to symbolize swiftness and strength, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>. The eagle represents a powerful force, often associated with divine judgment or a conquering nation. In the context of Jeremiah, it signifies the impending judgment on Edom, a nation historically antagonistic to Israel. The eagle's ability to soar and swoop down swiftly suggests an unavoidable and decisive attack.<p><b>spreading its wings over Bozrah</b><br>Bozrah was a major city in Edom, located in present-day Jordan. It was a fortified city, known for its strategic importance and wealth. The spreading of wings over Bozrah indicates a complete and encompassing judgment, leaving no part of the city untouched. This imagery can be connected to the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, as seen in other prophetic books like <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> and <a href="/amos/1-12.htm">Amos 1:12</a>, where Bozrah is also mentioned in the context of divine retribution.<p><b>In that day the hearts of Edom&#8217;s mighty men</b><br>The phrase "in that day" is often used in prophetic literature to denote a specific time of divine intervention or judgment. The "mighty men" of Edom refers to its warriors and leaders, known for their strength and valor. Historically, Edom was a nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, and had a long-standing enmity with Israel. The mention of their hearts highlights the internal impact of fear and despair that will accompany the external devastation.<p><b>will be like the heart of a woman in labor</b><br>This simile emphasizes intense fear and helplessness. In ancient times, childbirth was a perilous event, often associated with great pain and vulnerability. By comparing Edom's warriors to a woman in labor, the text underscores the complete reversal of their expected courage and strength. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>, to depict overwhelming fear and distress during times of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eagle.htm">Eagle</a></b><br>Symbolic of swiftness and power, often used in the Bible to represent God's judgment or a powerful nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bozrah.htm">Bozrah</a></b><br>A city in Edom, representing the Edomite nation, known for its fortifications and strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, often in conflict with Israel, representing pride and opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men_of_edom.htm">Mighty Men of Edom</a></b><br>The warriors or leaders of Edom, known for their strength and valor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman_in_labor.htm">Woman in Labor</a></b><br>A metaphor for fear and helplessness, illustrating the sudden and overwhelming nature of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_swiftness_of_god's_judgment.htm">The Swiftness of God's Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment can come swiftly and unexpectedly, like an eagle swooping down.
