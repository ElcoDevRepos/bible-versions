Historically, Jerusalem was a significant city due to its religious, political, and economic importance. The prophecy suggests a time when its downfall will be so severe that it will draw international attention. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using Israel as a witness to the nations, whether through blessing or judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>).<p><b>and ask one another,</b><br>The act of asking implies a sense of astonishment and curiosity. This reflects the cultural practice of seeking understanding through dialogue, a common method in ancient Near Eastern societies. The communal nature of the inquiry suggests that the destruction of Jerusalem will be so unexpected that it will prompt widespread discussion among the nations.<p><b>&#8216;Why has the LORD done such a thing</b><br>This question acknowledges the sovereignty of the LORD (Yahweh) over the events that befall Jerusalem. It implies that the nations recognize the hand of God in the city's fate, which aligns with the biblical theme that God is actively involved in the affairs of nations (<a href="/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a>). The use of "LORD" emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the seriousness of their disobedience.<p><b>to this great city?&#8217;</b><br>Jerusalem is referred to as a "great city," underscoring its importance and the magnitude of its fall. This term reflects its status as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple, which was considered the dwelling place of God on earth. The destruction of such a significant city would serve as a powerful testament to the consequences of breaking covenant with God. This phrase also foreshadows the lamentations and reflections found in the Book of Lamentations, where the fall of Jerusalem is mourned and examined.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
