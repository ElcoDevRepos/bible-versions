Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites, associated with war and destruction. The shame mentioned here refers to the realization of the futility of trusting in a false god. This reflects a common biblical theme where nations or individuals who rely on idols or false gods ultimately face disappointment and disgrace. The shame of Moab is prophetic, indicating a future judgment where their reliance on Chemosh will be proven worthless.<p><b>just as the house of Israel was ashamed</b><br>The house of Israel refers to the northern kingdom, which fell into idolatry after the division of the united monarchy. Their shame came from the realization that their idols could not save them from the consequences of their actions, particularly during the Assyrian conquest. This comparison highlights the parallel between Moab's future disgrace and Israel's past experiences, emphasizing the universal truth that reliance on anything other than the true God leads to downfall.<p><b>when they trusted in Bethel</b><br>Bethel was a significant religious site in the northern kingdom of Israel, where Jeroboam I set up one of the golden calves to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem to worship. This act of idolatry led to spiritual corruption and eventual judgment. The reference to Bethel underscores the theme of misplaced trust and the inevitable shame that follows.
