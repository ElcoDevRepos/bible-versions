In the context of Jeremiah, "her" refers to Jerusalem, which is under threat of invasion. The imagery of shepherds suggests organized leadership and the inevitability of the coming judgment. Historically, this reflects the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, where the city was surrounded by enemy forces. The shepherds symbolize the leaders of these invading nations, and their flocks represent the soldiers. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic warnings in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>, where foreign nations are summoned as instruments of divine judgment.<p><b>they will pitch their tents all around her,</b><br>The act of pitching tents signifies a prolonged siege, indicating that the invaders are preparing for an extended campaign against Jerusalem. This was a common military tactic in ancient warfare, where armies would encamp around a city to cut off supplies and weaken the inhabitants. The encirclement of Jerusalem is a fulfillment of the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who repeatedly called the people to repentance to avoid such calamities. The encampment also symbolizes the totality of the threat, as the city is surrounded on all sides, leaving no escape. This is reminiscent of the siege described in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-2</a>, where the Babylonians besieged Jerusalem during the reign of Zedekiah.<p><b>each tending his own portion:</b><br>This phrase suggests that the invading forces are organized and methodical, with each group responsible for a specific section of the siege. It reflects the division of labor and the strategic planning involved in military operations. The phrase can also imply the thoroughness of the judgment against Jerusalem, as every part of the city is targeted. In a broader theological sense, it underscores the idea that God's judgment is comprehensive and precise, leaving no part of the city untouched. This meticulous division of the siege parallels the detailed prophecies found in books like Ezekiel, where the consequences of disobedience are laid out with precision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>In this context, the shepherds symbolize leaders or rulers who are coming against Jerusalem.

Tents popping up everywhere spell relentless pressure&#8212;no escape routes, no supply lines, no relief.<p>&#8226; The circle of tents is the opposite of <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, where &#8220;the angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him.&#8221; Jerusalem&#8217;s rebellion has traded divine protection for enemy encirclement (<a href="/jeremiah/4-17.htm">Jeremiah 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The image also evokes <a href="/numbers/31-10.htm">Numbers 31:10</a>, where Israel&#8217;s armies camp around Midian before judgment.
