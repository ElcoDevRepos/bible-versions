In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/28.htm">Jeremiah 28</a>, Hananiah opposes Jeremiah's message from God, which warned of the Babylonian captivity. Hananiah's role highlights the presence of false prophets in Israel, a recurring issue throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>). His actions serve as a warning against those who claim to speak for God without His authority.<p><b>took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet</b><br>The yoke symbolizes submission and servitude, which Jeremiah had been wearing as a prophetic sign of the coming Babylonian domination (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>). By removing the yoke, Hananiah attempts to symbolize the breaking of Babylon's power, contradicting God's message through Jeremiah. This act of removing the yoke is significant as it represents a direct challenge to God's prophetic word, illustrating the tension between true and false prophecy.<p><b>and broke it</b><br>Breaking the yoke is a dramatic gesture meant to convey liberation and freedom, aligning with Hananiah's false prophecy that the Babylonian captivity would end within two years (<a href="/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2-3</a>). However, this act of breaking the yoke is ultimately futile and misleading, as God's true message through Jeremiah was that the captivity would last seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). This event underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the futility of opposing God's plans. It also foreshadows the ultimate breaking of spiritual bondage through Jesus Christ, who offers true liberation from sin (<a href="/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

Here it pictures Babylon&#8217;s unavoidable lordship.<p>- Hananiah&#8217;s grasping of the yoke is an aggressive attempt to rewrite God&#8217;s message&#8212;much like King Jehoiakim cutting and burning Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet</b><p>- The removal targets God&#8217;s messenger, not merely a prop.

Hananiah, a self-styled prophet, seizes Jeremiah&#8217;s wooden yoke&#8212;God&#8217;s visual sermon of forthcoming Babylonian rule&#8212;rips it away, and smashes it to proclaim an easy deliverance. The gesture looks bold but is empty, for God soon replaces wood with iron and ends Hananiah&#8217;s life, confirming Jeremiah&#8217;s message. The verse warns believers to test every voice by Scripture, to expect opposition when we stand with God&#8217;s word, and to rest in the certainty that His purposes cannot be broken, no matter who tries to snap the yoke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10, 11) <span class= "bld">Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke . . .</span>--We are reminded of the conduct of Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, in <a href="/1_kings/22-24.htm" title="But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak to you?">1Kings 22:24</a>. Personal violence, as has been the case in some Christian controversies, takes the place of further debate. The hateful symbols of servitude should not be allowed to outrage the feelings of the people any longer. His success in breaking that was to be the pledge of the destruction of the power which it represented. Jeremiah, it will be noted, does not resist or retaliate, but commits himself to Him that judgeth righteously.
