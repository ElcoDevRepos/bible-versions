It suggests a realization of impending danger and the need for immediate action. In the context of Jeremiah, the people of Judah are facing the threat of Babylonian invasion. This rhetorical question indicates a moment of self-awareness and acknowledgment of their dire situation.<p><b>Gather together,</b><br>The call to gather together implies a communal response to the crisis. In ancient Israel, communal actions were often necessary for survival, especially in times of war or disaster. This reflects the cultural importance of community and collective action in the face of external threats.<p><b>let us flee to the fortified cities</b><br>Fortified cities were places of refuge during times of military threat. Historically, cities like Jerusalem had strong walls and defenses. This phrase indicates a strategy to seek protection in places that were considered secure. It also highlights the lack of faith in divine protection, as the people rely on human fortifications instead.<p><b>and perish there,</b><br>The expectation of perishing even in fortified cities underscores the hopelessness of the situation. It suggests that the people recognize the futility of their efforts to escape divine judgment. This reflects the prophetic theme of inevitable judgment due to persistent sin.<p><b>for the LORD our God has doomed us.</b><br>This acknowledges the divine origin of their predicament. The use of "the LORD our God" indicates a recognition of their covenant relationship with God, which they have violated. The concept of being doomed by God is consistent with the prophetic warnings throughout Jeremiah, where divine judgment is portrayed as a consequence of covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>He has given us poisoned water to drink,</b><br>Poisoned water symbolizes the bitterness and severity of God's judgment. In the ancient Near East, water was a vital resource, and its contamination would be a severe punishment. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where water is used as a metaphor for judgment, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23-25</a> and <a href="/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10-11</a>.<p><b>because we have sinned against the LORD.</b><br>This phrase identifies the root cause of their suffering: sin against God. It reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to judgment. The acknowledgment of sin is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing the need for repentance and the consequences of disobedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment due to their persistent sin and rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing God's judgment for its idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_cities.htm">Fortified Cities</a></b><br>Places of refuge that people sought for protection against invading armies, symbolizing a false sense of security in human defenses rather than in God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, executing judgment on His people for their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/poisoned_water.htm">Poisoned Water</a></b><br>A metaphor for the consequences of sin and the judgment that God was bringing upon His people, reflecting the bitterness and suffering due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to judgment and suffering.

Their inaction reveals spiritual numbness rather than ignorance. Earlier warnings&#8212;<a href="/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3-4</a>; 6:16-17; 7:23&#8212;called for repentance, but the nation preferred complacency. <a href="/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9-11</a> shows that sitting still in the face of danger brings ruin; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> urges doing, not merely hearing. The verse exposes a heart problem: knowing truth without acting on it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gather together</b><p>A sudden rush replaces apathy. Community response is appropriate (<a href="/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; 2:15-17), but here it flows from panic, not faith. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a> points to gathering for encouragement toward obedience; Judah gathers to scheme self-preservation. The contrast reminds believers that unity is powerful only when anchored in trustful obedience to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there</b><p>Running to walled towns&#8212;perhaps Lachish, Azekah, or even Jerusalem&#8212;seems logical (<a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5-6</a>). Yet they concede they will &#8220;perish there.&#8221; Walls cannot shield from divine judgment (<a href="/amos/9-1.htm">Amos 9:1-4</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>). Trusting human defenses over covenant faithfulness exposes misplaced hope. In <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a> Jesus weeps over a similarly self-reliant Jerusalem doomed by unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the LORD our God has doomed us</b><p>The people finally admit the true source of their crisis: God Himself opposes them (<a href="/jeremiah/7-20.htm">Jeremiah 7:20</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1-5</a>). <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> promised blessings for obedience and curses for rebellion; the covenant terms stand unchanged. <a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a> soberly states, &#8220;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&#8221; Recognition of divine judgment is the first step toward genuine repentance (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has given us poisoned water to drink</b><p>&#8220;Poisoned water&#8221; (literally &#8220;water of gall&#8221;) symbolizes bitterness and unavoidable suffering (<a href="/jeremiah/9-15.htm">Jeremiah 9:15</a>; 23:15). <a href="/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32-33</a> links gall with covenant unfaithfulness. <a href="/revelation/8-11.htm">Revelation 8:11</a> later pictures a star named Wormwood turning waters bitter, echoing Jeremiah&#8217;s imagery. The point is clear: what God once provided as life-giving refreshment (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>) becomes bitter when people reject Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because we have sinned against the LORD</b><p>The cause is confessed, though without evidence of contrition. Sin against the LORD&#8212;idolatry, social injustice, empty ritual&#8212;brings certain consequences (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>). <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> affirms that &#8220;the wages of sin is death,&#8221; while <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a> offers the remedy: confession and forgiveness through God&#8217;s faithful justice. The verse drives home personal responsibility; blame lies nowhere else.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Jeremiah 8:14</a> paints a tragic spiral: spiritual apathy, frantic self-reliance, recognition of divine wrath, and bitter consequences, all rooted in unrepentant sin.

In <a href="/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> (and so <a href="/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>) it is clearly used for "venom" in general; and yet in Ver. 32 of the same chapter it obviously means a plant. Another general application of the term seems to have been to bitterness in general, the ideas of bitterness and poisonousness being taken as interchangeable. The Authorized Version may therefore stand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are we</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;na&#7717;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_587.htm">Strong's 587: </a> </span><span class="str2">We</span><br /><br /><span class="word">just sitting here?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Gather together,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1464;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;s&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let us flee</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1489;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
