In the historical context, Israel was surrounded by nations with idolatrous customs, which often tempted them away from their covenant with God. The term "worthless" underscores the emptiness and ineffectiveness of these practices, as they cannot provide salvation or true guidance. This echoes the broader biblical theme found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where idols are described as powerless and deceptive.<p><b>they cut down a tree from the forest;</b><br>This imagery refers to the process of creating idols, which often began with selecting a tree. The act of cutting down a tree signifies the human effort involved in idol-making, contrasting with the divine creation of the world. This practice was common among ancient Near Eastern cultures, where wood was a primary material for crafting idols. The reference to the forest emphasizes the natural origin of these idols, highlighting their inability to transcend their earthly materials.<p><b>it is shaped with a chisel by the hands of a craftsman.</b><br>The craftsmanship involved in idol-making is depicted here, pointing to the skill and artistry required to fashion these objects of worship. This phrase underscores the irony that these idols, despite being crafted with human hands, are revered as gods. The use of a chisel indicates the transformation of raw material into a finished product, yet it remains a man-made object. This critique of idolatry is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which mock the lifelessness and impotence of idols. The emphasis on human involvement in creating idols serves as a reminder of their inherent limitations and the superiority of the Creator God, who is not made by human hands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and the call to repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Refers to the pagan nations surrounding Israel, whose customs and practices were often contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_craftsman.htm">The Craftsman</a></b><br>Represents those who create idols, shaping wood into objects of worship, highlighting the futility of idol-making.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_forest.htm">The Forest</a></b><br>Symbolizes the natural world, from which materials are taken to create idols, emphasizing the contrast between God's creation and man-made idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The central event or practice being critiqued, where people worship objects made by human hands instead of the living God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are man-made and powerless, contrasting with the living God who is the Creator of all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_discernment.htm">Cultural Discernment</a></b><br>Believers are called to discern and reject cultural practices that lead away from true worship of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_unchanging_nature_of_god.htm">The Unchanging Nature of God</a></b><br>Unlike idols, God is unchanging and eternal, deserving of our worship and trust.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_true_worship.htm">The Call to True Worship</a></b><br>Worship should be directed to God alone, who is spirit and truth, rather than to objects or images.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_modern_idolatry.htm">Guarding Against Modern Idolatry</a></b><br>In today's context, idolatry can take many forms, such as materialism or the elevation of personal desires above God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_10_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 10:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_10_3_Avoid_pagan_customs.htm">How does Jeremiah 10:3 warn against adopting pagan customs in our lives today?

As in <a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3</a> and <a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>, He calls these customs &#8220;worthless,&#8221; meaning they offer no truth, no power, no salvation&#8212;only empty ritual.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a> echoes this verdict: idols are &#8220;the work of men&#8217;s hands&#8221; and those who trust in them &#8220;will be like them.&#8221; The living God exposes dead religion.<p>&#8226; By labeling the customs &#8220;worthless,&#8221; the Lord also reminds His people that following the crowd never justifies disobedience (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).

The grandeur and fulness of Isaiah's language, and the unlikeness of what we find here to Jeremiah's usual style, makes it more probable that he was the copyist, and so far adds to the argument for the authorship of the chapter ascribed to Isaiah. It is, however, possible, as some critics have thought, that these verses are an interpolation, and in that case they supply no evidence either way. The fact that they are found in the LXX. as well as in the Hebrew is, however, in favour of their genuineness. It may be noted that the substance of what follows has a parallel in the Epistle ascribed to Jeremiah in the apocryphal book of Baruch.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The customs of the people</span>.

It seems to be implied that the "customs" are of religious origin (setup. <a href="/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8</a>, where "the statutes of the heathen" are obviously the rites and customs of polytheism. <span class="cmt_word">For one cutteth a tree</span>, etc. This is intended to prove the foregoing statement of the "vanity," or groundlessness, of idolatry.
