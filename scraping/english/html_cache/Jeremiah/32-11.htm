This act is significant because it occurs during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, symbolizing hope and future restoration. The purchase is a prophetic act demonstrating faith in God's promise that the land will once again be inhabited and cultivated by the Israelites.<p><b>the sealed copy with its terms and conditions</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern legal practices, property transactions were documented in two copies: a sealed copy and an open copy. The sealed copy was the official, unalterable record, often stored in a safe place for future reference. This practice ensured the integrity and authenticity of the transaction. The terms and conditions would include details such as the price, boundaries, and any obligations of the buyer and seller, reflecting the meticulous nature of legal agreements in that era.<p><b>as well as the open copy</b><br>The open copy was accessible for public viewing, allowing others to verify the transaction. This transparency was crucial in maintaining trust and preventing disputes over property ownership. The existence of both copies highlights the importance of accountability and transparency in legal matters, principles that are echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in the laws given in Deuteronomy. This dual documentation can also be seen as a metaphor for God's promises, which are both sealed in His divine will and openly declared through His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

The more probable explanation, however, is that the unsealed document, which the witnesses did not subscribe or see, contained details which did not concern the witnesses, the price paid (though the mention of the witnesses before the weighing of the money militates against this view), the conditions of resumption by the vendor, possibly some reference to the period of seventy years, at the end of which, and not before, the heirs of Jeremiah might expect to enter on possession.<p><span class= "bld">According to the law and custom.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">to wit, the agreement and the conditions. </span>The whole transaction may be compared, as an example of ancient conveyancing, with the transfer of the field and cave of Machpelah in Genesis 23<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
