Egypt was often a place of refuge due to its distance and political independence from Judah. This reflects the historical context where Egypt was a significant power and a place of asylum, as seen when Jeroboam fled there from Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). Uriah's flight to Egypt underscores the peril prophets faced when delivering messages that opposed the king's desires.<p><b>and took him to King Jehoiakim</b><br>King Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, reigned during a turbulent period marked by political alliances and subjugation to foreign powers like Babylon. His reign is characterized by opposition to prophetic messages, as seen in his treatment of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>). The retrieval of Uriah from Egypt demonstrates Jehoiakim's determination to silence dissent and maintain control, reflecting the broader theme of resistance to God's word.<p><b>who had him put to the sword</b><br>The execution of Uriah by the sword signifies the severe consequences faced by those who opposed the king. This act of violence against a prophet highlights the rejection of God's message and the lengths to which Jehoiakim would go to suppress it. It parallels the New Testament accounts of the persecution of prophets and apostles, such as the beheading of John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/6-27.htm">Mark 6:27</a>).<p><b>and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people</b><br>The disposal of Uriah's body in a common grave signifies disgrace and dishonor, contrasting with the honorable burial typically afforded to prophets. This act reflects the cultural and religious significance of burial practices in ancient Israel, where proper burial was a sign of respect and dignity. It also foreshadows the treatment of Jesus Christ, who was crucified and buried in a borrowed tomb, highlighting the theme of suffering and rejection faced by God's messengers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_prophet.htm">Uriah the Prophet</a></b><br>A prophet who, like Jeremiah, prophesied against Jerusalem and Judah.

Egypt often looked like a safe haven to Judah&#8217;s leaders (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;3</a>), yet it could never shield anyone from God&#8217;s purposes. Elnathan and the escort that captured Uriah illustrate how human alliances can be turned against a believer when the ruling powers feel threatened. Just as Pharaoh Necho once pulled Jehoahaz out of Judah and carried him to Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>), so Jehoiakim drags God&#8217;s prophet back, proving that worldly refuge is unreliable compared with the Lord&#8217;s protection (<a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took him to King Jehoiakim</b><p>Standing before Jehoiakim meant standing before a man already notorious for slashing and burning Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22&#8211;24</a>) and for shedding &#8220;innocent blood&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-17.htm">Jeremiah 22:17</a>). Bringing Uriah directly to the king underscores:<p>&#8226; absolute control Jehoiakim believed he had over prophecy, people, and politics.<p>&#8226; the prophet&#8217;s total isolation&#8212;no priest, elder, or court official intervened as they later did for Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>).<p>This contrast highlights the sovereign timing of God: He sometimes preserves one servant while permitting another to seal the testimony with his life (<a href="/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had him put to the sword</b><p>The sword symbolizes swift, decisive rejection of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>). Jehoiakim&#8217;s execution order echoes Manasseh&#8217;s murder of innocent prophets (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>) and foreshadows the rejection Christ Himself would face (<a href="/matthew/21-35.htm">Matthew 21:35&#8211;39</a>). In silencing Uriah, the king sealed his own indictment, for God promised that &#8220;the sword&#8221; would later punish Jehoiakim&#8217;s house and the nation (<a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8&#8211;9</a>).

Ironically, Jehoiakim himself would be buried &#8220;like a donkey, dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). God turns human contempt on its head: though Uriah&#8217;s body lay among the poor, his witness lives on, while the king&#8217;s legacy is one of disgrace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm">Jeremiah 26:23</a> records more than a brutal extradition and execution. It exposes a ruler who refuses God&#8217;s warnings, a prophet who stands firm even unto death, and a God who preserves the testimony of truth despite human violence. Uriah&#8217;s fate demonstrates that rejecting the word of the Lord brings both immediate injustice and future judgment, while faithfulness&#8212;though costly&#8212;secures an eternal vindication that no sword can sever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And they fetched forth Urijah out of</span> <span class= "bld">Egypt.</span>--The martyr-death of the prophet had its parallels in the earlier history of Judah. So Jezebel had slain the prophets of Jehovah with the edge of the sword (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1Kings 18:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1Kings 19:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-14.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1Kings 19:14</a>), and Zechariah the son of Jehoiada had been stoned to death at the command of Joash (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-21.htm" title="And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.">2Chronicles 24:21</a>), and Isaiah, as the Jewish tradition runs, had been sawn asunder (<a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>). The fact now recorded was to Jewish feeling an act of brutal outrage. The body of the prophet was not allowed to rest in the sepulchre of his fathers, with the due honour of embalmment, but flung into the loathsome pits of "the sons of the people," in the Kidron valley (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm" title="And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.">2Kings 23:6</a>). It is not without interest to those who believe in a special as well as righteous retribution, to note the fact that the king who thus added brutality to cruelty was himself afterwards "buried with the burial of an ass," without honours or lamentations (<a href="/context/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>). For the phrase, "children of the people," see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/17-19.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:19</a>.
