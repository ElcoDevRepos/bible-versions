In the context of Jeremiah's prophetic ministry, it signifies spiritual and mental preparation. The Hebrew term used here can imply girding oneself, akin to preparing for battle, reflecting the seriousness of the task. This preparation is not just physical but involves a readiness to face opposition and deliver God's message faithfully.<p><b>Stand up and tell them everything that I command you.</b><br>Jeremiah is instructed to stand, a posture of authority and readiness to speak. This command underscores the prophet's role as God's mouthpiece, emphasizing obedience and the importance of delivering the message in its entirety. The phrase "everything that I command you" highlights the completeness and faithfulness required in conveying God's words, without alteration or omission. This mirrors the responsibility of prophets like Moses and later, the apostles, who were also tasked with delivering God's full message.<p><b>Do not be intimidated by them,</b><br>Jeremiah is warned against fear, a common human reaction when facing opposition or delivering unpopular messages. The people he is to address include kings, officials, priests, and the people of Judah, many of whom would be hostile to his message. This echoes God's assurance to other prophets, such as Ezekiel, who were also called to speak boldly despite potential threats. The call to courage is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in figures like Joshua, who was also encouraged to be strong and courageous.<p><b>or I will terrify you before them.</b><br>This phrase serves as a stern warning to Jeremiah about the consequences of succumbing to fear. It implies that failing to trust in God's protection and authority could lead to personal disgrace or failure. The fear of God, rather than fear of man, is a central biblical principle, reminding Jeremiah that his accountability is ultimately to God. This warning underscores the seriousness of the prophetic office and the need for unwavering faithfulness in the face of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
