The mention of camels becoming plunder indicates a significant loss of wealth and mobility for the people. This reflects the broader theme of divine judgment and the stripping away of resources as a consequence of sin. In biblical history, camels were associated with wealth, as seen in the story of Job (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), highlighting the severity of the loss.<p><b>and their large herds will be spoil</b><br>Large herds signify prosperity and sustenance. The loss of herds as spoil suggests a complete economic collapse and vulnerability to enemies. This phrase underscores the totality of the judgment, leaving the people without means of survival. The imagery of herds being taken is reminiscent of other biblical judgments where God allows enemies to strip away the resources of the disobedient, as seen in the plundering of Israel by the Midianites in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a>.<p><b>I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples</b><br>Shaving the temples was a practice associated with certain nomadic tribes, possibly the Dedanites or other Arabian groups, and was often linked to pagan rituals or mourning customs. The scattering "to the wind" implies a complete dispersion and loss of identity, similar to the scattering of Israel among the nations due to disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). This phrase highlights God's sovereignty in executing judgment and the futility of relying on cultural or religious practices contrary to His commands.<p><b>I will bring calamity on them from all sides,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>The declaration of calamity from all sides emphasizes the inescapable nature of divine judgment. It reflects the comprehensive nature of God's wrath against sin, as seen in other prophetic warnings (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/47-11.htm">Isaiah 47:11</a>). The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the certainty and authority of the prophecy, reminding readers of God's ultimate control over nations and history. This judgment serves as a warning to all who oppose God's will, pointing to the need for repentance and alignment with His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kedar.htm">Kedar</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe descended from Ishmael, known for their camels and tents.

When God says the invaders will seize these animals, He is stripping the people of their economic engine&#8212;much like Gideon&#8217;s Israel saw Midianite camel raiders ruin their harvests (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord has often aimed judgment at the very thing a nation trusts most; Babylon&#8217;s chariots were shattered (<a href="/jeremiah/51-21.htm">Jeremiah 51:21</a>), Philistia&#8217;s strong cities fell (<a href="/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6&#8211;8</a>). Here, the warning is clear: no matter how mobile or self&#8208;reliant we think we are, our resources are safe only under God&#8217;s protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and their large herds will be spoil</b><p>&#8226; Beyond camels, the &#8220;large herds&#8221; picture broad livestock wealth&#8212;sheep, goats, cattle. Abraham&#8217;s prosperity was measured in similar terms (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>), so losing flocks meant losing status, security, and daily provision.<p>&#8226; God had long promised that disobedience would turn blessing into spoil (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-31.htm">Deuteronomy 28:31</a>). The prophecy echoes Asa&#8217;s victory over the Cushites, when &#8220;they carried away a large amount of plunder, including sheep and goats and camels&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-14.htm">2 Chronicles 14:14</a>). What the Lord gives, He can reclaim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who shave their temples&#8221; identifies a desert custom (also noted in <a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>) that set these tribes apart. Rather than a harmless style choice, it symbolized a religious identity opposed to Israel&#8217;s covenant worship (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a> forbade similar cutting).<p>&#8226; Scattering &#8220;to the wind&#8221; fulfills earlier warnings: &#8220;I will scatter them like chaff on the desert wind&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/13-24.htm">Jeremiah 13:24</a>) and &#8220;I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/9-16.htm">Jeremiah 9:16</a>). The image is total dislocation&#8212;families uprooted, tribal cohesion dismantled, identity lost.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people today see a parallel: any defining marker that competes with allegiance to the Lord&#8212;whether cultural, ideological, or personal&#8212;cannot shelter us from His hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will bring calamity on them from all sides,</b> declares the LORD<p>&#8226; The attack is comprehensive.

He patiently warns, yet ultimately ensures that every nation answers to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a> dismantles Kedar and Hazor&#8217;s sense of security piece by piece: first their prized camels, then the broader herds, then their very community as they are scattered, and finally an inescapable, God&#8208;ordained calamity.
