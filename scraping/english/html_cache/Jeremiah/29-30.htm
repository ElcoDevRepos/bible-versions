It suggests that what follows is part of an ongoing narrative or series of communications from God to Jeremiah. This phrase often marks a transition in the prophetic narrative, emphasizing the immediacy and relevance of God's message.<p><b>the word of the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the message. In the Hebrew context, "the word of the LORD" is not just spoken words but carries the authority and power of God Himself. It is a common expression in the prophetic books, signifying that the message is not from human origin but directly from God. This phrase is foundational in understanding the role of prophets as messengers of God.<p><b>came to Jeremiah</b><br>Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," was called by God to deliver messages to the people of Judah during a tumultuous period. His ministry spanned the reigns of several kings and included warnings of impending judgment due to the people's unfaithfulness. The phrase indicates that Jeremiah is the chosen vessel for this divine communication, highlighting his role as a mediator between God and the people.
