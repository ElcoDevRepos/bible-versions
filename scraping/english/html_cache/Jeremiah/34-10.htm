The context is a covenant made during the reign of King Zedekiah, as described earlier in <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>. This covenant was a response to the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, a desperate attempt to seek God's favor by obeying His laws regarding the release of Hebrew slaves. The involvement of "all the officials and all the people" indicates a national commitment, reflecting the communal nature of ancient Israelite society where leaders and people were often united in religious and social reforms. This mirrors the covenantal structure seen throughout the Old Testament, where the entire community is bound by agreements made before God.<p><b>agreed that they would free their menservants and maidservants</b><br>The agreement to free Hebrew slaves is rooted in the Mosaic Law, specifically in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>, which commanded the release of Hebrew slaves after six years of service. This act of liberation was not merely a social reform but a religious obligation, reflecting God's deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt. The decision to free slaves during a time of crisis underscores the belief that obedience to God's commands could invoke His mercy and intervention. This act also prefigures the ultimate liberation found in Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>and no longer hold them in bondage</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the intended permanence of the release, aligning with the Jubilee principles found in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, where every fiftieth year, slaves were to be freed, and debts forgiven. The concept of not holding others in bondage resonates with the New Testament teachings of forgiveness and freedom in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Historically, this reflects a significant social and economic shift, as slavery was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. The call to release slaves was a radical step towards justice and equality, reflecting God's desire for His people to live in freedom and mutual respect.<p><b>They obeyed and released them</b><br>The initial obedience of the people and officials is noteworthy, as it demonstrates a willingness to align with God's commands, even at personal and economic cost. This act of obedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, where blessings are often contingent upon adherence to God's laws (Deuteronomy 28). However, the subsequent verses in <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a> reveal that this obedience was short-lived, as the people later reneged on their promise, leading to God's judgment. This serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of sustained faithfulness and integrity in one's commitments. The release of the slaves can also be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He releases humanity from the bondage of sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

This echoes earlier national gatherings where leaders and laity stood side-by-side to reaffirm God&#8217;s law (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1-3</a>). When an entire community unites around obedience, accountability rises; no one can claim ignorance or exemption (cf. <a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who entered into this covenant</b><p>The word &#8220;covenant&#8221; places the scene in solemn, binding territory. King Zedekiah initiated it (<a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8</a>), but the signatories pledged directly to the Lord, much like Israel did at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-7</a>). Breaking such a vow is not merely civil disobedience; it is spiritual treachery (<a href="/jeremiah/11-1.htm">Jeremiah 11:1-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Agreed that they would free their menservants and maidservants</b><p>The promise targets Hebrew debt-slaves who, according to the Law, should be released in the seventh year (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>). Centuries of neglect had turned a temporary safeguard into perpetual servitude. By &#8220;agreeing,&#8221; the people publicly acknowledged God&#8217;s original design for liberty (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>).<p>&#8226; Slavery in Israel was relief-oriented, not profit-driven.<p>&#8226; Freedom after six years reminded both master and servant that the LORD had redeemed Israel from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Failure to free these servants invited judgment, as Nehemiah later warned his generation (<a href="/nehemiah/5-8.htm">Nehemiah 5:8-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And no longer hold them in bondage</b><p>The phrase signals permanent release, not a token gesture. <a href="/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a> describes true fasting as &#8220;to let the oppressed go free,&#8221; and Jeremiah&#8217;s audience finally recognized that social righteousness cannot be postponed. Keeping fellow Israelites in bondage defied God&#8217;s redemption narrative (<a href="/jeremiah/34-13.htm">Jeremiah 34:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They obeyed and released them</b><p>For a brief, shining moment, obedience triumphed. Action validated intention; servants actually walked free. Scripture records this obedience to show how quickly hearts can respond when conviction meets courage (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-32.htm">2 Chronicles 34:32</a>).
