The title "LORD of Hosts" signifies God's command over the armies of heaven, indicating His supreme power. The "God of Israel" highlights His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel, reminding the audience of His faithfulness and the special bond He shares with His chosen people.<p><b>about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah</b><br>These individuals are identified as false prophets. The mention of their lineage serves to distinguish them from other figures with similar names and underscores their personal accountability. Ahab and Zedekiah were common names, but their association with false prophecy sets them apart in a negative light within the biblical narrative.<p><b>who are prophesying to you lies in My name</b><br>This phrase highlights the serious offense of false prophecy. Claiming to speak in God's name while delivering false messages is a grave sin, as it misleads the people and dishonors God. The Bible consistently condemns false prophets (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>), and this instance serves as a warning against those who would misuse divine authority for personal gain or deception.<p><b>I will deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>God's judgment is pronounced through the agency of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king. This reflects the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where God used foreign powers to execute His judgment on Israel for their disobedience. Nebuchadnezzar is a significant figure in biblical history, known for his conquests and the eventual destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>and he will kill them before your very eyes</b><br>The execution of Ahab and Zedekiah serves as a public demonstration of God's judgment against false prophets. This phrase underscores the seriousness of their sin and the certainty of divine retribution. It also serves as a warning to the exiled community in Babylon, reinforcing the importance of discerning true prophecy and remaining faithful to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab_son_of_kolaiah.htm">Ahab son of Kolaiah</a></b><br>A false prophet in Jerusalem who misled the people by prophesying lies in the name of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah_son_of_maaseiah.htm">Zedekiah son of Maaseiah</a></b><br>Another false prophet alongside Ahab, spreading deceitful messages to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar,_king_of_babylon.htm">Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon</a></b><br>The ruler of Babylon who was used by God as an instrument of judgment against the false prophets.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these false prophecies were being proclaimed, leading the people astray.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The sovereign God who pronounces judgment on the false prophets for their deceit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment and test the spirits to ensure that teachings align with Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_false_prophecy.htm">Consequences of False Prophecy</a></b><br>God takes false prophecy seriously, and there are severe consequences for those who lead others astray.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God uses even foreign rulers and nations to accomplish His purposes and execute judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>Upholding truth is crucial in our walk with God;

The record of the prediction of their fate implies its fulfilment. They were punished by the Chaldaean king as traitors and rebels, and were burnt alive. The history of the "three children" in <a href="/daniel/3-6.htm" title="And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-20.htm" title="And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.">Daniel 3:20</a>, shows that this was a sufficiently familiar punishment. A strange legend in the Targum of Rabbi Joseph on <a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.">2Chronicles 28:3</a> records that the future high-priest Joshua, the son of Jozedek, was thrown into the furnace with them, and came out uninjured (Smith's <span class= "ital">Dict, of the Bible, </span>Art. "Zedekiah"). We may, perhaps, trace the source of the legend in the figurative language of <a href="/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>, "Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?" The name Kolaiah (which admits of being derived from a verb meaning "roasting") possibly suggested the cruel mockery of a punishment which turned it into an omen of the false prophet's fate.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zedekiah</span>. The name is into-resting; it shows that this prophet belonged to a family which took pleasure in the thought of Jehovah and his righteousness. Doubtless, too, he did so himself; but he under-estimated the demands of that righteousness, which extended to the heart as well as to the outward conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">about</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ahab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Kolaiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6964.htm">Strong's 6964: </a> </span><span class="str2">Kolaiah -- 'voice of Yah', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
