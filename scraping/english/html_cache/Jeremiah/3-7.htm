The "she" refers to the northern kingdom of Israel, which had engaged in idolatry and other sins. Despite their transgressions, God anticipated their return, highlighting His patience and willingness to forgive. This expectation is consistent with God's character throughout the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where God invites His people to reason together and find forgiveness. The phrase underscores the theme of repentance and God's desire for a restored relationship with His people.<p><b>But she did not return,</b><br>Israel's failure to return to God despite His expectations is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. This reflects the stubbornness and hardness of heart that characterized the northern kingdom, leading to their eventual exile by the Assyrians in 722 BC. The lack of repentance serves as a warning to others about the consequences of persistent disobedience. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus laments over Jerusalem's unwillingness to come to Him (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, is described as "unfaithful," indicating that they followed in the footsteps of Israel's idolatry and sin. Despite witnessing the consequences of Israel's actions, Judah failed to learn from them and continued in similar patterns of disobedience. This highlights the theme of accountability and the importance of learning from the mistakes of others. The relationship between Israel and Judah is often used to illustrate the broader spiritual condition of God's people. The phrase also foreshadows Judah's own exile to Babylon, as detailed in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
