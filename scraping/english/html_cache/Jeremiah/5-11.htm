After Solomon's reign, the kingdom split into the northern kingdom (Israel) and the southern kingdom (Judah). This division is significant in understanding the context of Jeremiah's prophecies, as both kingdoms had turned away from God, leading to their eventual downfall. The mention of both houses underscores the comprehensive nature of the people's unfaithfulness, affecting the entire nation that was chosen by God.<p><b>have been utterly unfaithful to Me,&#8221;</b><br>The term "utterly unfaithful" indicates a complete and pervasive betrayal of the covenant relationship between God and His people. This unfaithfulness is characterized by idolatry, social injustice, and a general abandonment of the laws given through Moses. The prophets, including Jeremiah, frequently called out this unfaithfulness, warning of impending judgment. This phrase highlights the severity of the people's actions, which were not just occasional lapses but a systemic rejection of God's commands.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. It is a common prophetic formula that signifies the words are not Jeremiah's own but are directly from God. This divine declaration serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the seriousness of the pronouncement. It also connects to other prophetic writings where similar declarations are made, reinforcing the consistency of God's message through His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Israel.

The people chose those very paths.<p>&#8226; Hosea portrays such unfaithfulness as spiritual adultery (<a href="/bsb/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1&#8211;3</a>).
