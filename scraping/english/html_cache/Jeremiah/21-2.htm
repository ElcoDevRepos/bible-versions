In the context of ancient Israel, seeking a prophet to inquire of the LORD was a common practice, especially in times of crisis. Jeremiah, as a prophet, served as a mediator between God and the people. This reflects the Israelites' understanding of God as sovereign and capable of influencing the outcome of events. The request also shows a reliance on the prophetic office, which was established in Israel to communicate God's will.<p><b>since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was the king of Babylon from 605 to 562 BC and is known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His siege of Jerusalem was a significant historical event, leading to the eventual fall of the city in 586 BC. This phrase highlights the immediate threat faced by Judah and the desperation of the people. Historically, this period was marked by political instability and shifting alliances, with Babylon emerging as a dominant power after defeating the Assyrians and Egyptians.<p><b>Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonders</b><br>This reflects a hope rooted in the history of Israel, where God performed miraculous acts to deliver His people, such as the Exodus from Egypt and victories in battles under leaders like Joshua and David. The phrase suggests a belief in God's ability to intervene supernaturally. It also implies a recognition of God's past faithfulness and power, which the people hoped would be demonstrated again in their current crisis.<p><b>so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us</b><br>The desired outcome of the inquiry is the withdrawal of Babylonian forces, indicating a hope for deliverance without the need for military engagement. This reflects a reliance on divine intervention rather than human strength or strategy. Historically, the withdrawal of an invading army would have been seen as a sign of divine favor and protection. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to alter the course of history for the sake of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

This reflects a belief that God speaks and acts decisively through His chosen messengers, just as Moses stood between Israel and Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/8-8.htm">Exodus 8:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; The request echoes earlier moments when leaders sought a word from God in crisis&#8212;e.g., Josiah in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-21.htm">2 Chronicles 34:21</a> and Hezekiah in <a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1-4</a>. Each time, the underlying conviction is that the Lord hears and answers.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently portrays prayer as the first resort, not the last (<a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>; <a href="/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13-15</a>). Zedekiah&#8217;s appeal acknowledges that human strength cannot solve a spiritual problem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us</b><p>&#8226; The threat is real, present, and humanly overwhelming (<a href="/jeremiah/32-1.htm">Jeremiah 32:1-2</a>). Babylon&#8217;s siege engines surround Jerusalem, fulfilling earlier warnings (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>).<p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar is not merely a political foe; he is God&#8217;s chosen instrument of judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>). Recognizing this shifts the focus from military strategy to spiritual condition.<p>&#8226; The verse underlines a timeless truth: national crises often expose deeper issues of covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Perhaps the LORD will perform for us something like all His past wonders</b><p>&#8226; The plea recalls the Red Sea deliverance (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-31</a>), the sun standing still under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>), and the miraculous defeat of Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-36</a>). God&#8217;s track record fuels hope.<p>&#8226; Yet &#8220;perhaps&#8221; signals uncertainty. Miracles are sovereign gifts, not contractual guarantees (<a href="/daniel/3-17.htm">Daniel 3:17-18</a>). The people want the benefits of covenant blessings without covenant obedience (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-11</a>).<p>&#8226; This tension highlights the character of God: He is mighty to save, but He is also holy and just (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). Wonders are tied to repentance, not to wishful thinking (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us</b><p>&#8226; The desired outcome is political relief, not necessarily spiritual renewal. Zedekiah seeks a change in circumstance without a change in heart (<a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3, 9</a>-10).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s reply through Jeremiah (21:3-7) is sobering: Babylon will not withdraw; instead, the city will fall. Divine judgment will proceed because the people refuse to turn from their sins (<a href="/jeremiah/18-11.htm">Jeremiah 18:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode reminds us that deliverance and discipline both serve God&#8217;s redemptive purposes (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). Mercy is offered, yet it never nullifies righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a> captures a desperate appeal: &#8220;We&#8217;re under siege&#8212;ask God to do another miracle.&#8221; Each phrase reveals layers of truth. Seeking divine help is right, but treating God as a crisis manager while disregarding His commands is futile. The verse warns that past wonders do not guarantee present rescue when hearts remain unrepentant. God is still able to save, yet He will not be manipulated. Genuine turning to Him&#8212;trust linked with obedience&#8212;remains the only path to lasting deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Nebuchadrezzar.</span>--This form of the name, as might be expected in the writings of one who was personally brought into contact with the king and his officers, is more correct than that of Nebuchadnezzar, which we find elsewhere, and even in Jeremiah's own writings (<a href="/jeremiah/34-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm" title="But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 39:5</a>).<p>The name has been variously interpreted by scholars as "Nebo protects against misfortune," "Nebo protects the land-marks," "Nebo protects the crown," or "Fire, the shining God."<p><span class= "bld">If so be that the Lord will deal with us . . .</span>--The messengers come to inquire of the prophet, and yet suggest the answer which he is expected to give. Jehovah is to show His wondrous works in the deliverance of the city. The history of Sennacherib's army (2 Kings 19; Isaiah 37) was probably present to their minds. It was apparently an attempt on the part of the king and his counsellors, under the show of a devout reverence, to entice Jeremiah to change his tone and side with the policy of resistance to the Chaldaeans. In <a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.">Jeremiah 37:3</a> we have another like mission, coming apparently at a somewhat later date in the reign of Zedekiah<p><span class= "bld">That he may go up from us.</span>--i.e., in modern phraseology, that he may "raise the siege."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadrezzar</span>.
