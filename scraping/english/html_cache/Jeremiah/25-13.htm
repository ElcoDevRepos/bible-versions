The "land" refers to Judah and Jerusalem, which were under threat due to their disobedience and idolatry. The pronouncement of judgment is a common theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing God's justice and the consequences of sin. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>all that is written in this book</b><br>The "book" refers to the scroll of Jeremiah's prophecies, which includes warnings of destruction and exile. This highlights the importance of written prophecy as a record of God's word and a testament to His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. The preservation of these writings underscores the authority and reliability of Scripture. The reference to "this book" also points to the broader canon of Scripture, where God's plans and purposes are revealed progressively.<p><b>which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations</b><br>Jeremiah's prophecies were not limited to Judah but extended to surrounding nations, indicating God's sovereignty over all peoples. This universal scope of judgment reflects the biblical theme that God is the Lord of all the earth, not just Israel. The inclusion of other nations in Jeremiah's prophecies serves as a reminder of the accountability of all nations to God's moral order. It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of the gospel's reach to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Judah and the surrounding nations that were subject to God's judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book.htm">The Book</a></b><br>This refers to the scroll of Jeremiah's prophecies, which includes warnings and judgments against Judah and other nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Various nations surrounding Judah, including Babylon, Egypt, and others, which were also subject to God's judgment as prophesied by Jeremiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The event of divine retribution that God promises to bring upon the nations for their sins, as articulated through Jeremiah's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_word.htm">The Certainty of God's Word</a></b><br>God's promises and warnings are sure and will come to pass.

He is not delegating judgment; He Himself will act. Just as <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10-11</a> reminds us that His purpose will stand, so here He pledges to carry it out. The &#8220;land&#8221; first points to Judah, whose people had ignored repeated warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/7-23.htm">Jeremiah 7:23-26</a>), but it also anticipates the foreign nations listed later in the chapter. Because <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> says God does not lie or change His mind, this statement carries absolute certainty.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s hand is active in both blessing and discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; He watches over His word to perform it (<a href="/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the words I have pronounced against it</b><p>The judgment will match every syllable already spoken.

By rooting His promise in Scripture, He highlights its permanence (<a href="/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>). Even when King Jehoiakim burned Jeremiah&#8217;s first scroll, the LORD had it rewritten with &#8220;many similar words added&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-32.htm">Jeremiah 36:32</a>), underscoring that no human act can erase divine truth. Second Peter 1:19-21 later affirms that prophecy originates as men are &#8220;carried along by the Holy Spirit,&#8221; giving this book unassailable authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18-19</a> shows the seriousness of tampering with the written Word&#8212;God protects what He has inspired.<p>&#8226; Because it is written, it will happen exactly as promised (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations</b><p>The scope widens beyond Judah. Beginning in <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> and expanded in chapters 46-51, the prophet names Egypt, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Elam, and especially Babylon. <a href="/bsb/amos/1.htm">Amos 1-2</a> follows a similar pattern, demonstrating that the LORD is sovereign over every people. <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> foreshadows this principle: those who oppose God&#8217;s plan face His curse.<p>&#8226; Babylon, the very instrument of Judah&#8217;s exile, would itself fall (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24-26</a>), fulfilled when Cyrus conquered the city in 539 BC.<p>&#8226; The universal reach of God&#8217;s justice anticipates the final judgment of the nations pictured in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/25-13.htm">Jeremiah 25:13</a> assures us that God will unfailingly execute every word He has spoken.

It should be mentioned that the Septuagint separates the last clause of the verse, "that which Jeremiah prophesied," etc., and makes it the heading of the group of prophecies against the nations, which in the Hebrew Bible stand at the end of Jeremiah's prophecies, but which, beginning with "Elam," the Alexandrian Version inserts at this point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1461;&#1469;&#1489;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
