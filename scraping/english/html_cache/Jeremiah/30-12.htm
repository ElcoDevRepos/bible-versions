It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the words are not Jeremiah's own but are directly from God. This establishes the seriousness and certainty of the message, as it comes from the ultimate authority.<p><b>Your injury is incurable;</b><br>The term "incurable" suggests a condition beyond human remedy, indicating the severity of Israel's spiritual and moral state. Historically, this reflects the period of Babylonian exile, where the nation faced destruction and displacement due to persistent sin and rebellion against God. Theologically, it points to the depth of human sinfulness, which cannot be healed by human means but requires divine intervention.<p><b>your wound is grievous.</b><br>The "wound" symbolizes the consequences of sin and disobedience, which have led to suffering and judgment. In the context of Jeremiah, it refers to the devastation brought by foreign powers as a result of Israel's covenant unfaithfulness. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, where sin is often depicted as a disease or injury. It also foreshadows the need for a Savior, as only through Christ can the ultimate healing and restoration be achieved, fulfilling the deeper spiritual need that physical healing alone cannot address.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse opens with a reminder that what follows is not Jeremiah&#8217;s opinion but the direct word of God. Whenever Scripture uses this formula (for example, <a href="/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>), it underscores the absolute authority behind the statement.<p>&#8226; By placing God&#8217;s voice front-and-center, the text calls Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;to listen with reverence. <a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a> notes, &#8220;For He spoke, and it came to be,&#8221; highlighting that His words both diagnose and accomplish His purposes.<p>&#8226; This divine preface also sets the verse in the larger context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/30.htm">Jeremiah 30&#8211;31</a>, where God promises both judgment and future restoration. Thus, whatever hard truth He is about to state is ultimately part of His redemptive plan (<a href="/jeremiah/30-11.htm">Jeremiah 30:11</a>; 31:3).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your injury is incurable</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;injury&#8221; pictures the nation&#8217;s sin-fractured condition. Jeremiah earlier likened Judah&#8217;s rebellion to an illness no human could heal (<a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>; 17:9).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Incurable&#8221; stresses that, left to themselves, God&#8217;s people have no remedy. Like the oil-soaked rags of <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, their own efforts only deepen the stain.<p>&#8226; Cross references reinforce the hopelessness of self-reform: &#8220;Woe to the sinful nation&#8230; from the sole of the foot to the head there is no soundness&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-6</a>); &#8220;Ephraim saw his sickness&#8230; but he could not heal you&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this diagnosis prepares the way for God&#8217;s eventual intervention. <a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a> will declare, &#8220;For I will restore health to you,&#8221; showing that the God who says the wound is incurable is also the only One who can cure it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your wound is grievous</b><p>&#8226; The second image intensifies the first: the nation&#8217;s wound is not only beyond repair but also &#8220;grievous&#8221;&#8212;painful, festering, life-threatening. <a href="/jeremiah/10-19.htm">Jeremiah 10:19</a> laments, &#8220;My wound is grievous, yet I must bear it,&#8221; capturing the anguish of divine chastening.<p>&#8226; Human allies prove useless: &#8220;There is no one to plead your cause&#8230; you have no healing medicines&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-13.htm">Jeremiah 30:13</a>). This echoes the futile political alliances condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36-37</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose in letting the wound run deep is to strip away every false hope, so that His people cry to Him alone (<a href="/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17-20</a>). <a href="/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6-7</a> parallels this: &#8220;I will gather the lame&#8230; the remnant whom I have afflicted.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The severity of the wound also foreshadows the atoning work of Christ, who &#8220;was pierced for our transgressions&#8230; by His wounds we are healed&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>). What is humanly incurable finds its remedy at the cross.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/30-12.htm">Jeremiah 30:12</a> confronts Israel&#8212;and every sinner&#8212;with a sobering verdict: our rebellion has left us mortally wounded, utterly beyond self-repair. By prefacing the diagnosis with &#8220;For this is what the LORD says,&#8221; God asserts His right to expose the depth of the problem. Declaring the injury &#8220;incurable&#8221; and the wound &#8220;grievous&#8221; shuts the door on all human fixes and opens the door to divine grace. The same chapter that pronounces the disease (v. 12) promises the cure (v. 17), culminating in the New Covenant of <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>.
