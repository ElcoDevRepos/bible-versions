In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/34.htm">Jeremiah 34</a>, the people of Judah initially obeyed God's command to release their Hebrew slaves, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-12.htm">Deuteronomy 15:12-18</a>). However, their change of heart reflects a deeper spiritual issue of disobedience and rebellion against God's covenant. This mirrors the broader theme in Jeremiah of Judah's unfaithfulness and the consequences of breaking covenant promises.<p><b>and took back the menservants and maidservants they had freed</b><br>The act of taking back the freed servants is a direct violation of the covenant made before God. In ancient Israel, the release of Hebrew slaves was not only a legal obligation but also a moral and spiritual one, symbolizing liberation and justice. This reversal of action demonstrates a lack of integrity and respect for God's laws. It also reflects the social and economic pressures of the time, where the loss of labor could have been seen as a significant economic disadvantage, prompting the people to reclaim their servants.<p><b>and they forced them to become slaves again</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of the people's actions, as they not only reneged on their promise but actively oppressed those they had set free. This act of re-enslavement is a grave injustice and is condemned by God through the prophet Jeremiah. It serves as a reminder of the importance of justice and mercy, themes that are prevalent throughout the Bible (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the bondage of sin, from which Christ frees believers (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>; <a href="/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17-18</a>). The failure of the people to uphold their covenant reflects humanity's need for a Savior who can truly liberate from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of Jeremiah.

Their &#8220;change of mind&#8221; shows a heart that repented of obedience rather than of sin&#8212;a reversal that echoes <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against breaking vows made before God. By turning back, they treated their covenant with the LORD as negotiable, something <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> calls &#8220;double-minded.&#8221;<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Obedience delayed or withdrawn is disobedience (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Covenants matter to God; breaking one invites His displeasure (<a href="/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18-20</a>; <a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode exposes the danger of momentary remorse without lasting repentance (<a href="/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And took back the menservants and maidservants they had freed</b><p>The leaders physically reclaimed those they had just released, nullifying the liberty God required.

Their seizure of freed people demonstrates:<p>&#8226; A disregard for human dignity rooted in creation (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; A dismissal of God&#8217;s written word in favor of economic self-interest (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; A willingness to oppress the vulnerable, contradicting <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>: &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they forced them to become slaves again</b><p>Re-enslaving their brethren turned covenant grace into renewed bondage. God defines that act as evil in <a href="/jeremiah/34-16.htm">Jeremiah 34:16-17</a>, promising the sword, pestilence, and famine in response. The refusal to grant Sabbath rest to others invites judgment akin to Israel&#8217;s exile for ignoring Sabbath years (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>).
