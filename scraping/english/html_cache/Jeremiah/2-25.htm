In ancient times, going barefoot was often a sign of poverty, shame, or mourning. The imagery here implies that Israel's pursuit of foreign gods would lead to their spiritual and physical destitution. The feet symbolize one's path or way of life, and the admonition is to avoid the path that leads to ruin. This echoes the call to walk in the ways of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>, where obedience to God's commandments is linked to prosperity and life.<p><b>and your throat from being thirsty.</b><br>Thirst is a metaphor for spiritual longing and need. In the context of Jeremiah, it represents Israel's unfulfilled desires due to their pursuit of false gods. The thirst could also symbolize the nation's unmet spiritual needs, which only the true God can satisfy, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, where God invites the thirsty to come to the waters. This reflects the futility of seeking satisfaction in anything other than God, a theme also present in Jesus' conversation with the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>, where He offers living water that quenches all thirst.<p><b>But you said, &#8216;It is hopeless!</b><br>This expression of despair indicates a resignation to sin and idolatry. The people of Israel felt trapped in their circumstances, believing that returning to God was impossible. This reflects a lack of faith in God's power to redeem and restore, contrasting with the biblical message of hope and repentance. In <a href="/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>, the exiled Israelites express a similar hopelessness, yet God promises to open their graves and bring them back to the land of Israel, symbolizing spiritual revival.<p><b>For I love foreign gods,</b><br>This confession reveals the heart of Israel's apostasy: a love for foreign deities. The allure of these gods often came with the promise of prosperity, fertility, and protection, appealing to the Israelites' desires. This love for foreign gods is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and reflects the spiritual adultery that the prophets frequently condemned. The attraction to foreign gods is also a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in the story of Solomon, whose heart was turned away by his foreign wives and their gods (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p><b>and I must go after them.</b><br>This phrase indicates a compulsion or determination to pursue idolatry, despite knowing its futility. It highlights the depth of Israel's spiritual bondage and the power of sin to enslave. The language of pursuit suggests a relentless chase, akin to the waywardness described in <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>, where Israel is depicted as an unfaithful wife chasing after her lovers. This pursuit of foreign gods is contrasted with the call to seek the Lord with all one's heart, as promised in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where God assures that those who seek Him will find Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Jehovah, as her true husband, bids the apostate wife to refrain for very shame from acting as the harlot, rushing barefoot into the streets, panting, as with a thirst that craves to be quenched, for the gratification of her desires. The "unshod" may possibly refer to one feature of the worship of Baal or Ashtaroth, men and women taking off their shoes when they entered into their temples, as being holy ground (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm" title="And he said, Draw not near here: put off your shoes from off your feet, for the place where on you stand is holy ground.">Exodus 3:5</a>), and joining in orgiastic dances.<p><span class= "bld">Thou saidst, There is no hope: no.</span>--Here also we find a parallel to the thought and language of Hosea.
