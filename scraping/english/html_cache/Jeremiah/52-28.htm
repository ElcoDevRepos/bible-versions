The deportation of the Jews was a significant event in biblical history, marking the beginning of the Babylonian Exile. This was a fulfillment of the prophecies given by Jeremiah and other prophets, warning of the consequences of Israel's disobedience and idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). The exile served as a period of purification and reflection for the Jewish people, emphasizing God's sovereignty and justice.<p><b>in the seventh year,</b><br>The "seventh year" refers to the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, which is historically dated to around 598/597 BC. This was the first major deportation of Jews to Babylon, following Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Jerusalem. The timing is significant as it aligns with the historical records of Babylonian campaigns and provides a chronological anchor for the events described in the Book of Jeremiah.<p><b>3,023 Jews;</b><br>The specific number of 3,023 Jews deported highlights the precision of the biblical record. This figure represents a portion of the population, likely including the leaders, skilled workers, and craftsmen, as mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>. The deportation was part of Nebuchadnezzar's strategy to weaken the political and economic structure of Judah, ensuring control over the region. This number also reflects the beginning of the Jewish community in Babylon, which would later play a crucial role in preserving Jewish identity and faith during the exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who led the conquest of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people.

Scripture repeatedly affirms that the exile happened at the word of the LORD because Judah rejected His covenant (<a href="/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13-14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>).<p>&#8211; The phrase highlights that the deportations were personal and painful: families uprooted, leaders humbled, worship disrupted (<a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17-20</a>).<p>&#8211; God is still sovereign in the chaos. He promised judgment through Babylon, yet also pledged restoration after seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>). The captivity is both discipline and a stage for future hope (<a href="/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the seventh year</b><p>&#8211; Babylonian records date Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s seventh regnal year to 598/597 BC, matching the second exile of Judah (<a href="/2_kings/24-11.htm">2 Kings 24:11-12</a>).<p>&#8211; This precision confirms the reliability of Jeremiah&#8217;s chronicle; the Bible is not mythic lore but anchored in verifiable moments of history.<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s timing is purposeful: seven often signals completeness. Judah had ignored seventy sabbath-years of rest for the land (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). Now, in the king&#8217;s seventh year, judgment advances toward its full course, underscoring that God&#8217;s calendar will not be mocked (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>3,023 Jews</b><p>&#8211; The headcount shows that the Lord notes every person; exile was not random statistics. &#8220;The LORD knows those who are His&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Most went into Babylon, but a remnant stayed to keep the flame of faith alive in the land (<a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7-10</a>). God always preserves a faithful lineage, preparing for Messiah&#8217;s coming (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>).<p>&#8211; The exact figure also answers skeptics who claim the Bible inflates events. Later verses total 4,600 captives over three deportations (<a href="/jeremiah/52-29.htm">Jeremiah 52:29-30</a>), which aligns with the numbers of skilled leaders and nobles listed elsewhere (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>). Counting men of influence separately from the general populace explains why the numbers are smaller than the multitudes implied in <a href="/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-4</a>; both records are true, just measuring different groups.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28</a> is a concise census that validates God&#8217;s prophetic warnings and His meticulous care for His covenant people. It roots the exile in real time (the seventh year), real numbers (3,023), and a real conqueror (Nebuchadnezzar), proving that every word the LORD speaks comes to pass and assuring believers that His promises of discipline and eventual restoration can be trusted with equal certainty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/52.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">This is the people . . .</span>--Here the parallelism with 2 Kings 25, which goes on to give a brief summary of the history of Gedaliah and Ishmael, as narrated in Jeremiah 40-43, ceases, and the writer of the appendix goes on to give particulars as to the various stages of the deportation of the captives. It presents some difficulties in detail. (1) The date given here, the "seventh year" of Nebuchadnezzar, does not agree with <a href="/2_kings/24-12.htm" title="And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.">2Kings 24:12</a>, which gives the "eighth year" as the time of the first deportation after the defeat of Jehoiachin. (2) The number of the captives then carried into exile, given in <a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm" title="And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.">2Kings 24:14</a> at 10,000, besides the craftsmen and the smiths, is given here as 3,023. The precision of the number seems to imply reference to a register or record of some kind, and so far bears <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>evidence of accuracy. Probably the word "ten" has dropped out before "seven," and we have here the record of a second deportation in the <span class= "ital">seventeenth </span>year of Nebuchadnezzar, while the siege of Jerusalem was going on, and made up in part of prisoners taken in skirmishes, and partly of the numerous Jews who "fell away to the Chaldaeans" (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seventh year.</span> As Ewald and Keil agree, we should correct "seventh" into "seventeenth" (just as in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>, for "eight" we should read "eighteen"). On the small number of Jews deported Ewald remarks, "Nothing so clearly shows the extent to which the best men from the upper classes had been already despatched by the Chaldeans across the Euphrates, as the fact that in all the years of the second, and, if it be insisted on, of the third revolt, put together, they found only 4600 men more whom they thought worth the trouble of transporting" ('History of Israel,' 4:265). As to the third deportation, see on Jeremiah 41:1. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
