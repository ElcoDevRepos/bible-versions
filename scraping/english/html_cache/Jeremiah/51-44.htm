The punishment of Bel signifies God's judgment against the idolatry and false gods of Babylon. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and their gods, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>, where the futility of idols is highlighted. Historically, the fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians in 539 BC marked the fulfillment of this prophecy, demonstrating God's control over historical events.<p><b>I will make him spew out what he swallowed.</b><br>This phrase symbolizes the reversal of Babylon's conquests and plundering of other nations. The imagery of spewing out suggests a forceful expulsion of what was unjustly taken, indicating divine retribution. This can be connected to the principle of divine justice found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>, where it is stated that what a nation has done will be done to them. The historical context of Babylon's wealth and power, accumulated through conquest, underscores the significance of this divine act of restitution.<p><b>The nations will no longer stream to him;</b><br>Babylon was a center of commerce, culture, and power, attracting people from various nations. This phrase indicates a cessation of Babylon's influence and allure, a direct consequence of God's judgment. The imagery of nations streaming to Babylon can be contrasted with the prophetic vision in <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>, where nations stream to the mountain of the Lord, highlighting the shift from earthly power to divine authority. The historical decline of Babylon's influence after its conquest aligns with this prophecy.<p><b>even the wall of Babylon will fall.</b><br>The wall of Babylon was renowned for its strength and grandeur, symbolizing the city's might and security. The fall of this wall represents the complete overthrow of Babylon's defenses and the futility of relying on human strength against divine judgment. This echoes the biblical theme of the fall of human pride, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction." Archaeological evidence of Babylon's ruins today serves as a testament to the fulfillment of this prophecy, emphasizing the transient nature of earthly power in contrast to God's eternal sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bel.htm">Bel</a></b><br>A title for the Babylonian god Marduk, representing the idolatry and false worship prevalent in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God&#8217;s people.

The Living God is not just judging a city; He is personally confronting its idol.<p>&#8226; Earlier, the prophet announced, &#8220;Babylon is captured; Bel is put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>), and Isaiah had pictured Bel toppling from his pedestal (<a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>). Those words underline the same theme: every false god will bow before the Lord.<p>&#8226; When Cyrus took Babylon in 539 BC, Bel&#8217;s vast temple treasury was seized, exposing the impotence of the idol and vindicating the prophetic word spoken decades earlier.<p>&#8226; Takeaway: God&#8217;s supremacy is total. Wherever idolatry sets itself up&#8212;ancient Babylon or modern substitutes&#8212;He promises to act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make him spew out what he swallowed</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues, &#8220;I will make him spew out what he swallowed.&#8221; Babylon had been gulping down the wealth and sacred vessels of conquered nations (<a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had compared Nebuchadnezzar to a monster that &#8220;swallowed me&#8221; and later &#8220;vomited me out&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>). Now the Lord declares the moment of forced regurgitation.<p>&#8226; History records it: Cyrus ordered that the temple articles taken from Jerusalem be returned (<a href="/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7-11</a>). What Babylon&#8217;s god had &#8220;swallowed,&#8221; God made him disgorge.<p>&#8226; Application: Every theft, every injustice, every cruel seizure will ultimately be reversed by the righteous Judge. He sees, remembers, and repays.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The nations will no longer stream to him</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The nations will no longer stream to him.&#8221; Babylon&#8217;s shrine had been an international pilgrimage center, drawing tributes and worshipers. That traffic would dry up overnight.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah had foreseen this end: &#8220;All the nations shall serve him [Nebuchadnezzar]&#8230; until the time of his own land comes&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>). That time arrived, cutting off the flow.<p>&#8226; Zechariah later called God&#8217;s people to &#8220;Escape&#8230; you who dwell with Daughter Babylon!&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/2-7.htm">Zechariah 2:7</a>). Revelation echoes the same cry when spiritual Babylon collapses (<a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Truth to embrace: God breaks the spell of counterfeit worship. When He exposes an idol, its magnetism evaporates, and captives are set free.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even the wall of Babylon will fall</b><p>&#8226; The verse finishes, &#8220;even the wall of Babylon will fall.&#8221; Ancient writers marveled at those walls&#8212;more than 80 feet thick in places, stretching for miles.<p>&#8226; Yet Jeremiah had already proclaimed, &#8220;The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-58.htm">Jeremiah 51:58</a>), and Isaiah said the city would be overthrown &#8220;like Sodom and Gomorrah&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>).<p>&#8226; In 539 BC the Medo-Persian army entered the city virtually unopposed, rendering those legendary fortifications useless. Later rulers dismantled great sections for building materials&#8212;another quiet fulfillment of the prophetic word.<p>&#8226; Lesson: No fortress, corporation, ideology, or regime can stand when God decrees its fall. Dependence on human strongholds is misplaced security.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a> unfolds like four rapid-fire verdicts: God will topple Babylon&#8217;s idol, force restitution, drain away its global influence, and demolish its defenses. Each line proved literally true in history, underscoring that every promise of divine judgment and deliverance can be trusted today. The passage calls us to renounce every modern &#8220;Bel,&#8221; rest in the Lord&#8217;s justice, and stake our security on the only kingdom that cannot fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">And I will punish Bel in Babylon.</span>--See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm" title="Declare you among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.">Jeremiah 50:2</a>.

The two great walls of the city bore, as has been stated above, the names of Imgur-Bel (= Bel protects) and Nimetti-Bel (= the dwelling of Bel), and were thus specially consecrated to him as their tutelary deity (Oppert, <span class= "ital">Expedit. en Mesop., </span>i. p. 227; <span class= "ital">Records of the Past, </span>v. 124).
