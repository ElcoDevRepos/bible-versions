The imagery of archers surrounding the city suggests a siege, a common military tactic in ancient warfare. Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was a dominant empire known for its wealth and power. The call to "all you who draw the bow" indicates a coalition of forces, possibly referring to the Medes and Persians who historically conquered Babylon. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies against Babylon, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17-19</a>, where God uses foreign nations as instruments of His judgment.<p><b>Shoot at her!</b><br>The command to "shoot" emphasizes the intensity and aggression of the attack. In ancient warfare, archers played a crucial role in weakening the enemy from a distance before a ground assault. This directive underscores the certainty of Babylon's downfall, as prophesied by Jeremiah. The act of shooting can also symbolize divine retribution, where God uses human armies to execute His judgment, as seen in other biblical narratives like the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6).<p><b>Spare no arrows!</b><br>This phrase indicates a total and unrelenting assault, leaving no room for mercy or restraint. It highlights the completeness of the judgment against Babylon, ensuring that nothing is held back. The use of all available resources in battle signifies the seriousness of Babylon's offenses. This mirrors the biblical principle that God's judgment is thorough and just, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>For she has sinned against the LORD.</b><br>The reason for the attack is Babylon's sin against God. Babylon was notorious for its idolatry, pride, and oppression of God's people, particularly during the Babylonian captivity of Judah. This sin is not just against other nations but directly against the LORD, highlighting the moral and spiritual dimensions of Babylon's offenses. The phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where nations are held accountable for their actions, as seen in the judgment of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). Theologically, it underscores the idea that sin has consequences and that God's holiness demands justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant empire in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its wealth, power, and idolatry.

The picture is military precision, not random violence&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s doom is orchestrated by the LORD Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3, 9</a>; 51:2). Comparable scenes of nations being mustered for judgment appear in <a href="/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4&#8211;5</a> and <a href="/revelation/17-17.htm">Revelation 17:17</a>, underscoring that when God decrees judgment, He also directs the means by which it comes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all you who draw the bow</b><p>Archers are specifically called up, highlighting an attack from a distance as well as close-in combat (<a href="/jeremiah/50-29.htm">Jeremiah 50:29</a>; 51:3). Babylon once boasted invincible walls, yet even those defenses will not stop arrows guided by divine purpose. <a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a> reminds us that &#8220;unless the LORD guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain,&#8221; and here Babylon&#8217;s watchmen will fail because God has ordered it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shoot at her!</b><p>The command turns from positioning to action.

Holding nothing back means Babylon&#8217;s fall will be swift and complete (<a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>).

Half-measures would misrepresent God&#8217;s holiness; full justice must match the full measure of her guilt (<a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For she has sinned against the LORD</b><p>Here is the core reason: Babylon&#8217;s arrogance, idolatry, and cruelty toward God&#8217;s people have stacked up to heaven (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>). Sin is never abstract; it is personal rebellion against the covenant-keeping God. <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> promised blessing for those who bless Israel and cursing for those who curse her; Babylon chose the curse and now reaps its harvest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/50-14.htm">Jeremiah 50:14</a> calls every archer to surround, shoot, and exhaust their ammunition against Babylon because her sin is flagrant before the LORD.
