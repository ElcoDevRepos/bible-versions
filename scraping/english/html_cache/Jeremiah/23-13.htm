The prophets in this region were often influenced by the surrounding pagan cultures. The division between the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah) after Solomon's reign led to distinct religious practices, with Samaria frequently falling into idolatry. This context highlights the spiritual decline and the syncretism that plagued the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>I saw an offensive thing:</b><br>The term "offensive" indicates something detestable or abominable in the sight of God. This reflects God's holiness and His intolerance for idolatry and false prophecy. The prophets' actions were not just errors but were deeply offensive to God, violating the covenant relationship He had with Israel.<p><b>They prophesied by Baal</b><br>Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, often worshipped through rituals that included immoral practices. The prophets' invocation of Baal signifies a direct violation of the First Commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods. This syncretism was a recurring issue, as seen in the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18).<p><b>and led My people Israel astray.</b><br>The role of a prophet was to guide the people in God's truth, but these prophets led Israel into idolatry and away from the covenant. This phrase underscores the responsibility of spiritual leaders and the severe consequences of their failure. The theme of leading astray is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God condemns the shepherds of Israel for neglecting their duties.
