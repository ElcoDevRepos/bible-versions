This practice is seen in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>, where Job shaves his head in response to his great losses. The shaving of the head symbolized deep grief and was often a public display of lamentation. In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, this act signifies the profound sorrow and disgrace that would come upon Moab due to God's judgment.<p><b>and every beard is clipped</b><br>Clipping the beard was another expression of mourning and shame. In the ancient world, a full beard was a sign of dignity and honor for men. To cut or clip the beard was to remove that honor, indicating a state of distress or disgrace. This practice is also mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>, where the people of Moab are described as shaving their heads and beards in mourning. The clipping of the beard in <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a> underscores the totality of Moab's impending humiliation.<p><b>on every hand is a gash</b><br>The act of making gashes or cuts on the body was a pagan mourning practice, forbidden to the Israelites in <a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>. It was a way to express extreme grief and was often associated with idolatrous rituals. The presence of gashes on every hand in Moab indicates the depth of their despair and their reliance on pagan customs in times of distress. This highlights the contrast between the practices of the surrounding nations and the commands given to Israel.<p><b>and around every waist is sackcloth</b><br>Wearing sackcloth was a traditional sign of mourning and repentance in the ancient world. Sackcloth was a coarse material, uncomfortable to wear, symbolizing the wearer's affliction and humility. This practice is frequently mentioned in the Bible, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>, where the people of Nineveh don sackcloth in response to Jonah's warning. In <a href="/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>, the widespread wearing of sackcloth by the Moabites signifies their collective mourning and the severity of the judgment they face.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
