Jeremiah, as a prophet, receives direct communication from God, highlighting the authority and importance of the message. This is a common introduction in prophetic literature, underscoring the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>).<p><b>Go and stand at the gate of the people:</b><br>The "gate of the people" likely refers to a main entrance of Jerusalem, a place of significant public activity and commerce. Gates were central to city life in ancient Israel, serving as places for legal matters, public announcements, and social gatherings (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). This setting underscores the public nature of Jeremiah's message.<p><b>through which the kings of Judah go in and out;</b><br>This phrase indicates the gate's importance, as it is used by the kings of Judah. It suggests a location of political and royal significance, possibly the Benjamin Gate or the Sheep Gate. The mention of kings highlights the message's relevance to national leadership and governance, reminding readers of the covenant responsibilities of Judah's rulers (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>).<p><b>and stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem.</b><br>Jeremiah is instructed to deliver his message at multiple gates, symbolizing the comprehensive nature of God's warning to all inhabitants of Jerusalem. The gates represent different sectors of society, emphasizing that the message is for everyone, from leaders to common citizens. This reflects the inclusive nature of God's call to repentance and the widespread impact of the impending judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/33-30.htm">Ezekiel 33:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Similar prophetic introductions appear in <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4</a>, underscoring that the prophet&#8217;s words carry divine authority.<p>&#8226; Because the command comes from the covenant-keeping LORD (Yahweh), the people are accountable to listen (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that Scripture is God-breathed (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) and therefore trustworthy and binding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go and stand</b><p>&#8220;Go and stand&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Action verbs&#8212;&#8220;go,&#8221; &#8220;stand&#8221;&#8212;call for immediate, visible obedience (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing signals boldness and perseverance; Jeremiah must plant himself where God places him, regardless of opposition (<a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17-19</a>; <a href="/acts/5-20.htm">Acts 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This posture foreshadows the New Testament charge to &#8220;stand firm in the faith&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the gate of the people</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;at the gate of the people&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; City gates served as courts, markets, and meeting places (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>; <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). By positioning Jeremiah there, God ensures maximum exposure.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;people&#8217;s gate&#8221; implies accessibility; everyone passing through will hear the warning, fulfilling God&#8217;s desire that none perish without knowledge (<a href="/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Public proclamation keeps the message from being hidden or elitist (<a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through which the kings of Judah go in and out</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;through which the kings of Judah go in and out&#8230;&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The royal gate highlights accountability for national leaders (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7-9</a>; <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Kings set the moral tone; God addresses them first so the rest of Judah might follow (<a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm">Jeremiah 22:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; By confronting rulers at their own entrance, the Lord demonstrates that no earthly authority outranks His word (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem.&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The repetition&#8212;&#8220;stand &#8230; stand&#8221;&#8212;emphasizes persistence. The message must saturate every point of entry, signaling comprehensive judgment or blessing depending on response (<a href="/jeremiah/17-24.htm">Jeremiah 17:24-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Multiple gates mean multiple audiences: merchants, pilgrims, families. God&#8217;s word is for every socioeconomic bracket (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The entire city is under covenant obligations; selective obedience will not suffice (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Jeremiah 17:19</a> shows God commissioning His prophet to deliver an unfiltered, public warning at Jerusalem&#8217;s strategic gateways. The LORD&#8217;s direct command underscores Scriptural authority. Jeremiah&#8217;s standing posture models steadfast obedience and courage. By targeting both the royal gate and every other gate, God makes clear that leaders and commoners alike are accountable to His covenant. The verse challenges believers today to proclaim God&#8217;s truth openly, respect its authority, and recognize that His Word speaks to every sphere of life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Thus said the Lord unto me . . .</span>--We enter here on an entirely fresh series of messages, arranged probably in chronological order, but having no immediate connection with what precedes, and narrated with a much fuller account of the circumstances connected with them. This, which begins the series, would appear from <a href="/jeremiah/17-25.htm" title="Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.">Jeremiah 17:25</a> to have been delivered before the sins of the people had assumed the hopeless, irremediable character which is implied in the two previous chapters; and the first part of this may probably be referred therefore to the early years of the reign of Jehoiakim. In its circumstances and mode of delivery it is parallel with the discourse of <a href="/context/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1-5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The gate</span> <span class= "bld">of the children of the people . . .</span><span class= "ital">--</span>No gate so described is mentioned in the great topographical record of Nehemiah 3 or elsewhere, and we are therefore left to conjecture where it was. The context shows that it was a place of concourse, a gate of the Temple rather than of the city, perhaps the special gate by which the kings and people of Judah entered into the enclosure of the Temple. The name may indicate, as in <a href="/jeremiah/26-23.htm" title="And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.">Jeremiah 26:23</a>, that it was that "of the common people," or "laity," as in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-5.htm" title="And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brothers the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.">2Chronicles 35:5</a>, as dis tinguished from that used by the priests and Levites; and it would appear, from the nature of the warning proclaimed there, to have been the scene of some open desecration of the Sabbath--possibly of the sale of sheep or doves for sacrifice, like that of <a href="/john/2-14.htm" title="And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:">John 2:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a>, or of the more common articles of the market, as in <a href="/nehemiah/13-15.htm" title="In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.">Nehemiah 13:15</a>. By some writers it has been identified with the "gate of Benjamin" (<a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm" title="Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm" title="Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), but this would seem to have been more conspicuous as a place of judgment than of trade; nor is there any reason why it should be described by a different name here. Some, indeed. have conjectured that we should read "gate of <span class= "ital">Benjamin </span>"instead of "gate of <span class= "ital">Beni-am," </span>which gives the meaning "children of the people." It is noticeable that the message was to be delivered at the other gates as well, as being a protest against a prevalent sin. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-27.</span> - An exhortation to a more strict observance of the Sabbath. The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in <a href="/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see <a href="/nehemiah/13.htm">Nehemiah 13</a>.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. "Sabbath" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate of the children of the people</span>. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the kings of Judah come in</span>. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase "kings of Judah" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/17-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
