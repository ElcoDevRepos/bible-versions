This title underscores His power and the seriousness of the message being delivered. It is a reminder of God's ultimate control over the events of history and His ability to execute judgment.<p><b>Cut down the trees and raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem:</b><br>The instruction to cut down trees and build a siege ramp reflects ancient military tactics used during sieges. Trees would be used to construct ramps or battering rams to breach city walls. This imagery indicates the impending destruction and the seriousness of the threat against Jerusalem. Historically, the Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, used such tactics during their siege of Jerusalem, which culminated in the city's fall in 586 BC.<p><b>This city must be punished:</b><br>The necessity of punishment highlights the justice of God. Jerusalem, the city chosen by God, had turned away from His commandments, necessitating divine retribution. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings were contingent upon obedience, and disobedience led to curses, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>There is nothing but oppression in her midst:</b><br>The mention of oppression points to the social injustices prevalent in Jerusalem at the time. The leaders and people had abandoned God's laws, leading to corruption and exploitation. This echoes the prophetic themes found throughout the book of Jeremiah, where the prophet calls out the moral and spiritual decay of the nation. It also connects to other prophetic writings, such as those of Isaiah and Amos, who similarly condemned social injustice and called for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

Hewing down trees was an ordinary feature of Assyrian and Babylonian expeditions. Thus, Assurnacirpal "caused the forests of all (his enemies) to fall" ('Records of the Past,' 3:40, 77), and Shalmaneser calls himself "the trampler on the heads of mountains and all forests "(Ibid. p. 83; comp. p. 90). The timber was partly required for their palaces and fleets, but also, as the context here suggests, for warlike operations. "Trees," as Professor Rawlinson remarks, "were sometimes cut down and built into the mound" (see next note); they would also be used for the "bulwarks" or siege instruments spoken of in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cast a mount</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pour a mount</span> (or "bank," as it is elsewhere rendered), with reference to the emptying of the baskets of earth required for building up the "mount" (mound).
