Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River, was famous for producing this balm. The rhetorical question highlights the availability of healing resources, both physically and spiritually. In a broader biblical context, the balm symbolizes God's provision and the potential for spiritual healing. The mention of Gilead connects to <a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>, where traders carried balm, indicating its value and significance. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate healing found in Jesus Christ, often referred to as the Great Physician.<p><b>Is no physician there?</b><br>The question implies the presence of healers or those capable of administering the balm. In ancient times, physicians were expected to provide remedies for physical ailments, paralleling spiritual leaders' roles in addressing spiritual maladies. The absence of effective healing suggests a deeper issue beyond physical remedies, pointing to a spiritual crisis. This phrase can be connected to Jesus' role as the ultimate healer, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/9-12.htm">Matthew 9:12</a>, where He states that the sick need a physician, emphasizing His mission to heal the spiritually broken.<p><b>Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?</b><br>The "daughter of my people" refers to the nation of Israel, often personified as a daughter in prophetic literature. The lack of restoration indicates a failure to repent and turn back to God, despite the availability of healing. This phrase underscores the theme of spiritual stubbornness and the consequences of ignoring God's call to repentance. It echoes the lament found in <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>, where superficial healing is criticized. The question challenges the people to recognize their spiritual condition and seek genuine restoration through repentance and faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The question assumes the balm is plentiful and effective.<p>&#8226; The Lord is really asking, &#8220;Has My remedy suddenly disappeared?&#8221; His covenant people still had access to Him, the true source of healing (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the balm points to God&#8217;s own provision for sin-sick hearts. He offers grace that is as real as that resin&#8212;yet Judah keeps reaching for counterfeit cures (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; In Christ the ultimate balm appears. Centuries later He will announce, &#8220;He has sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>; fulfilled in <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is no physician there?</b><p>&#8226; Ancient Israel relied on trained healers, yet the Lord Himself was always the nation&#8217;s chief Physician (<a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a>; 17:14).<p>&#8226; By asking this second question, God spotlights failed leadership: priests and prophets who &#8220;dress the wound of My people with very little care&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226; A genuine doctor diagnoses honestly and applies the right remedy. Judah&#8217;s spiritual leaders deny the seriousness of sin, so the infection spreads (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; For us the verse reminds that only Jesus, &#8220;the great Physician,&#8221; can deal with sin at its root (<a href="/mark/2-17.htm">Mark 2:17</a>). No amount of self-help or religious ritual can substitute for His saving work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?</b><p>&#8226; Since both balm and physician are available, the lingering sickness can only be blamed on stubborn refusal to receive treatment. Judah prefers idols to repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/8-5.htm">Jeremiah 8:5</a>; 9:13-14).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;daughter of my people&#8221; reveals God&#8217;s tender heart. He is not a distant clinician; He aches over their self-inflicted wounds (<a href="/jeremiah/8-21.htm">Jeremiah 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The continued illness signals impending judgment&#8212;yet even here God hints at future hope: &#8220;But I will restore health to you and heal your wounds&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-17.htm">Jeremiah 30:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal application: whenever Christ&#8217;s cure is rejected, spiritual decay follows. When He is embraced, restoration is guaranteed (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a> pictures a loving God holding out genuine healing&#8212;both the balm (His provided remedy) and the physician (Himself). Judah&#8217;s tragedy is not the absence of a cure but the refusal to take it. The verse calls every reader to admit the depth of sin, trust the divine Physician, and experience the full restoration He still promises in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Is there no balm in Gilead . . .?</span>--The resinous gums of Gilead, identified by some naturalists with those of the terebinth, by others with mastich, the gum of the <span class= "ital">Pistaccia lentiscus, </span>were prominent in the pharmacop?ia of Israel, and were exported to Egypt for the embalmment of the dead (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm" title="And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm" title="Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-8.htm" title="Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.">Jeremiah 51:8</a>). A plaister of such gums was the received prescription for healing a wound. The question of the prophet is therefore a parable. "Are there no means of healing, no healer to apply them, for the spiritual wounds of Israel? The prophets were her physicians, repentance and righteousness were her balm of Gilead. <span class= "ital">Why has no balsam-plaister been laid on the daughter of my people? </span>Why so little result from the means which Jehovah has provided?" The imagery re-appears in <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm" title="Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shall you use many medicines; for you shall not be cured.">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-8.htm" title="Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.">Jeremiah 51:8</a>. The balm which was grown at Jericho under the Roman Empire (Tac, <span class= "ital">Hist. v.</span> 6; Plin., <span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. xii.</span> 25), and was traditionally reported to have been brought by the Queen of Sheba, was probably <span class= "ital">the Amyris Opobalsamum, </span>now cultivated at Mecca, which requires a more tropical climate than that of Gilead. Wyclif's version, "Is there no <span class= "ital">triacle </span>in Gilead?" may be noted as illustrating the history of a word now obsolete. "Triacle" was the English form of <span class= "ital">theriacum, </span>the mediaeval panacea for all wounds, and specially for the bites of serpents and venomous beasts. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - No hope or remedy is left; again a proverbial expression. <span class="cmt_word">No balm in Gilead</span>. Gilead appears to have been celebrated in early times for its balsam, which was expected by Ishmaelites to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>) and by Jewish merchants to Tyro (<a href="/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). It was one of the most costly products of Palestine (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>), and was prized for its medicinal properties in cases of wounds (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>). Josephus mentions this balsam several times, but states that it only grew at Jericho ('Antiq.,' 15:4,2), Tristram searched for balsam in its ancient haunts, but in vain; he thinks Jeremiah means the <span class="accented">Balsamodendron gileadense</span> or <span class="accented">opobalsamum</span>, which in Arabia is used as a medicine both internally and externally. But if Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 24:22) may be followed in his wide use of the term "balsam" so as to include the exudations of the "lentisens" or mastick tree, then "balm of Gilead" is still to be found; for the mastick tree "grows commonly all over the country, excepting in the plains and the Jordan valley" ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 336). <span class="cmt_word">Is there no physician there?</span> We hear but little of physicians in the Old Testament. They are only mentioned again in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> (but with reference to Egypt, where medicine was much cultivated), and in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>. From the two latter passages we may, perhaps, infer that physicians were rarely successful; and this is certainly the impression produced by Ecclus. 38:15, "He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician." The remedies employed in the Talmudic period quite bear out this strong saying (see Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraical,' on <a href="/mark/5-26.htm">Mark 5:26</a>). The physicians of Gilead, however, probably confined themselves to their one famous simple, the balsam. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the health... recovered</span>?
