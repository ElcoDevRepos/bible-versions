Here, he delivers a specific message to Seraiah, who is identified as a quartermaster. The role of a quartermaster involved logistical responsibilities, suggesting Seraiah's importance in the royal administration. Seraiah is also the brother of Baruch, Jeremiah's scribe, indicating a family closely connected to Jeremiah's prophetic ministry. This connection highlights the trust and responsibility placed on Seraiah to carry out Jeremiah's instructions.<p><b>when he went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah</b><br>This journey to Babylon is significant as it occurs during a tumultuous period in Judah's history. King Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. His reign was marked by political instability and rebellion against Babylonian rule. The trip to Babylon likely involved diplomatic or tribute purposes, reflecting the vassal relationship between Judah and Babylon. This context underscores the gravity of Jeremiah's message, as it is delivered amidst impending judgment and exile.<p><b>in the fourth year of Zedekiah&#8217;s reign</b><br>The fourth year of Zedekiah's reign corresponds to approximately 594/593 BC. This period is crucial as it precedes the final siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. During this time, Jeremiah's prophecies warned of Babylon's dominance and the consequences of Judah's disobedience.

The mention of both father and grandfather leaves no doubt that Seraiah was the brother of Jeremiah's friend and secretary, Baruch (<a href="/jeremiah/32-13.htm" title="And I charged Baruch before them, saying,">Jeremiah 32:13</a>). It was, therefore, natural that the prophet should select him as the depository of the great prediction. The term "quiet prince," which the Authorised version adopts from Luther, means really <span class= "ital">prince of the resting-place, </span>and describes an office like that of our quartermaster-general. He would seem to have been attendant on Zedekiah, probably appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to regulate the details of the journey to Babylon, and arrange the resting-places at its several stages. The versions seem to have been perplexed by the unusual title, the LXX. giving "ruler of the gifts," and the Vulgate "prince of prophecy." The prediction would seem to have been of the nature of a parting gift to him.<p><span class= "bld">In the fourth year of his reign.</span>--The date is significant as giving a missing link in the history. The beginning of Zedekiah's reign was memorable for the gathering at Jerusalem of ambassadors from the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Zidon, obviously for the purpose of forming a confederacy against Nebuchadnezzar, and Jeremiah had condemned all such schemes as contrary to the will of Jehovah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/27-1.htm" title="In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,">Jeremiah 27:1-13</a>). It is probable that Nebuchadnezzar summoned the king of Judah to Babylon to question him as to this scheme, and to demand an act of renewed homage. On this journey he was accompanied by the brother of the prophet's friend and fellow-worker, and Jeremiah takes the opportunity of committing to his charge what we may call an esoteric prophecy, lifting up the veil of the future. He counselled submission for the present, because resistance was premature, and would prove futile. He looked forward to the time when the law of retribution would be fulfilled in Babylon as it had been fulfilled in Jerusalem. The whole proceeding was in perfect harmony with the prediction of <a href="/jeremiah/27-7.htm" title="And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.">Jeremiah 27:7</a>, that all nations should serve Nebuchadnezzar and his son and his son's son till the "very time of his land" should come. It lies in the nature of the case that a duplicate copy was kept by Baruch or Jeremiah, of which the present text of Jeremiah 50, 51 is a transcript.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59-64.</span> - <span class="accented">Epilogue</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The word,</span> etc. (see ver. 61). <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah</span>.
