In the prophetic tradition, such declarations underscore the seriousness and certainty of the message. The phrase is common in prophetic literature, indicating that the following words are not merely human opinion but a divine decree.<p><b>concerning the sons and daughters born in this place</b><br>The reference to "sons and daughters" highlights the generational impact of the prophecy. In the context of Jeremiah, "this place" refers to Judah, specifically Jerusalem, which was facing impending judgment due to persistent idolatry and disobedience. The mention of children underscores the totality of the coming judgment, affecting even the most innocent and vulnerable.<p><b>and the mothers who bore them</b><br>Mothers are often seen as symbols of nurturing and life-giving. In ancient Israelite culture, motherhood was highly valued, and children were considered a blessing from God. This phrase indicates that the judgment will disrupt the natural order and blessings of family life, a theme consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>and the fathers who fathered them in this land</b><br>Fathers were the heads of households and responsible for the spiritual and physical well-being of their families. The phrase "in this land" emphasizes the connection to the Promised Land, which was given to the Israelites as part of God's covenant with Abraham. The impending judgment signifies a breach of this covenant due to the people's unfaithfulness, echoing the warnings of exile found in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often concerning judgment and restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_and_daughters.htm">Sons and Daughters</a></b><br>The children born in the land of Judah, representing future generations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mothers_and_fathers.htm">Mothers and Fathers</a></b><br>The parents in Judah, symbolizing the current generation responsible for the upbringing of their children.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land (Judah)</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is facing impending judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The passage highlights the severe consequences of sin, not just for individuals but for entire families and future generations.

Birth within the covenant land never guaranteed immunity from judgment if the covenant was despised (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier prophets had warned the same soil would yield &#8220;thorns and thistles&#8221; of judgment if Israel persisted in idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the mothers who bore them</b><p>&#8226; Mothers are highlighted to show the heartbreak awaiting families; even the natural protectors will be unable to shield their children (<a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Maternal grief echoes the sorrow Rachel experienced, &#8220;weeping for her children&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), a sorrow revived during later catastrophes.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that sin&#8217;s fallout fractures the tenderest bonds of life, just as prophesied in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56-57</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the fathers who fathered them in this land</b><p>&#8226; Fathers, responsible to teach God&#8217;s law (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>), are included because they failed in spiritual leadership, permitting idolatry to flourish (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Patriarchal headship could not shield the family when those heads rejected the LORD&#8217;s headship (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;in this land&#8221; repeats the setting, reinforcing that covenant privileges can turn into covenant penalties when God&#8217;s long-suffering is ignored (<a href="/jeremiah/11-3.htm">Jeremiah 11:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Jeremiah 16:3</a> introduces a severe oracle: the LORD Himself solemnly addresses every layer of the family&#8212;children, mothers, fathers&#8212;rooted in the very land once promised for blessing. By naming each group, God underscores that the coming judgment is comprehensive and deserved, cutting across generational lines because of persistent national rebellion. The verse serves as a sober reminder that proximity to holy things offers no refuge when hearts remain unrepentant; only obedience secures blessing, while disobedience invites the righteous discipline of the covenant-keeping God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;
