The mention of plague, sword, and famine reflects the severe judgments that had already begun to afflict Jerusalem, fulfilling earlier prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). The survival of some through these calamities only to face further judgment underscores the totality of God's decree.<p><b>to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives.</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar was the powerful ruler of Babylon, known for his military conquests and the eventual destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This handing over signifies God's use of foreign powers as instruments of judgment, a common theme in the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). The enemies seeking their lives highlight the dire situation for Judah, surrounded by hostile forces.<p><b>He will put them to the sword;</b><br>This phrase indicates the violent and decisive nature of the judgment. The sword is a frequent biblical symbol of war and divine retribution (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). It reflects the fulfillment of God's warnings through Jeremiah that resistance against Babylon would lead to destruction.<p><b>he will not spare them or show pity or compassion.&#8217;</b><br>The absence of pity or compassion underscores the severity of the judgment and the finality of God's decision. This reflects the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for disobedience. It also contrasts with God's usual character of mercy, highlighting the extent of Judah's rebellion and the necessity of justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian siege.
