This plea for his persecutors to be put to shame reflects a common theme in the Psalms and prophetic literature, where the righteous seek vindication from God against their enemies (<a href="/psalms/35-4.htm">Psalm 35:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/71-13.htm">Psalm 71:13</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, shame was a powerful social force, often associated with public disgrace and loss of honor. Jeremiah's request aligns with the covenantal promises where God defends His faithful servants.<p><b>but do not let me be put to shame</b><br>Jeremiah contrasts his desire for his enemies' shame with his plea for personal vindication. This reflects a deep trust in God's justice and protection. The prophet's role was divinely appointed, and his message was often unpopular, leading to personal risk. His plea echoes the assurance found in <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a>, where the servant of the Lord is confident that God will not allow him to be disgraced. This confidence is rooted in a covenant relationship with God, who is faithful to His promises.<p><b>Let them be terrified</b><br>The call for his enemies to be terrified is a request for divine intervention. In biblical terms, terror often accompanies God's judgment (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>). Jeremiah's adversaries were not just personal enemies but opponents of God's message. The terror he seeks is not merely fear but a recognition of God's power and authority, leading to repentance or judgment.<p><b>but do not let me be terrified</b><br>Jeremiah seeks courage and peace amidst his trials, a common theme for those called to prophetic ministry. The assurance of God's presence and protection is a recurring promise in Scripture (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Jeremiah's request highlights the human need for divine strength when facing overwhelming opposition, trusting that God will sustain him.<p><b>Bring upon them the day of disaster</b><br>The "day of disaster" refers to a time of divine judgment. In the prophetic literature, such days are often associated with the "Day of the Lord," a time when God enacts justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>). Jeremiah's call for this day reflects his role as a prophet who announces God's impending judgment on Judah for their covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>and shatter them with double destruction</b><br>The phrase "double destruction" emphasizes the severity of the judgment. In biblical terms, "double" can signify completeness or fullness (<a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>). This reflects the principle of retributive justice, where the punishment fits the crime. Jeremiah's call for such judgment underscores the seriousness of the people's rebellion against God and the inevitable consequences of their actions. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Christ, who bore the full weight of sin's penalty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecutors.htm">Persecutors</a></b><br>Those who oppose and seek to harm Jeremiah, representing the broader opposition to God's message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, to whom Jeremiah is prophesying, warning them of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_disaster.htm">Day of Disaster</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to the coming judgment upon those who oppose God's will and His messenger.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/double_destruction.htm">Double Destruction</a></b><br>A term indicating the severity of the judgment that Jeremiah calls upon his enemies, emphasizing complete and thorough retribution.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Jeremiah's plea reflects a deep trust in God's ability to bring about justice.

Just as those who mocked Noah were silenced by the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17&#8211;24</a>), Jeremiah trusts the Lord to silence his adversaries.<p>&#8226; The plea is not for personal revenge but for the vindication of God&#8217;s message, paralleling Paul&#8217;s assurance that &#8220;whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but do not let me be put to shame</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but do not let me be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Jeremiah stands on God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, echoing David&#8217;s cry, &#8220;In You, LORD, I take refuge; let me never be put to shame&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-1.htm">Psalm 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Shame would discredit both the prophet and the Word he proclaims; therefore, protection of Jeremiah&#8217;s reputation safeguards the integrity of God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between persecutors and prophet highlights the principle that God honors those who honor Him (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let them be terrified</b><p>&#8220;Let them be terrified&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Holy dread falls on those who resist God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>). Jeremiah asks that his enemies experience such fear, awakening them to the reality of divine authority.<p>&#8226; Terror here is judgment&#8217;s advance warning, similar to the panic that struck the Philistines when the ark arrived in their camp (<a href="/1_samuel/4-7.htm">1 Samuel 4:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The request is consistent with God&#8217;s promise to &#8220;send My terror ahead of you&#8221; against stubborn opposition (<a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but do not let me be terrified</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;but do not let me be terrified&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Jeremiah differentiates himself from the wicked by anchoring his heart in the Lord&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already assured him, &#8220;Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>), an echo of <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<p>&#8226; Courage is not self-generated; it flows from trusting the One who is &#8220;my refuge in the day of disaster&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-17.htm">Jeremiah 17:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bring upon them the day of disaster</b><p>&#8220;Bring upon them the day of disaster&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Day of disaster&#8221; refers to a decisive moment when God&#8217;s judgment falls (<a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14&#8211;15</a>). Judah&#8217;s leaders would soon face Babylon&#8217;s siege exactly as foretold (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This request aligns with God&#8217;s announced timetable rather than personal impatience. Jeremiah merely agrees with the prophetic word already given (<a href="/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar language is used when Amos calls for justice to &#8220;roll on like a river&#8221; (<a href="/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), indicating a longing for God&#8217;s righteousness to prevail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and shatter them with double destruction</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and shatter them with double destruction&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-18.htm">Jeremiah 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Double&#8221; points to complete, unequivocal judgment, matching their compounded guilt (<a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned that unrepentant sin invites proportional retribution (<a href="/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The image of shattering evokes a potter smashing flawed clay (<a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>), emphasizing the finality of divine discipline when mercy is spurned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s six-fold plea balances a call for righteous judgment with personal reliance on God&#8217;s protection.
