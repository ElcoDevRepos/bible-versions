It is, perhaps, not without significance in connection with this passage, that when the city was restored, the region above the "horse-gate" was repaired by the priests, who seem to have had their houses in that quarter (<a href="/context/nehemiah/3-28.htm" title="From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house.">Nehemiah 3:28-29</a>). They appear to have been anxious to restore the sanctity of that over which Jeremiah had lamented as desecrated and defiled. The word for "ashes" was a technical one (<a href="/context/leviticus/6-10.htm" title="And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire has consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.">Leviticus 6:10-11</a>) for the refuse which remained on the altar after a burnt-offering, and which was to be carried without the camp (<a href="/leviticus/4-12.htm" title="Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.">Leviticus 4:12</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-11.htm" title="And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp to a clean place.">Leviticus 6:11</a>).
