In biblical literature, nations are often depicted as women, and "daughter" can imply vulnerability or a need for protection. Egypt, historically a powerful empire, is here predicted to experience humiliation and defeat. This prophecy aligns with the historical context of Egypt's decline during the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC, particularly after the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, where the Babylonians defeated the Egyptians. The shame mentioned is a reversal of Egypt's former glory and pride, often seen in its interactions with Israel (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>).<p><b>she will be delivered into the hands of the people of the north.</b><br>The "people of the north" refers to the Babylonians, who were situated to the north of Egypt and were rising as a dominant power under King Nebuchadnezzar. This phrase indicates a transfer of power and control, as Egypt would fall under Babylonian influence and domination. The prophecy is consistent with the geopolitical shifts of the time, as Babylon expanded its empire. This also connects to other prophecies in Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a>) where the north is often associated with impending judgment and invasion. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to use one nation to execute judgment on another, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_egypt.htm">Daughter of Egypt</a></b><br>This term is a metaphorical expression referring to the nation of Egypt.

Similar language is used of Zion in <a href="/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>, reminding us that nations stand before the Lord as dependents, not equals.<p>&#8226; Historically, Jeremiah is addressing Egypt under Pharaoh Hophra (<a href="/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>). The prophecy speaks to a literal people, in a literal place, at a set moment in God&#8217;s timetable.<p>&#8226; Egypt&#8217;s long-trusted military strength (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>) and economic prowess (<a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a>) could not shield her from divine scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be put to shame</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;will be put to shame;&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-24.htm">Jeremiah 46:24</a>)<p>&#8226; Shame in Scripture is the public exposure of false confidence (<a href="/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>). Egypt boasted in chariots and river commerce, but the Lord would turn that pride into humiliation (<a href="/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already warned through Moses that the idols of Egypt would tremble before Him (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>).
