It reflects the biblical theme that God is all-knowing, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where David speaks of God's complete understanding of his thoughts and actions. Jeremiah's appeal to God's understanding underscores his trust in God's ability to discern the truth of his circumstances and intentions.<p><b>remember me and attend to me.</b><br>Jeremiah is asking God to be mindful of him and to take action on his behalf. This plea for remembrance is reminiscent of other biblical figures, such as Hannah in <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>, who asked God to remember her in her distress. The request for God to "attend" suggests a desire for divine intervention and care, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God promises to be attentive to their needs.<p><b>Avenge me against my persecutors.</b><br>Jeremiah seeks justice against those who oppose him, a common theme in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/35.htm">Psalm 35:1-3</a>, where David asks God to contend with those who contend with him. This reflects the biblical principle that vengeance belongs to the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>), and believers are encouraged to trust God to right wrongs rather than seeking personal revenge.<p><b>In Your patience, do not take me away.</b><br>Jeremiah appeals to God's patience, asking that his life not be cut short amidst his trials. This reflects the biblical understanding of God's longsuffering nature, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish. Jeremiah's plea indicates his desire to continue fulfilling his prophetic mission despite the challenges he faces.<p><b>Know that I endure reproach for Your honor.</b><br>Jeremiah's endurance of reproach is a testament to his commitment to God's calling. This mirrors the experiences of other prophets and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who endured suffering and shame for the sake of God's glory (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). Jeremiah's willingness to bear reproach highlights the cost of discipleship and the call to remain faithful amidst opposition, as echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11-12</a>, where Jesus speaks of the blessedness of those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whom Jeremiah is addressing in his plea for remembrance and justice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecutors.htm">Persecutors</a></b><br>Those who oppose and threaten Jeremiah, likely including both individuals and groups who reject his prophetic message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reproach.htm">Reproach</a></b><br>The scorn and disgrace Jeremiah faces as a result of his commitment to delivering God's messages.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jeremiah's ministry takes place, facing impending judgment due to its unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_understanding_and_remembrance.htm">God's Understanding and Remembrance</a></b><br>God is intimately aware of our struggles and remembers us in our trials. We can confidently bring our pleas before Him, knowing He understands our circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/patience_in_suffering.htm">Patience in Suffering</a></b><br>Jeremiah's request for God not to take him away in His patience teaches us to trust in God's timing and sovereignty, even when we face prolonged difficulties.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/enduring_reproach_for_god's_honor.htm">Enduring Reproach for God's Honor</a></b><br>Like Jeremiah, we may face scorn for our faithfulness to God.

Habakkuk voiced a similar tension: &#8220;LORD, are You not from everlasting? &#8230; We will not die&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s restraint postpones judgment, but Jeremiah longs to survive to see vindication (<a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors Paul&#8217;s desire to remain fruitful amid hardship (<a href="/philippians/1-22.htm">Philippians 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Know that I endure reproach for Your honor</b><p>Jeremiah reminds God that the insults he bears are directed at God Himself, much like David&#8217;s cry: &#8220;Zeal for Your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>; cf. <a href="/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s suffering validates his loyalty (<a href="/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; New-Testament believers share this pattern: &#8220;If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-14.htm">1 Peter 4:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a> is a heartfelt appeal rooted in covenant confidence.
