In the ancient Near East, valleys were often seen as symbols of prosperity and security due to their ability to sustain crops and livestock. The rhetorical question challenges the misplaced confidence in material wealth and natural resources, which are ultimately transient and unreliable.<p><b>your valleys so fruitful,</b><br>The emphasis on the fruitfulness of the valleys highlights the abundance and prosperity that the Ammonites enjoyed. This fruitfulness could lead to a false sense of security and self-sufficiency, which is a common theme in the prophetic literature. The Bible often warns against relying on earthly wealth and resources instead of God (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p><b>O faithless daughter?</b><br>The term "faithless daughter" is a metaphor for the nation of Ammon, portraying it as unfaithful or disloyal. In biblical language, nations are often personified as women, and faithlessness implies a breach of covenant or moral failure. This phrase underscores the spiritual adultery of the Ammonites, who have turned away from God.<p><b>You trust in your riches</b><br>Trusting in riches is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with pride and a false sense of security. The Ammonites' reliance on their wealth is condemned because it reflects a lack of trust in God. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against storing up treasures on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>and say, &#8216;Who can come against me?&#8217;</b><br>This statement reflects arrogance and overconfidence, a common attitude among nations that feel secure in their wealth and military strength. The rhetorical question implies invincibility, yet the Bible consistently teaches that no nation is beyond God's reach or judgment. This echoes the pride of other nations like Babylon and Assyria, which were eventually humbled by God (<a href="/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel. <a href="/jeremiah/49-4.htm">Jeremiah 49:4</a> is part of a prophecy against them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/valleys.htm">Valleys</a></b><br>Symbolic of the fertile and prosperous regions that the Ammonites boasted about, representing their false sense of security.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/faithless_daughter.htm">Faithless Daughter</a></b><br>A metaphor for the Ammonites, indicating their unfaithfulness and misplaced trust in material wealth and geographical advantages.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasures.htm">Treasures</a></b><br>Refers to the wealth and resources that the Ammonites relied upon instead of trusting in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/false_security_in_material_wealth.htm">False Security in Material Wealth</a></b><br>The Ammonites' trust in their treasures and fertile valleys serves as a warning against placing our security in material possessions.
