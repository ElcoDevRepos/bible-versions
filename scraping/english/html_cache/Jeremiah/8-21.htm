The "daughter of my people" is a poetic expression often used in the Old Testament to denote the nation of Israel or Judah, emphasizing a familial and intimate relationship. The "brokenness" refers to the spiritual and moral decay of the people, as well as the impending physical destruction due to their disobedience to God. This brokenness is a result of their idolatry and rejection of God's covenant, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah. The prophet's lament echoes the heart of God, who desires repentance and restoration for His people.<p><b>I am crushed</b><br>Jeremiah's personal anguish is evident here, as he identifies with the suffering of his people. The word "crushed" conveys a sense of overwhelming grief and despair. This emotional response is not just a personal feeling but also reflects the heart of God, who is deeply affected by the sin and suffering of His people. Jeremiah's role as a prophet involves bearing the burden of the people's sins and interceding on their behalf, much like Moses did for the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate intercessor, Jesus Christ, who was "crushed for our iniquities" (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><b>I mourn</b><br>The act of mourning in ancient Israel often involved wearing sackcloth, ashes, and public lamentation. Jeremiah's mourning is both a personal expression of grief and a prophetic act, symbolizing the appropriate response to sin and impending judgment. Mourning is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, calling the people to repentance. In the New Testament, Jesus also mourns over Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37-39</a>), showing continuity in God's desire for His people to turn back to Him.<p><b>horror has gripped me</b><br>The "horror" that grips Jeremiah is a reaction to the realization of the severity of Judah's situation. This horror is not just fear of the coming Babylonian invasion but also a profound understanding of the spiritual desolation that has led to this point. The gripping nature of this horror suggests an inescapable and overwhelming dread. This phrase can be connected to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), highlighting the seriousness of turning away from God. The horror also prefigures the anguish of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He faced the weight of humanity's sin (<a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing deep sorrow and empathy for the people of Judah.

This foreshadows Christ, who &#8220;was moved with compassion&#8221; over Israel&#8217;s lost state (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p>&#8226;
