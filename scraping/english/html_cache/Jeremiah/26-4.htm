Jeremiah is instructed to deliver God's message directly, underscoring the divine authority behind his words. Prophets in the Old Testament often began their messages with a declaration of divine origin, reinforcing that the message was not their own but from God. This reflects the biblical theme of God communicating His will through chosen individuals, as seen with other prophets like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>&#8216;If you do not listen to Me</b><br>Listening to God implies obedience and heeding His commands. In the Hebrew context, "listening" often means more than just hearing; it involves active response and compliance. The Israelites were repeatedly called to listen to God throughout their history, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, the Shema, which is a central declaration of faith. The failure to listen is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to consequences such as exile.<p><b>and walk in My law,</b><br>Walking in God's law refers to living according to His commandments and statutes. The "law" here is the Torah, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil laws given to Israel. Walking is a metaphor for one's conduct and lifestyle, indicating a continuous and habitual action. <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-2</a> contrasts the blessed man who delights in the law of the Lord with those who do not. This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to the law was a condition of blessing.<p><b>which I have set before you,</b><br>This phrase underscores God's initiative in revealing His law to His people. The law was given to Israel at Mount Sinai and was meant to guide them in righteousness and justice. The phrase "set before you" suggests that the law is accessible and clear, leaving the people without excuse. It also implies a choice, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where God sets before the people life and death, blessing and curse, urging them to choose life by loving and obeying Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often facing opposition and persecution for his prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and warnings through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often warned by God through prophets like Jeremiah due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem, where Jeremiah delivered many of his prophecies, including the one in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law (Torah)</a></b><br>The divine instructions given by God to the Israelites, which they were commanded to follow as part of their covenant relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening_to_god.htm">The Importance of Listening to God</a></b><br>God&#8217;s message through Jeremiah emphasizes the necessity of listening to His voice.

Understanding this helps us to remain vigilant in our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_scripture.htm">The Role of Prophets and Scripture</a></b><br>Prophets like Jeremiah were God's mouthpieces, and today, Scripture serves as our prophetic guide.
