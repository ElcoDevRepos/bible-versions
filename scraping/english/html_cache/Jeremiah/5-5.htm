Jeremiah, as a prophet, is seeking those who should have a deeper understanding of God's laws and expectations. Historically, leaders were expected to guide the people in righteousness and justice. This phrase highlights Jeremiah's hope that those in authority would be more receptive to God's message. The role of leaders in Israel was crucial, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, where kings were instructed to read and follow God's law.<p><b>Surely they know the way of the LORD, the justice of their God.</b><br>This phrase reflects an assumption that those in positions of power would have a greater knowledge of God's ways and His justice. "The way of the LORD" refers to living according to God's commandments and principles, which are rooted in justice, mercy, and humility (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The leaders were expected to embody and enforce these principles. The expectation was that their knowledge would lead to righteous governance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>, where the righteousness of leaders brings joy to the people.<p><b>But they too, with one accord, had broken the yoke and torn off the chains.</b><br>This imagery of breaking the yoke and tearing off chains symbolizes rebellion and rejection of God's authority. The yoke often represents submission and service, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, where God speaks of breaking the yoke of slavery. Here, it indicates that the leaders, like the common people, have rejected God's covenant and guidance. This rebellion is a recurring theme in Jeremiah, where both leaders and people are indicted for their unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>). The phrase underscores the pervasive nature of sin and rebellion, affecting all levels of society, and foreshadows the coming judgment due to their collective disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
