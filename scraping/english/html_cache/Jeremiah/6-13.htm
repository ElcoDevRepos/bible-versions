It highlights that the problem of greed and moral decay is not limited to a specific class or group but affects the entire society. This mirrors the situation in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3-4</a>, where societal corruption is widespread. The phrase underscores the universality of sin, a theme that is consistent throughout Scripture, emphasizing that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><b>all are greedy for gain</b><br>Greed is identified as a root cause of the societal decay. This greed for material wealth and power is condemned throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, where the love of money is described as the root of all kinds of evil. The pursuit of dishonest gain is a violation of the commandments and reflects a heart turned away from God. This greed contrasts with the biblical call to contentment and trust in God's provision (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><b>from prophet to priest</b><br>The mention of both prophets and priests indicates that even those who were supposed to be spiritual leaders and guides for the people were complicit in the corruption. This echoes the criticism found in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26-28</a>, where religious leaders are accused of failing to distinguish between the holy and the common. The failure of these leaders to uphold God's standards is a significant factor in the nation's spiritual decline.<p><b>all practice deceit</b><br>Deceit among the leaders and people reflects a broader theme of unfaithfulness to God. This deceit is not only a personal sin but also a betrayal of the covenant relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>. The practice of deceit is contrary to the nature of God, who is truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), and it undermines the trust and justice that should characterize a godly society.
