Drinking from this cup signifies experiencing divine punishment. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, where the cup represents God's wrath.<p><b>and stagger</b><br>The staggering represents the disorientation and confusion that result from God's judgment. This imagery is akin to the effects of drunkenness, illustrating the overwhelming nature of divine retribution. It reflects the chaos and instability that will befall the nations as a consequence of their actions.<p><b>and go out of their minds</b><br>This phrase indicates a loss of reason and sanity, a common result of severe distress and divine judgment. It suggests a complete breakdown of societal order and personal stability, as seen in other biblical accounts of judgment, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:28</a>, where God warns of madness as a curse for disobedience.<p><b>because of the sword</b><br>The sword is a frequent biblical metaphor for war and destruction, often used to describe God's instrument of judgment. In this context, it signifies the impending military invasions and conflicts that will serve as the means of executing divine justice. This is consistent with the historical context of Jeremiah's time, where Babylon was the instrument of God's judgment against the nations.<p><b>that I will send among them.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and active role in orchestrating the events of judgment. It underscores the prophetic theme that God uses nations and historical events to fulfill His purposes. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where God directs the course of history, as seen in <a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a> and <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing impending judgment due to its persistent idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Various nations surrounding Judah, including Egypt, Philistia, Moab, Ammon, and Babylon, which were also subject to God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>A metaphor for war and destruction, symbolizing God's judgment upon the nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup_of_wrath.htm">The Cup of Wrath</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of God's judgment, which the nations are made to drink, leading to their downfall and confusion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and inevitable for those who persist in disobedience and idolatry.

Jeremiah has just handed the nations &#8220;the cup of the wine of wrath&#8221; from the LORD (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>), so the drinking is literal prophetic imagery of God compelling them to receive His judgment.<p>&#8226; Isaiah uses the same picture&#8212;&#8220;the cup of His fury&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>)&#8212;to describe nations forced to swallow consequences they cannot escape.<p>&#8226; Revelation later echoes the theme: &#8220;He too will drink the wine of God&#8217;s anger&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The point is unmistakable: when God says &#8220;drink,&#8221; no nation can refuse the cup.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And stagger</b><p>&#8226; Staggering pictures the debilitating effect of divine judgment&#8212;like soldiers reeling after a blow.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a> says, &#8220;You have made us drink wine that makes us stagger,&#8221; linking physical wobbling to spiritual disorientation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/46-12.htm">Jeremiah 46:12</a> describes Egypt&#8217;s warriors &#8220;stumbling repeatedly,&#8221; showing how God&#8217;s blows leave even the mighty off balance.<p>&#8226; The image reassures the faithful that God&#8217;s justice never misses its mark; the proud will totter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go out of their minds</b><p>&#8226; Panic and confusion follow the staggering. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-34.htm">Deuteronomy 28:34</a> predicted, &#8220;You will go mad from the things you see,&#8221; whenever covenant curses fall.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/12-4.htm">Zechariah 12:4</a> promises the LORD will strike horses with panic and riders with madness, a chaos only divine power could unleash.<p>&#8226; When God&#8217;s cup is poured, clarity departs; rulers and armies make reckless choices that hasten their downfall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because of the sword I send among them</b><p>&#8226; The cause of the collapse is spelled out: God&#8217;s sword. Rebellion brings real warfare, not mere symbolism.<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25</a> warns, &#8220;I will bring a sword against you to avenge the covenant,&#8221; and <a href="/ezekiel/14-17.htm">Ezekiel 14:17</a> repeats the same penalty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a> personifies the weapon: &#8220;O sword of the LORD, how long till you rest?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Every empire that trusts its own blade discovers the ultimate sword is wielded by God Himself (cf. <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> where earthly authority &#8220;does not bear the sword in vain&#8221; under His sovereignty).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a> compresses a four-step drama of divine judgment: God forces the nations to drink His wrath, they reel in helpless confusion, they slip into irrational panic, and finally they face the literal sword He unleashes. The verse assures believers that the LORD&#8217;s justice is active, precise, and unstoppable&#8212;every proud power that lifts itself against Him will drink, stagger, lose reason, and fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">They shall drink . . .</span>--The words describe what history has often witnessed, the panic-terror of lesser nations before the onward march of a great conqueror--they are as if stricken with a drunken madness, and their despair or their resistance is equally infatuated. The imagery is one familiar in earlier prophets. (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm" title="Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.">Isaiah 51:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/51-22.htm" title="Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:">Isaiah 51:22</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/2-16.htm" title="You are filled with shame for glory: drink you also, and let your foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned to you, and shameful spewing shall be on your glory.">Habakkuk 2:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/60-5.htm" title="That your beloved may be delivered; save with your right hand, and hear me.">Psalm 60:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-31.htm" title="You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.">Ezekiel 23:31</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be moved, and be mad</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and reel to and fro</span>, <span class="accented">and behave themselves madly</span>. The inspired writers do not scruple to ascribe all phenomena, the "bad" as well as the "good," to a Divine operation. "Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?" (<a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). "An evil spirit from Elohim came upon Saul, and he became frenzied" (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; see also <a href="/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, and especially the very remarkable prologue of the Book of Job). To understand this form of expression, we must remember the strength of the reaction experienced by the prophets against the polytheism of the surrounding nations. It was not open to them to account for the existence of evil by ascribing it to the activity of various divinities; they knew Jehovah to be the sole cause in the universe. To us, "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought," such a doctrine occasions "great searchings of heart," and is sometimes a sore trial of our faith. But the prophets were not logicians, and their faith, compared to ours, was as an oak tree to a sapling; hence they can generally (see, however, <a href="/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>) express the truth of the universal causation of Jehovah with perfect tranquility. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the sword</span>. Here Jeremiah deserts the figure of the Cup, and, as most commentators think, uses the language of fact. It is not, however, certain that "the sword" means that of God's human instruments; Jehovah himself has a sword (<a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>; and elsewhere), just as he has a hand (<a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>) and an arm (<a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>). All these belong to a group of childlike symbolic expressions for the manifestation of the Deity. Jehovah's "sword" is described more fully in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; it "turns hither and thither," like the lightning - a striking figure of the completeness with which God performs his work of vengeance (see also on ver. 27). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And they will drink</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1429;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
