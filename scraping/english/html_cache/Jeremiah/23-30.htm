It is often used by prophets to introduce a divine pronouncement. The use of "behold" emphasizes the seriousness and certainty of God's message.<p><b>declares the LORD,</b><br>This phrase asserts the authority of the message, affirming that it comes directly from Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel. It underscores the divine origin of the prophecy and the seriousness with which it should be received.<p><b>I am against the prophets</b><br>God expresses His opposition to certain prophets, indicating a direct confrontation. In the context of Jeremiah, these are false prophets who mislead the people. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God opposes those who distort His word, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ezekiel/13-8.htm">Ezekiel 13:8-9</a>.<p><b>who steal from one another words</b><br>This phrase suggests plagiarism among the prophets, where they borrow or copy messages from each other rather than receiving genuine revelations from God. It highlights the lack of authenticity and divine inspiration in their messages.<p><b>they attribute to Me.</b><br>The false prophets claim divine authority for their messages, misleading the people by presenting their own words as if they were from God. This is a serious offense, as it involves taking God's name in vain and misrepresenting His will, a violation of the commandment found in <a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>.

(cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15&#8211;20</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Behold&#8221; signals urgency&#8212;God wants His people to stop, look, and listen. Similar divine calls for attention appear in <a href="/isaiah/65-6.htm">Isaiah 65:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>, underscoring that when the Lord says &#8220;behold,&#8221; something decisive is at hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>&#8226; These words underscore that the statement carries the weight of divine authority, not Jeremiah&#8217;s personal opinion (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Because &#8220;all Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), every syllable of the indictment is true and binding. The phrase reminds readers that rejecting the message is equivalent to rejecting God Himself (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am against the prophets</b><p>&#8226; God positions Himself as the adversary of counterfeit spokesmen&#8212;an alarming reversal of what prophets should be, namely, His representatives and intercessors (<a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar pronouncements appear in <a href="/ezekiel/13-8.htm">Ezekiel 13:8&#8211;9</a>: &#8220;I am against you, declares the Lord GOD.&#8221; When the Almighty opposes someone, defeat is certain (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s stance exposes the lie that sincerity or popularity can shield a teacher from judgment (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who steal from one another words they attribute to Me</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Steal&#8221; reveals moral corruption: they plagiarize each other&#8217;s imaginations and pass them off as fresh revelation. This is spiritual theft, robbing God of honor and people of truth (<a href="/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The offense is compounded because the borrowed phrases are labeled &#8220;Thus says the LORD,&#8221; forging God&#8217;s signature on human opinion (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The practice creates an echo chamber of error, suppressing genuine prophecy and lulling listeners into false security (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God later warns that such prophets cause His name to be &#8220;remembered no more&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a>), showing how counterfeit revelation erodes covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/23-30.htm">Jeremiah 23:30</a> is God&#8217;s forceful declaration that He personally opposes prophets who recycle one another&#8217;s fabricated messages and stamp them with His name. The verse calls believers to discernment, reminding us that God alone authorizes true prophecy, guards His Word, and will judge every distortion of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">That steal my words . . .</span>--Another note of the counterfeit prophet is found in the want of any living personal originality. The oracles of the dreamers were patchworks of plagiarism, and they borrowed, not as men might do legitimately, and as Jeremiah himself did, from the words of the great teachers of the past, but from men of their own time, false and unreal as themselves. What we should call the "clique" of false prophets went on repeating each other's phrases with a wearisome iteration. In "my words" we have, probably, the fact that, in part also, they decked out their teaching with the borrowed plumes of phrases from true prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-32.</span> - The punishment solemnly introduced by a three times repeated, <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I am against</span>, etc., corresponding to three several features of the conduct of the false prophets. First we are told that the prophets <span class="cmt_word">steal my words every one from his neighbor</span>. The latter part of the phrase reminds us of ver. 27, but the neighbor in this case must mean, at any rate primarily, a fellow-prophet, one who has really received a revelation at first-hand from Jehovah. The "false prophets," not trusting to their "dreams" alone, listen greedily to the discourses of men like Jeremiah, not with a view to spiritual profit, but to making their own utterances more effective. We must remember that they lived by their prophesying (<a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Therefore</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
