The whispering indicates secretive plotting and slander against him. This reflects the broader context of Jeremiah's ministry, where he was often isolated and opposed by his own people (<a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>). The whispering can be seen as a form of psychological warfare, aiming to undermine his confidence and mission.<p><b>&#8220;Terror is on every side!</b><br>This phrase, "Magor-missabib" in Hebrew, is a recurring theme in Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25, 46</a>:5). It signifies the pervasive fear and impending judgment that Jeremiah proclaimed. Historically, this reflects the socio-political instability of Judah, threatened by powerful empires like Babylon. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Report him; let us report him!&#8221;</b><br>The call to report Jeremiah suggests a betrayal and a desire to silence his prophetic voice. This mirrors the experience of other prophets and even Jesus Christ, who faced false accusations and betrayal (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>). It highlights the resistance to God's message and the lengths to which people will go to suppress it.<p><b>All my trusted friends watch for my fall:</b><br>Jeremiah's lament reveals the deep personal betrayal he experienced. Those he considered allies turned against him, reflecting the broader theme of trust and betrayal found throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). This foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, one of His disciples (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Perhaps he will be deceived so that we may prevail against him</b><br>The hope that Jeremiah might be deceived indicates a desire to discredit his prophetic authority. This reflects the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart of those opposing God's message. It parallels the attempts to trap Jesus in His words (<a href="/luke/20-20.htm">Luke 20:20-26</a>), showing the persistent opposition to divine truth.<p><b>and take our vengeance upon him.&#8221;</b><br>The desire for vengeance reveals the deep-seated animosity towards Jeremiah. It underscores the human tendency to retaliate against those who challenge or convict us. Biblically, vengeance is reserved for God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>), highlighting the sinful nature of taking justice into one's own hands. This also points to the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Christ, who bore the vengeance of humanity's sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.
