The imagery of an "outstretched arm" is often used in the Old Testament to depict God's mighty acts of deliverance and judgment, such as in <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>, where God promises to deliver Israel from Egypt. It signifies strength and active intervention in the world. The power of God is a recurring theme, underscoring His ability to create, sustain, and govern the universe.<p><b>I made the earth and the men and beasts on the face of it</b><br>This statement affirms God as the Creator of all things, echoing <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth, and all living creatures. It establishes His authority over creation, as everything originates from His will and design. This creation account is foundational to understanding humanity's place in the world and our relationship with God, as well as the inherent value of all life.<p><b>and I give it to whom I please</b><br>Here, God's sovereignty over the distribution of land and power is highlighted. This reflects the biblical theme that God raises up and deposes rulers according to His purposes, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>. It serves as a reminder that human authority is ultimately subject to divine will.

The whole preface, which rises to a height of rhythmic loftiness not common in Jeremiah's writings, asserts the truth that the Creator of the material world is also the ruler over the kingdoms of the earth. For a like utterance of the same thought, see <a href="/amos/4-13.htm" title="For, see, he that forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought, that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.">Amos 4:13</a>; <a href="/amos/9-6.htm" title="It is he that builds his stories in the heaven, and has founded his troop in the earth; he that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.">Amos 9:6</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - Jehovah is the Creator and Proprietor of the earth and all that is therein.
