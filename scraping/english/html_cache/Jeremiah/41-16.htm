His leadership role is significant as he attempts to restore order. The mention of "all the commanders" suggests a collective military effort, highlighting the importance of unity among the remaining leaders of Judah. This reflects the chaotic political situation following the fall of Jerusalem.<p><b>took the whole remnant of the people from Mizpah</b><br>Mizpah served as a temporary administrative center after Jerusalem's destruction. The "remnant" refers to those left in the land after the Babylonian exile, emphasizing God's continued concern for His people despite their reduced numbers. This remnant theme is recurrent in prophetic literature, symbolizing hope and future restoration.<p><b>whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah</b><br>Ishmael's actions, including the assassination of Gedaliah, represent internal strife and betrayal among the Jews. Johanan's recovery of the people from Ishmael underscores his role as a deliverer, drawing a parallel to the theme of redemption found throughout Scripture.<p><b>after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam</b><br>Gedaliah's assassination marks a pivotal moment of instability. Appointed by the Babylonians, Gedaliah's death signifies the collapse of any semblance of governance. This event fulfills Jeremiah's earlier warnings about the consequences of disobedience and rebellion against God's appointed leaders.<p><b>the soldiers, women, children, and court officials</b><br>The diverse group mentioned highlights the comprehensive nature of the community affected by the turmoil. The inclusion of soldiers, women, and children indicates the widespread impact of the political upheaval. This mirrors the biblical theme of God's concern for all members of society, regardless of status or gender.<p><b>he had brought back from Gibeon</b><br>Gibeon, a city with historical significance, was known for its earlier covenant with Israel during Joshua's time. The return from Gibeon symbolizes a return to a place of covenant, suggesting a potential for renewal and restoration. This geographical reference ties into the broader narrative of God's faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/johanan_son_of_kareah.htm">Johanan son of Kareah</a></b><br>A military leader who opposed Ishmael's actions and sought to protect the remnant of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael_son_of_nethaniah.htm">Ishmael son of Nethaniah</a></b><br>A member of the royal family who assassinated Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gedaliah_son_of_ahikam.htm">Gedaliah son of Ahikam</a></b><br>The appointed governor of Judah by the Babylonians, known for his efforts to stabilize the region post-exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>A significant location in Judah where Gedaliah governed and where the remnant gathered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>A city in ancient Israel from which Johanan recovered the people taken by Ishmael.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Johanan's actions demonstrate the importance of stepping up to protect and lead others in times of crisis.
