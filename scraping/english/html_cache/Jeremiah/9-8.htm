In the ancient Near Eastern context, arrows were a common weapon of war, symbolizing precision and lethality. The metaphor suggests that the people&#8217;s speech is not only harmful but intentionally so, aimed to cause damage. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that emphasize the power of the tongue, such as <a href="/proverbs/12-18.htm">Proverbs 12:18</a>, which contrasts reckless words with those that bring healing. The use of "deadly arrows" underscores the severity of the deceit and betrayal among the people, reflecting a society where trust has been eroded.<p><b>they speak deception.</b><br>Deception here refers to the falsehoods and lies that permeate the community. In the historical context of Jeremiah, the people of Judah were often accused of idolatry and unfaithfulness to God, which included deceitful practices. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of truth versus falsehood, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>, which describes the wicked as having no truth in their mouths. The emphasis on deception also points to a spiritual condition where the people have turned away from God&#8217;s truth, leading to moral and social decay.<p><b>With his mouth a man speaks peace to his neighbor,</b><br>This phrase illustrates the duplicity of the people, who outwardly express peace and goodwill while harboring malicious intent. In the cultural context, greeting a neighbor with peace was a common social practice, reflecting a desire for harmony and mutual respect. However, the insincerity of these greetings is highlighted, revealing a deeper issue of hypocrisy. This behavior is reminiscent of the Pharisees in the New Testament, whom Jesus criticized for their outward displays of righteousness while being inwardly corrupt (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<p><b>but in his heart he sets a trap for him.</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's thoughts, intentions, and emotions. Setting a trap indicates premeditated harm, suggesting that the deceit is not accidental but deliberate. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the heart's condition, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful above all things. The imagery of setting a trap also connects to the concept of sin as a snare, a recurring motif in scripture that warns of the dangers of hidden sins and the importance of integrity. This duplicity is a stark contrast to the character of Jesus Christ, who embodies truth and sincerity, offering a model of genuine love and honesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of their sinful ways and the impending judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_judah.htm">People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's prophecy, known for their deceitful and hypocritical behavior during this period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate speaker through Jeremiah, expressing His displeasure with the people's deceit and hypocrisy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>Represents the individuals within the community who are victims of deceit and false peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central place where these events and prophecies are directed, as the heart of Judah's spiritual and social life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words can be as destructive as weapons.
