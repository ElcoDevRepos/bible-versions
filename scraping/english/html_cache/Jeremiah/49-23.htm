It was a center of trade and military power. In biblical prophecy, Damascus often symbolizes the enemies of Israel. This prophecy against Damascus indicates God's judgment on nations surrounding Israel, reflecting the broader theme of divine justice.<p><b>Hamath and Arpad are put to shame:</b><br>Hamath and Arpad were prominent cities in Syria, north of Damascus. Hamath was a major city-state, often mentioned in the context of Assyrian conquests. Arpad, located near modern-day Aleppo, was also significant in regional politics. Their shame indicates defeat and humiliation, likely due to military conquest or divine judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>for they have heard a bad report;</b><br>The "bad report" likely refers to news of impending invasion or disaster, possibly from the Assyrian or Babylonian empires. In the ancient Near East, news of military campaigns spread quickly, causing fear and panic. This phrase underscores the power of God's judgment as it unfolds in history.<p><b>they are agitated like the sea;</b><br>The imagery of the sea conveys chaos and turmoil, common in biblical literature to describe nations in distress. The sea often symbolizes uncontrollable forces, reflecting the overwhelming nature of the threat facing these cities. This metaphor highlights the intensity of their fear and the inevitability of divine judgment.<p><b>their anxiety cannot be calmed:</b><br>The inability to calm their anxiety suggests a situation beyond human control, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment. This phrase resonates with the biblical theme of human helplessness in the face of divine will. It also serves as a reminder of the peace that only God can provide, contrasting the turmoil of those who oppose Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital of Syria, a significant city in biblical times known for its wealth and influence.

That ended, as Isaiah foretold, in the subjugation of Damascus by the Assyrians (<a href="/2_kings/16-9.htm" title="And the king of Assyria listened to him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.">2Kings 16:9</a>). And so the Syrians continued subject till the downfall of the Assyrian Empire, when they naturally fell before the power of Nebuchadnezzar. The language of the prophet is vague, but probably points to his attack. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-27.</span> - The heading <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Damascus</span> is too limited (like that of the partly parallel prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>); for the prophecy relates, not only to Damascus, the capital of the kingdom of southeastern Aram (or Syria), but to Hamath, the capital of the northern kingdom. (The third of the Aramaean kingdoms, that of Zobah, had ceased to exist.) Damascus had already been threatened by Amos (<a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-5</a>), and by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>). We may infer from the prophecy that Damascus had provoked the hostility of Nebuchadnezzar, but we have as yet no monumental evidence as to the facts. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. Still an important city under the name of Hamah, situated to the north of Hums (Emesa), on the Orontes. It formed nominally the boundary of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), was actually a part of the empire of Solomon (<a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), and was conquered for a short time by Jeroboam II. (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Under Sargon it was fully incorporated into the Assyrian empire (comp. <a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>); rebellious populations were repeatedly transplanted into the territory of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span>. Always mentioned together with Hamath, whose fate it appears to have shared (<a href="/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). A tell, or hill, with ruins, about three (German) miles from Aleppo, still bears the name Erfad (<span class="accented">Zeitschrift</span> of the German Oriental Society, 25:655). There is <span class="cmt_word">sorrow on the sea</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even the sea participates in the agitation of that troublous time: somewhat as in <a href="/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> the sea is represented as sympathizing in the terror produced by a Divine manifestation. But by the slightest possible emendation (viz. of <span class="accented">caph</span> into <span class="accented">beth</span>) we obtain a more natural sense - "with an unrest <span class="accented">as of</span> the sea, which cannot be quiet." In <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> we read, "For the ungodly are like the troubled sea, for it cannot be quiet;" and it can hardly be doubted that Jeremiah is alluding to this passage. If he altered it at all, it would be in the direction of greater smoothness rather than the reverse. Not a few manuscripts of Jeremiah actually have this corrected reading, which should probably be adopted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Concerning Damascus:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;am&#183;me&#183;&#347;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
