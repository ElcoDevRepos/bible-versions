The city is facing impending judgment due to its persistent sin and rebellion against God. Historically, Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and identity, yet it had turned away from God, leading to its desolation. The rhetorical question emphasizes the lack of compassion from surrounding nations, who often viewed Jerusalem as an adversary. This can be connected to <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>, where Jerusalem laments its own suffering and the absence of comforters. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate compassion found in Christ, who weeps over Jerusalem in <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>, showing divine pity and love.<p><b>Who will mourn for you?</b><br>Mourning in ancient Israel was a significant cultural practice, often involving public displays of grief. The absence of mourners signifies complete abandonment and isolation. This reflects the severity of Jerusalem's situation, as even its allies and neighbors would not lament its downfall. The lack of mourning can be seen as a consequence of the city's own actions, having broken covenant with God and ignored prophetic warnings. This phrase echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>, where desolation and destruction leave none to console. It also points to the future mourning over the rejection of the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, where the inhabitants of Jerusalem will mourn for the one they pierced.<p><b>Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?</b><br>Turning aside implies a deliberate action to show concern or interest. In the context of Jeremiah, it highlights the complete neglect and disregard for Jerusalem's plight. This neglect is a result of the city's own spiritual adultery and idolatry, leading to its alienation from God and man. The phrase suggests a lack of intercessors or advocates, contrasting with the role of Christ as the ultimate intercessor who cares for the welfare of His people (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the importance of community and compassion, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33</a>), where true neighborly love is demonstrated by those who turn aside to help the afflicted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

When the Lord says none will pity Jerusalem, it signals that the nation has forfeited even that natural human reflex because they first spurned divine mercy (<a href="/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene echoes <a href="/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;These double calamities have befallen you&#8230; who will lament you?&#8221;&#8212;showing continuity in the prophetic warning.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s people were called to be a light to the nations (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), yet persistent idolatry reversed that witness. Now the surrounding peoples see only ruin, not a testimony worth pitying.<p>&#8226; The literal fulfillment came in 586 BC when Babylon razed Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17&#8211;19</a>). No one intervened, confirming every word spoken here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will mourn for you?</b><p>Mourning suggests shared sorrow, but Jerusalem stands isolated.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a> pictures passersby indifferent to Zion&#8217;s agony&#8212;Jeremiah&#8217;s words turned into eyewitness lament.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a> shows the prophet himself weeping, yet the city at large refused to repent. Their unwillingness to mourn over sin ensured they would mourn over judgment (<a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The ultimate Man of Sorrows, Jesus, later wept over this same city (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), proving God&#8217;s heart still breaks even when judgment is deserved.<p>&#8226; For believers today, true mourning over sin leads to comfort (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). The absence of mourners here exposes hearts hardened beyond repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?</b><p>Turning aside implies effort and personal cost. No one is willing.<p>&#8226; Job&#8217;s friends at least arrived to &#8220;sympathize and comfort&#8221; (<a href="/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). Jerusalem finds no such visitors.<p>&#8226; The parable of the priest and Levite who &#8220;passed by on the other side&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-31.htm">Luke 10:31&#8211;32</a>) captures the scene: people see distress yet choose distance.<p>&#8226; In covenant terms, refusing to seek a brother&#8217;s welfare violates love of neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The fact that even surrounding nations with no covenant tie refuse to inquire underscores the depth of Jerusalem&#8217;s estrangement.<p>&#8226; God alone ultimately &#8220;regards the prayer of the destitute&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/102-17.htm">Psalm 102:17</a>). Yet here He withholds that relief because the people persist in rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/15-6.htm">Jeremiah 15:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5</a> paints a stark picture of a city so hardened in sin that pity, mourning, and concern vanish. The refusal of others to show compassion mirrors the Lord&#8217;s righteous judgment: when divine mercy is repeatedly rejected, even human mercy dries up. The verse stands as a sober reminder that sin isolates, hardens, and invites consequences, while also exposing the ache in God&#8217;s heart that longs for repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">To ask how thou doest?</span>--This is a fair paraphrase of the original, but it wants the Oriental colouring of the more literal <span class= "ital">to ask after thy peace. </span>As "Peace be with thee" was the usual formula of salutation, sc.," Is it peace?" was the equivalent for our more prosaic question, "How do you do?"
