The command to "build houses" suggests a long-term stay, indicating that their exile would not be brief. This instruction contrasts with the Israelites' previous experiences of temporary dwellings, such as tents during their wilderness journey. The call to "settle down" implies a shift from a transient lifestyle to one of stability and permanence, encouraging the exiles to establish roots in a foreign land. This reflects God's sovereignty and His plans for the Israelites, even in captivity, as He assures them of His continued presence and purpose. Theologically, this can be seen as a call to trust in God's timing and provision, even when circumstances are challenging.<p><b>Plant gardens and eat their produce.</b><br>The act of planting gardens signifies an investment in the future, as gardens take time to cultivate and yield produce. This command encourages the exiles to engage in agricultural activities, which were central to their way of life and sustenance. Eating the produce of their gardens symbolizes self-sufficiency and the ability to thrive even in exile. This phrase also echoes the creation mandate in Genesis, where humanity is tasked with cultivating the earth. It serves as a reminder of God's provision and the importance of stewardship. Additionally, this instruction can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth and fruitfulness, encouraging believers to cultivate their faith and trust in God's promises, even in difficult circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages to the people of Judah, including those in exile in Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/exiles_in_babylon.htm">Exiles in Babylon</a></b><br>The Israelites who were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar and lived in Babylon during the Babylonian exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites were exiled, a foreign land with different customs and beliefs.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_instruction.htm">God's Instruction</a></b><br>Through Jeremiah, God instructs the exiles to build houses and plant gardens, indicating a period of settlement and adaptation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who conquered Jerusalem and led the Israelites into exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/embrace_your_current_season.htm">Embrace Your Current Season</a></b><br>Just as the exiles were instructed to build and plant, we are called to be faithful and productive in our current circumstances, trusting in God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/seek_peace_and_prosperity.htm">Seek Peace and Prosperity</a></b><br>By settling down and investing in their community, the exiles were contributing to the peace and prosperity of the place where God had placed them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/long-term_vision.htm">Long-term Vision</a></b><br>Building houses and planting gardens requires a long-term perspective, reminding us to invest in things that have lasting value and impact.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Even in exile, the Israelites were to trust in God's promise of future restoration, teaching us to hold onto hope and faith in God's timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_participation_in_god's_plan.htm">Active Participation in God's Plan</a></b><br>The call to build and plant is an invitation to actively participate in God's unfolding plan, rather than passively waiting for change.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_29_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 29:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_29_5_s_call_for_community_ties.htm">How does Jeremiah 29:5 encourage long-term commitment in our communities today?

It counselled a patient acceptance of the present state of things. It announced, as the next verse does yet more emphatically, that their exile would last for at least two generations. It indicates, also, the comparative leniency with which the exiles were treated. They were allowed to become possessors both of lands and houses. The favour shown to Daniel and his friends would, of course, tend to make their condition more tolerable.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Build</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">houses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;t&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and settle down.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1425;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
