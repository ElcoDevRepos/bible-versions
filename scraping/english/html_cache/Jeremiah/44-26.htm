Despite their disobedience in seeking refuge in Egypt against God's command (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19-22</a>), God still reaches out to them. The phrase "hear the word of the LORD" emphasizes the authority and importance of God's message, a recurring theme in prophetic literature. The people of Judah in Egypt are reminded that they are still under God's jurisdiction, even in a foreign land.<p><b>Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD,</b><br>God's swearing by His own name underscores the seriousness and certainty of His pronouncement. In ancient Near Eastern culture, swearing by one's name was a binding oath, and God's name is the highest authority. This reflects God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His word, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>, where God swears by Himself because there is no greater.<p><b>that never again will any man of Judah living in the land of Egypt invoke My name or say,</b><br>This part of the prophecy indicates a severe judgment. The ability to invoke God's name is a privilege and a sign of relationship with Him. The removal of this privilege signifies a broken relationship due to persistent idolatry and disobedience. It echoes the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to separation from God's blessings.<p><b>&#8216;As surely as the Lord GOD lives.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase was a common oath formula in Israel, affirming the truthfulness of a statement by invoking the living God as a witness. The prohibition of this phrase among the Judahites in Egypt highlights their spiritual downfall and the loss of their identity as God's people. It serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, paralleling the warnings given in <a href="/jeremiah/11-10.htm">Jeremiah 11:10-11</a> about the consequences of breaking the covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jews_in_egypt.htm">The Jews in Egypt</a></b><br>These are the remnants of Judah who fled to Egypt after the fall of Jerusalem, despite God's command to remain in the land He had given them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A place of refuge for the Jews who disobeyed God's command to stay in Judah.

The people have persisted in idol worship (<a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15&#8211;19</a>), but the Lord steps in with an unchanging verdict. Similar pivots appear in <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a> and <a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>, where stubborn hearts meet God&#8217;s final word. Here, no amount of pleading or ritual can override divine holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hear the word of the LORD</b><p>This familiar prophetic summons drives home that what follows is not Jeremiah&#8217;s opinion but God&#8217;s unfiltered decree (<a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>; 7:2). It is grace that He still speaks; yet ignoring that grace invites discipline (<a href="/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All you people of Judah living in Egypt</b><p>The remnant fled to Egypt against explicit warning (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19</a>; 43:7). They thought distance from Jerusalem meant distance from judgment. Instead, God addresses them where they settled&#8212;proof <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a> is true: no place shelters us from His reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD</b><p>When God swears &#8220;by My great name,&#8221; He calls on the highest authority&#8212;Himself (<a href="/amos/6-8.htm">Amos 6:8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a>). His name embodies character, faithfulness, power.

Stripped of that privilege, the fugitives become spiritually orphaned&#8212;true exile. Like Saul losing kingdom rights (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>), they lose the honor of bearing the Lord&#8217;s name (<a href="/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or say, &#8216;As surely as the Lord GOD lives.&#8217;</b><p>&#8220;&#8202;As surely as the Lord lives&#8221; is the classic Hebrew oath (<a href="/judges/8-19.htm">Judges 8:19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>). Removing it silences their religious veneer. They can mouth Egyptian gods, but the true God will not let His name be used lightly (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>&#8212;false oaths lead to divine prohibition.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Jeremiah 44:26</a> is God&#8217;s solemn declaration that the Judean refugees in Egypt have crossed a line.

The verse underscores God&#8217;s omnipresence, the seriousness of His oaths, and the covenant loss that comes when people persistently reject His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/44.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My Name shall no more be named.</span> Because no Jews will be left alive in Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/44-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3651.htm">Strong's 3651: </a> </span><span class="str2">So -- thus</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you Jews</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">living</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
