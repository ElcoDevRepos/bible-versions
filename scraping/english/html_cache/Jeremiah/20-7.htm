The Hebrew word for "deceived" can also mean "enticed" or "persuaded," indicating Jeremiah's feeling that God led him into a prophetic ministry that brought him suffering. This echoes the experience of other prophets who faced hardship, such as Moses (<a href="/exodus/5-22.htm">Exodus 5:22-23</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). Theologically, this phrase highlights the tension between divine sovereignty and human experience, where God's plans may not align with human expectations. Jeremiah's complaint is not unique; it parallels the lament psalms where the psalmists express feelings of abandonment (<a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>).<p><b>You have overcome me and prevailed.</b><br>Jeremiah acknowledges God's overpowering influence in his life. The language of being "overcome" suggests a wrestling match, reminiscent of Jacob's struggle with God (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>). This indicates the intensity of Jeremiah's internal conflict and submission to God's will. Historically, prophets often faced resistance, both internally and externally, as they delivered God's messages. Jeremiah's submission to God's overpowering call is a testament to the compelling nature of divine vocation, which can override personal desires and fears.<p><b>I am a laughingstock all day long;</b><br>Jeremiah's role as a prophet subjected him to public ridicule and scorn. In ancient Near Eastern culture, prophets were often marginalized figures, especially when their messages were unpopular. Jeremiah's experience is similar to that of other prophets like Hosea and Ezekiel, who also faced derision. This phrase underscores the cost of prophetic ministry, where faithfulness to God's message often leads to social ostracism. The New Testament echoes this theme, as Jesus and His disciples also faced mockery (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>, <a href="/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>).<p><b>everyone mocks me.</b><br>The universal nature of the mockery Jeremiah faced highlights the widespread rejection of his message. This reflects the broader cultural and spiritual climate of Judah, where the people were resistant to repentance and change. Jeremiah's experience prefigures the rejection of Christ, who was also mocked and scorned by the masses (<a href="/mark/15-29.htm">Mark 15:29-32</a>). This connection emphasizes the prophetic role as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate rejection and suffering of Jesus for the sake of truth and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse.

His lament teaches that God welcomes transparent prayer, that suffering and mockery often accompany faithful witness, and that the Lord who &#8220;overcame&#8221; Jeremiah will also sustain him&#8212;and us&#8212;through every trial.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">O Lord, thou hast deceived me.</span>--There is an obvious break between <a href="/context/jeremiah/20-6.htm" title="And you, Pashur, and all that dwell in your house shall go into captivity: and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and shall be buried there, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied lies.">Jeremiah 20:6-7</a>. The narrative ends, and a psalm of passionate complaint begins. Its position probably indicates that the compiler of the prophecies in their present form looked on the complaints as belonging to this period of the prophet's work, representing the thoughts of that night of shame which was, as it were, the extremest point of apparent failure. This then was the end of his prophetic calling, this the fulfilment of the promise which told him that he was set over the nations, and that his enemies should not prevail against him (<a href="/context/jeremiah/1-8.htm" title="Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with you to deliver you, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 1:8-10</a>). Some touches of this feeling we have heard already in <a href="/jeremiah/15-18.htm" title="Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether to me as a liar, and as waters that fail?">Jeremiah 15:18</a>.

He felt, in St. Paul's language, that "a necessity was laid upon" him (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1Corinthians 9:16</a>); or in Isaiah's, that the "strong hand" of the Lord was on him (<a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm" title="For the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,">Isaiah 8:11</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-13.</span> - A lyric passage, expressing the conflict in the prophet's mind owing to the mockery and the slander which his preaching has brought upon him, and at the same time his confidence of victory through the protection of Jehovah; a suitable sequel to the narrative which goes before, even if not originally written to occupy this position (see general Introduction). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast deceived me</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst entice me</span>, <span class="accented">and I let myself be enticed</span>. Jeremiah refers to the hesitation he originally felt to accepting the prophetic office (<a href="/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>.). The verb does not mean "to deceive," but "to entice" (so rendered in ver. 10, Authorized Version), or "allure." The same word is used in that remarkable narrative of "the spirit" who offered to "entice" (Authorized Version, to "persuade") Ahab to "go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead" (<a href="/1_kings/22-21.htm">1 Kings 22:21</a>). In Ezekiel, too, the same case is supposed as possible of Jehovah's "enticing" a prophet (Ezekiel 15:9). The expression implies that all events are, in some sense, caused by God, even those which are, or appear to be, injurious to the individual. Was Goethe thinking of this passage when he wrote the words, "Wen Gott betrugt, ist wohl be-trogon?" Applying the words in a Christian sense, we may say (with F. W. Robertson) that God teaches us by our illusions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst take hold on me</span>, <span class="accented">and didst prevail</span>.
