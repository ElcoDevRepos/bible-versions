Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as the one who delivers and sustains His people. The term "Hope" signifies trust and expectation in God's promises and faithfulness. In the context of Jeremiah, Israel is facing severe drought and impending disaster, and the prophet is appealing to God as their only hope. This reflects the covenant relationship where God promised to be their God and they His people (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>).<p><b>its Savior in times of distress</b><br>God is acknowledged as the Savior, emphasizing His role as a deliverer in times of trouble. Historically, Israel experienced numerous instances where God intervened to save them, such as the Exodus from Egypt and deliverance from various enemies during the time of the Judges. This phrase underscores the expectation that God will act in accordance with His character as a rescuer. It also foreshadows the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ, who is recognized in the New Testament as the Savior of all humanity (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a>).<p><b>why are You like a stranger in the land</b><br>Here, Jeremiah expresses a sense of divine absence or distance. The imagery of God as a "stranger" suggests a lack of intervention or presence, which is contrary to the Israelites' understanding of God dwelling among them, especially in the Temple in Jerusalem. This reflects the people's perception that God is not acting on their behalf during their crisis. It is a rhetorical question that highlights the tension between God's promises and the current experience of the people.<p><b>like a traveler who stays but a night?</b><br>This simile further emphasizes the perceived temporary and transient presence of God. A traveler who stays only for a night does not establish a lasting relationship or provide ongoing support. This imagery contrasts with God's covenant promise to dwell with His people permanently (<a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11-12</a>). The question implies a longing for God's enduring presence and intervention. It also serves as a call for repentance, as the people's sin has led to a sense of separation from God, a theme prevalent throughout the book of Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of God, specifically the southern kingdom of Judah during Jeremiah's time, who were experiencing a severe drought and seeking deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Referred to as the "Hope of Israel" and "Savior," highlighting His role as the ultimate deliverer and protector of His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/drought.htm">Drought</a></b><br>The immediate context of this verse is a severe drought that had struck the land, symbolizing God's judgment and the people's desperate need for divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/stranger/traveler.htm">Stranger/Traveler</a></b><br>Metaphors used to express the perceived distance and temporary presence of God among His people during their time of distress.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_our_hope_and_savior.htm">God as Our Hope and Savior</a></b><br>Recognize that God is our ultimate hope and savior, especially in times of distress.

From the Exodus onward, Israel&#8217;s future never depended on armies or alliances but on the unchanging character of the covenant-keeping God (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4-6</a>). The prophet deliberately starts with hope because even under judgment God&#8217;s promises remain intact (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>its Savior in times of distress</b><p>History backed up the title &#8220;Savior.&#8221; The same Lord who parted the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>), raised judges to rescue His people (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>), and overthrew enemy armies in Hezekiah&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) had not changed (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s prayer recounts that track record: when disaster struck, the Lord stepped in (<a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). By using the word &#8220;its,&#8221; Jeremiah reminds Judah that salvation is not generic; it is personal and covenantal, promised to this specific people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why are You like a stranger in the land</b><p>Now comes the tension. God seems distant, &#8220;like a stranger.&#8221; The drought of verses 1-6 feels like abandonment. Yet Scripture affirms that the Lord is never truly absent from His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The problem is sin, not God&#8217;s commitment (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). Judah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>) created a relational distance that felt as though God were only passing through. The lament echoes earlier cries: &#8220;Why, O LORD, do You stand far off?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a traveler who stays but a night</b><p>A traveler in ancient culture expected no long-term involvement; he rested overnight and moved on (<a href="/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1-2</a>). Judah fears God now fits that pattern&#8212;present one moment, gone the next. The irony is sharp: the Lord had pledged to dwell among them permanently (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45-46</a>), yet their own unfaithfulness made His presence feel temporary (<a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s wording highlights how sin warps perception: the eternal, omnipresent God appears transient when hearts are hardened (<a href="/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/14-8.htm">Jeremiah 14:8</a> captures a covenant people wrestling with the gap between God&#8217;s proven faithfulness and their immediate sense of abandonment.

The verse invites repentance and renewed trust in the God who never truly departs and who still desires to save those who return to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">As a wayfaring man . . .</span>--No image could paint more vividly the sense of abandonment which weighed on the prophet's heart.
