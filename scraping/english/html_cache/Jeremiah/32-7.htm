In the midst of national crisis, the LORD orchestrates Hanamel&#8217;s visit so Jeremiah can purchase a field as a tangible pledge that exile is not the end. The passage reassures believers that God&#8217;s word is exact, His sovereignty unchallenged, and His redemptive plan certain, even when current circumstances seem to contradict hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum . . .</span>--The teaching of the narrative that follows lies almost on the surface, and is brought out distinctly in <a href="/jeremiah/32-44.htm" title="Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 32:44</a>. "With all the certainty of desolation, misery, exile in the immediate future, the prophet was to give a practical proof that he was as certain of the ultimate restoration. It was worth while to buy a field even for what might seem the contingency of that remote reversion. Roman history records a parallel act of patriotic faith in the purchase of land at Rome at its full market value, at the very time when the armies of Hannibal were marching to the gate of the city (Livy, xxvi. 11). Nothing more is known of the Hanameel who is here mentioned than that he was the first cousin of the prophet (<a href="/context/jeremiah/32-8.htm" title="So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray you, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 32:8-9</a>). The word "uncle" in this verse therefore applies strictly to Shallum. As the lands belonging to the priests and Levites as such could not be alienated (<a href="/leviticus/25-34.htm" title="But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.">Leviticus 25:34</a>), we must assume either that the land in question had come into the family by marriage and was private property, or that the law had been so far relaxed as to allow of the transfer of land within the limits of the family, and up to the date of the next year of jubilee. In such a case, as in <a href="/ruth/3-12.htm" title="And now it is true that I am your near kinsman: however, there is a kinsman nearer than I.">Ruth 3:12</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-4.htm" title="And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.">Ruth 4:4</a>, the option of purchase was offered in <span class= "ital">the </span>first instance to the next of kin (the <span class= "ital">Goel, </span>or "redeemer," of the family), so that it might still be kept in the line of succession (<a href="/leviticus/25-24.htm" title="And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.">Leviticus 25:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-32.htm" title="Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.">Leviticus 25:32</a>). The prophet naturally lays stress on the fact that he was warned beforehand of the visit of Hanameel and of its object. The coincidence was to him what the arrival of the messenger of Cornelius was to Peter (<a href="/context/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19-21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hanameel</span>. Another form of <span class="accented">Hananeel</span>; comp. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, in the Septuagint = Goshen, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span> = Midian. In <a href="/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> the Authorized Version has <span class="accented">Hananeel</span>, and the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span> (of course, the persons referred to are different). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Shallum thine uncle.</span> It is strange that Hanameel should be called at once Jeremiah's uncle's son and his uncle; and yet this is the case - the former in vers. 8, 9, the latter in ver. 12. There is, therefore, no reason why we should deviate (as most commentators do) from the ordinary Hebrew usage, and suppose "thine uncle" in this verse to refer to Shallum, and not rather to Hanameel. But how are we to explain this singular variation in phraseology? Either from the fact that the Hebrew for "uncle" is simply a word expressive of affection (it means "beloved," see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), and might, therefore, just as well be applied to a cousin as to an uncle: or else. upon the supposition that the word for "son (of)" has fallen out of the text before "mine uncle," both in this verse and in ver. 12. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hanamel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;nam&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2601.htm">Strong's 2601: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hanamel -- Jeremiah's cousin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your uncle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
