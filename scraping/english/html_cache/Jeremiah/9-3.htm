In ancient warfare, a bow was a weapon of precision and power, symbolizing the intentional and targeted nature of their lies. The imagery suggests that their words are not only false but also harmful and destructive. This metaphor is consistent with other biblical passages that describe the tongue as a powerful tool, such as in <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-8</a>, where the tongue is likened to a small fire that can set a forest ablaze.<p><b>lies prevail over truth in the land.</b><br>The prevalence of lies over truth indicates a society deeply entrenched in deceit and moral corruption. This reflects the broader context of Jeremiah's ministry, where the people of Judah had turned away from God's commandments and embraced falsehoods. The land, representing the nation of Judah, is characterized by a lack of integrity and righteousness. This situation is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14-15</a>, where truth has stumbled in the streets, and honesty cannot enter. The cultural context of the time shows a society that has rejected divine truth in favor of self-serving deception.<p><b>For they proceed from evil to evil,</b><br>This phrase highlights the progressive nature of sin, where one act of evil leads to another. It underscores the idea that sin is not static but grows and multiplies when left unchecked. This progression from evil to evil is a common theme in the Bible, illustrating the depravity of the human heart without God's intervention. In <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-32</a>, Paul describes a similar downward spiral of sin, where people are given over to a depraved mind, leading to a cascade of wicked actions.<p><b>and they do not take Me into account,&#8221; declares the LORD.</b><br>The failure to consider God in their actions is the root cause of the people's moral decay. This phrase emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God in all aspects of life, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trusting in the Lord and acknowledging Him in all ways. The declaration by the LORD serves as a divine indictment against the people, highlighting their spiritual blindness and rebellion. This disregard for God is a recurring issue in the history of Israel and Judah, leading to their eventual judgment and exile. The prophetic voice of Jeremiah calls the people back to a covenant relationship with God, urging them to repent and return to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

There is a sad, stern irony in these words, which remind us of Isaiah's (<a href="/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>) "valiant men - for drinking wine" and of our own prophet's repetition of himself in <a href="/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>, "Their valor is - untruth." A less pointed form of the same figurative statement is that of the psalmist in <a href="/psalms/64-3.htm">Psalm 64:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the land</span>. The Authorized Version pays very little regard to the context in its rendering of the ambiguous word <span class="accented">erec</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;They bend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7695;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
