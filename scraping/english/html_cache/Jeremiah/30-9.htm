Historically, the Israelites often turned away from God, leading to their exile. This promise of serving the LORD again suggests a return to covenant faithfulness. It echoes the covenantal language found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-10</a>, where God promises to restore His people if they return to Him. The emphasis on serving the LORD highlights the centrality of worship and obedience in the life of the covenant community.<p><b>and David their king</b><br>This reference to "David their king" is significant in the context of biblical prophecy. It points to the Davidic Covenant found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>, where God promises David that his throne will be established forever. While David himself had long passed by the time of Jeremiah, this phrase is understood as a messianic prophecy, pointing to a future descendant of David who will reign as king. This is often interpreted as a reference to Jesus Christ, who is called the "Son of David" in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>whom I will raise up for them</b><br>The phrase "whom I will raise up for them" suggests divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promises. It implies a future action by God to establish a leader from David's line. This is seen as a prophetic reference to the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus Christ, who is believed to be the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic kingship. The concept of God raising up a leader is also seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in the raising of judges and prophets to deliver Israel (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16</a>). This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and faithfulness in bringing about His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises restoration and leadership under a divinely appointed king.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, representing the ideal king and a type of the Messiah.
