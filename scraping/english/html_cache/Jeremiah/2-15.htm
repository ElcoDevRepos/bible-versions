Here, "young lions" could refer to the emerging powers that threaten Israel, such as Babylon or Assyria. The roaring signifies a display of power and intimidation. In the context of Jeremiah, this imagery reflects the impending judgment and invasion due to Israel's unfaithfulness. The lion's roar is a metaphor for the fear and destruction that these nations will bring upon Israel.<p><b>they have sounded their voices.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the certainty and clarity of the threat. The "voices" of the lions symbolize the proclamations of war and conquest by foreign nations. This can be seen as a fulfillment of the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who spoke of the consequences of Israel's disobedience. The sounding of voices also indicates the inevitability of the coming judgment, as the nations announce their intentions.<p><b>They have laid waste his land;</b><br>This phrase describes the devastation that follows the invasion. The land, which was once fertile and prosperous, is now desolate. This destruction is a direct result of Israel's covenant unfaithfulness, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's law. The laying waste of the land serves as a tangible sign of divine judgment and a call to repentance.<p><b>his cities lie in ruins,</b><br>The cities, centers of culture, commerce, and community, are now destroyed. This reflects the historical reality of the Babylonian conquest, where cities like Jerusalem were besieged and demolished. The ruins symbolize the loss of security and identity for the people of Israel. This devastation is also a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as the cities that once stood as symbols of God's blessing are now testimonies to His judgment.<p><b>without inhabitant.</b><br>The absence of inhabitants signifies complete desolation and abandonment. This fulfills the prophetic warnings of exile and dispersion found in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The land, once teeming with life, is now empty, reflecting the spiritual barrenness that comes from forsaking God. This desolation also points to the hope of future restoration, as other prophecies, such as those in Ezekiel, speak of a time when God will gather His people back to the land and restore it to its former glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_lions.htm">Young Lions</a></b><br>Symbolic of powerful and aggressive nations or leaders that threaten and attack Israel.
