This location was a part of the royal palace complex, indicating a form of house arrest rather than a dungeon. The release of Jeremiah signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to protect him (<a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8</a>). It also highlights the shift in power dynamics following the Babylonian conquest, as the Babylonians respected Jeremiah's prophetic role.<p><b>and they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan</b><br>Gedaliah was appointed by the Babylonians as governor over the remnant in Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>). His lineage is significant; Ahikam, his father, had protected Jeremiah earlier (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and Shaphan, his grandfather, was a scribe during King Josiah's reign who played a role in the discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-14</a>). This connection underscores a continuity of faithfulness to God&#8217;s word within this family. Gedaliah's appointment represents a new administrative order under Babylonian rule, aiming to stabilize the region.<p><b>to take him home</b><br>This phrase indicates a restoration of Jeremiah's freedom and a return to normalcy after his imprisonment. "Home" suggests a place of safety and belonging, emphasizing God's faithfulness in preserving Jeremiah's life and ministry. It also symbolizes a return to his prophetic mission among the people, as he was now free to continue his work without the constraints of imprisonment.<p><b>So Jeremiah remained among his own people</b><br>Jeremiah's decision to stay with the remnant in Judah rather than go to Babylon reflects his commitment to his prophetic calling and his people. This choice aligns with his message of hope and restoration for those who remained (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>). It also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ, who remained with His people, offering guidance and hope amidst trials.

His presence assured them of God&#8217;s ongoing guidance, for the word of the LORD was still active locally (<a href="/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Remaining &#8220;among his own people&#8221; also illustrates servant leadership: Jeremiah chose hardship with the flock over comfort in Babylon, mirroring Moses&#8217; earlier choice (<a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; His continued ministry would warn against fleeing to Egypt (<a href="/bsb/jeremiah/42.htm">Jeremiah 42-44</a>), proving that God positions His messengers where their witness is most needed, not where life is easiest (<a href="/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a> records God&#8217;s swift reversal of His prophet&#8217;s fortunes: released from prison, entrusted to a trustworthy governor, granted freedom to return home, and left to serve the remnant in Judah. The verse underscores divine faithfulness to the obedient, the protection that accompanies courageous proclamation, and the calling to remain with God&#8217;s people even in their darkest hour.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Out of the court of the prison.</span>--There is a slight apparent discrepancy between this statement and that in <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm" title="The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive to Babylon.">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, that the prophet was set free at Ramah. It seems likely that, at first, he was sent back to the prison where he had been found, till he could be placed under the protection of Gedaliah.<p><span class= "bld">Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan.</span>--The reason of the choice lies almost on the surface. Gedaliah was the representative of a house which for three generations had been true to the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Shaphan had been the king's scribe in the early years of Josiah, and had taken an active part in the restoration of the Temple (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3-7</a>). He was the first to read the newly-found lost copy of the Law, which we identify with the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-8.htm" title="And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.">2Kings 22:8-14</a>), and his son Ahikam acted with him. The latter protected Jeremiah in the reign of Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm" title="Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.">Jeremiah 26:24</a>). His brother Gemariah gave the prophet the use of his chamber in the Temple (<a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), and tried to turn aside the king's wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>). And now the son of Ahikam appears as the prophet's friend and protector. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Gedaliah, whose father had already befriended the prophet on a serious occasion (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and who, according to <a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, had been appointed (though himself a Jew) Babylonian "governor over the cities of Judah," is directed to <span class="cmt_word">carry him</span> (Jeremiah) <span class="cmt_word">home</span>, or rather, <span class="accented">into the house</span>; obviously some house close by is meant - either Gedaliah's temporary dwelling or the royal palace.
