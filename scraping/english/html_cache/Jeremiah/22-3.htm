It is a common prophetic introduction, underscoring that the words are not Jeremiah's own but are directly from God. This establishes the seriousness and divine mandate of the instructions that follow.<p><b>Administer justice and righteousness:</b><br>Justice and righteousness are central themes in the Old Testament, reflecting God's character and His expectations for His people. In the context of ancient Israel, these terms often referred to fair legal practices and moral integrity. The call to administer justice and righteousness is a reminder of the covenantal responsibilities of the leaders and people of Judah, echoing the requirements found in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-20.htm">Deuteronomy 16:20</a> and <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>.<p><b>Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor:</b><br>This phrase highlights God's concern for the oppressed and the responsibility of leaders to protect the vulnerable. The imagery of "rescue" suggests active intervention, aligning with the biblical theme of God as a deliverer. This command reflects the social justice laws found in the Torah, such as those in <a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21-27</a>, which emphasize protection for the disadvantaged.<p><b>Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow:</b><br>Foreigners, orphans, and widows were often marginalized and lacked social protection in ancient societies. God's command to protect these groups is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a> and <a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>. This reflects God's compassion and the expectation that His people mirror His care for the vulnerable.<p><b>Do not shed innocent blood in this place:</b><br>The prohibition against shedding innocent blood underscores the sanctity of life and the importance of justice. "This place" likely refers to Jerusalem, the center of worship and justice in Judah. The command echoes the sixth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>) and highlights the moral decay that Jeremiah often condemns. It also foreshadows the coming judgment on Judah for their failure to uphold these divine standards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
