He was a military leader, likely of noble descent, who played a crucial role in the events following the Babylonian conquest. His actions are pivotal in the narrative of the remnant of Judah. Johanan's leadership is often seen as a stabilizing force amidst chaos, reflecting the need for strong leadership in times of crisis.<p><b>and all the commanders of the armies with him</b><br>The mention of "all the commanders of the armies" indicates a coalition of military leaders who were loyal to Gedaliah, the appointed governor by the Babylonians. This group represents the remaining organized military force in Judah, highlighting the fragmented state of the nation. Their unity under Johanan suggests a concerted effort to restore order and protect the people from further harm.<p><b>heard of all the crimes</b><br>The term "crimes" refers to the violent and treacherous acts committed by Ishmael. This includes the murder of Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor, and others who were with him. These acts were not only political assassinations but also betrayals that threatened the fragile peace and security of the remaining Judeans. The use of "crimes" underscores the moral and legal violations that Ishmael's actions represented.<p><b>that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed</b><br>Ishmael, son of Nethaniah, was of royal blood, possibly motivated by political ambition and resentment towards the Babylonian-appointed leadership. His actions can be seen as an attempt to reclaim power and assert independence from Babylonian control. Ishmael's betrayal and murder of Gedaliah were significant because they disrupted the efforts to stabilize the region and maintain a remnant in the land.

His name surfaces here to show God&#8217;s provision of a courageous protector even after Jerusalem&#8217;s fall. Like Joshua rising after Moses (<a href="/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1-2</a>), Johanan steps forward when the previous leadership is removed.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/jeremiah/41-13.htm">Jeremiah 41:13-16</a> records Johanan&#8217;s rescue mission, underscoring that God still raises deliverers for His remnant (cf. <a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Application: God frequently places faithful people ready to act when evil strikes; we can trust Him to do the same in our day.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the commanders of the armies with him</b><p>These &#8220;commanders&#8221; are the surviving captains of Judah&#8217;s scattered guerrilla bands (<a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>). Though the nation lay in ruins, a remnant of authority remained, reminding us that God never leaves Himself without witnesses (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: Ezekiel, writing from exile (<a href="/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16</a>), affirms that God is &#8220;a sanctuary&#8221; even among dispersed people, paralleling these scattered but unified leaders.<p>&#8226; Application: Spiritual unity around righteous leadership matters more than impressive numbers or favorable circumstances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard of</b><p>News travels quickly when lives are at stake. Hearing here prompts decisive action, much like Nehemiah reacted when he &#8220;heard&#8221; of Jerusalem&#8217;s broken walls (<a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3-4</a>). Faithful servants of God listen, assess, and move.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> calls believers to be &#8220;doers of the word, and not hearers only,&#8221; something Johanan now exemplifies.<p>&#8226; Application: Information should never leave us passive; righteous hearing leads to righteous doing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the crimes that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed</b><p>Ishmael&#8217;s murderous rampage (<a href="/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2-10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-25.htm">2 Kings 25:25</a>) included killing the governor, soldiers, and civilians, and abducting hostages. His violence defied God&#8217;s command to submit peacefully to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11-12</a>). The phrase &#8220;all the crimes&#8221; emphasizes the completeness of his guilt, inviting comparison to Cain&#8217;s &#8220;sin lying at the door&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> lists seven things the Lord hates, including &#8220;hands that shed innocent blood,&#8221; which precisely describes Ishmael.<p>&#8226; Application: Sin may appear to succeed briefly, but God swiftly exposes it and raises opposition against it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/41-11.htm">Jeremiah 41:11</a> highlights God&#8217;s faithful remnant hearing about evil and preparing to confront it.
