The fear mentioned here is a reverential awe, recognizing God's majesty and holiness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, kings were often seen as divine or semi-divine figures, but Jeremiah asserts that God is the true King above all. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>, where God is described as "a great King over all the earth." The title "King of nations" suggests that God's rule is not limited to Israel but extends universally, foreshadowing the New Testament revelation of Christ as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>This is Your due.</b><br>The phrase underscores that reverence and worship are rightfully owed to God. It implies that acknowledging God's sovereignty is not just appropriate but obligatory. This aligns with the biblical theme that God deserves worship from all creation, as seen in passages like <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, where the elders declare God's worthiness to receive glory and honor. The concept of giving God His due is rooted in the understanding of His role as Creator and Sustainer of the universe.<p><b>For among all the wise men of the nations,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the contrast between human wisdom and divine wisdom. In the ancient world, wisdom was highly valued, and wise men often served as counselors to kings. However, Jeremiah points out that even the wisest among the nations cannot compare to God. This is reminiscent of <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>, where Paul states that "the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom." The wisdom of the nations often led them to idolatry and false worship, which Jeremiah critiques throughout his ministry.<p><b>and in all their kingdoms,</b><br>The mention of "kingdoms" emphasizes the political and social structures of the time. Each kingdom had its own gods and wise men, yet none could rival the true God. This reflects the historical context of Jeremiah's ministry, during which Judah was surrounded by powerful nations like Babylon and Egypt. Despite their might and wisdom, these kingdoms were ultimately subject to God's will, as demonstrated by the fall of Babylon in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>.<p><b>there is none like You.</b><br>This concluding phrase affirms the uniqueness and incomparability of God. It echoes the monotheistic declaration found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." The assertion that there is none like God is a central theme in the prophetic literature, emphasizing His distinctiveness from idols and false gods. This also points to the uniqueness of Christ, who is the exact representation of God's being (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>), fulfilling the prophetic vision of a God who is unparalleled in power, wisdom, and love.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel.
