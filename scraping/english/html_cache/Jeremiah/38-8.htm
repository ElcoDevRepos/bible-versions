His position as a eunuch suggests he held a significant and trusted role, as eunuchs often served in royal households due to their perceived loyalty and inability to establish a competing dynasty. The mention of the king's palace indicates the setting is in Jerusalem, during a time of great turmoil as the city was under threat from Babylonian forces. This context highlights the courage of Ebed-melech, as he steps out from the safety of the palace to intervene on behalf of Jeremiah, who was imprisoned for his prophecies against the city. His actions reflect a deep sense of justice and compassion, qualities that are commended in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>, which calls for speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves.<p><b>and said to the king</b><br>Approaching the king directly was a bold move, especially for a foreigner and a eunuch, indicating Ebed-melech's bravery and the urgency of his mission. In the hierarchical society of ancient Judah, speaking to the king required not only courage but also a certain level of access and respect, which Ebed-melech evidently possessed. His willingness to speak up for Jeremiah, who was seen as a traitor by many, aligns with the biblical theme of advocating for the oppressed, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>. This act of intercession can also be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity before God. Ebed-melech's intervention ultimately leads to Jeremiah's release, demonstrating the power of righteous advocacy and the importance of standing up for truth and justice, even in the face of potential personal risk.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ebed-melech.htm">Ebed-melech</a></b><br>A Cushite servant in the king's palace who showed courage and

Cushite eunuch, hears that Jeremiah has been thrown into a muddy cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>). Rather than remain silent, he &#8220;went out,&#8221; an intentional step of action.<p>&#8226; His movement signifies personal responsibility; he refuses to be a passive observer while a prophet of God suffers. Compare <a href="/proverbs/31-8.htm">Proverbs 31:8-9</a>, &#8220;Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves&#8230; defend the rights of the poor and needy&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a> echoes the same principle: &#8220;Whoever knows the right thing to do yet fails to do it is guilty of sin&#8221;. Ebed-melech embodies this by leaving his post to intervene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the king&#8217;s palace</b><p>&#8226; The palace represents safety, privilege, and prestige. Leaving it shows that true obedience to God may require stepping away from comfort.<p>&#8226; Esther took a similar risk when she approached her king, &#8220;For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place&#8230; and who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221; (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a> calls believers to &#8220;go to Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore&#8221;. Ebed-melech models this by exiting a secure environment to identify with God&#8217;s persecuted servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said to the king</b><p>&#8226; The verse highlights not only action but also speech. Ebed-melech risks his position by confronting Zedekiah, a monarch often swayed by powerful advisors (<a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Bold speech to authority aligns with Nathan&#8217;s confrontation of David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;7</a> and with the apostles&#8217; resolve: &#8220;We cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; His words (v.9) charge the officials with evil and plead for Jeremiah&#8217;s life&#8212;truth spoken with respect but without compromise. <a href="/proverbs/25-15.htm">Proverbs 25:15</a> notes, &#8220;Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/38-8.htm">Jeremiah 38:8</a> showcases courageous faith in action. Ebed-melech:<p>&#8226; Discerns injustice, leaves comfort, and personally intervenes.<p>&#8226; Demonstrates that godly compassion is never silent or stationary.<p>&#8226; Affirms that respectful but fearless speech to those in power is a vital part of righteousness.<p>The verse invites believers to follow his example&#8212;stepping out of ease, confronting wrong, and advocating for God&#8217;s servants, trusting the Lord to honor such obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/38-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ebed-melech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5663.htm">Strong's 5663: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ebed-melech -- 'servant of a king', an official under King Zedekiah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
