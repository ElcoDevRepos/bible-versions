It reflects the prophetic tradition where God's word is not limited to Israel but is intended for all peoples. This echoes the call in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, where the servant of the Lord is made a light to the nations. It underscores the idea that God's plans and purposes have global implications.<p><b>and proclaim it in distant coastlands:</b><br>The mention of "distant coastlands" suggests the far-reaching impact of God's message, extending beyond the immediate geographical boundaries of Israel. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The coastlands often symbolize the ends of the earth, indicating the inclusivity of God's salvation plan.<p><b>&#8220;The One who scattered Israel</b><br>This refers to God's role in the dispersion of Israel due to their disobedience, as seen in events like the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. It highlights God's sovereignty and justice, as He disciplines His people for their sins. The scattering is a fulfillment of warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, where God promises dispersion as a consequence of covenant unfaithfulness.<p><b>will gather them</b><br>This promise of gathering signifies restoration and hope. It points to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His covenant promises despite Israel's unfaithfulness. This gathering is not just physical but also spiritual, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>, where God promises to gather His people and give them a new heart and spirit. It prefigures the ultimate gathering of God's people in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>.<p><b>and keep them as a shepherd keeps his flock.</b><br>The imagery of God as a shepherd is rich with meaning, conveying care, protection, and guidance. This metaphor is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus identifies Himself as the Good Shepherd. It emphasizes God's intimate relationship with His people and His commitment to their well-being.

God&#8217;s message about Israel is not a private, tribal affair; it is a global proclamation. Isaiah issues a similar summons: &#8220;Come near, you nations, and listen&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/34-1.htm">Isaiah 34:1</a>). The psalmist echoes: &#8220;Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-10.htm">Psalm 46:10</a>). Paul affirms that this worldwide broadcast has already begun: &#8220;Their voice has gone out into all the earth&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>). God wants the whole world to recognize His faithful dealings with Israel so that His character and purposes are clearly seen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and proclaim it in distant coastlands</b><p>The command moves from hearing to heralding. Those who receive the message are instructed to relay it to &#8220;distant coastlands,&#8221; a phrase that pictures the farthest reaches of the known world. Isaiah foretells that the Servant&#8217;s justice will reach &#8220;the coastlands&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>). Jesus extends the same impulse when He says, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), and again in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>: &#8220;to the ends of the earth.&#8221; The scope is unmistakable&#8212;God&#8217;s redemptive plan centers on Israel but is meant to bless every people group who hears and believes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The One who scattered Israel will gather them</b><p>God Himself owns both the scattering and the regathering. Israel&#8217;s exile was not random history; it was God&#8217;s righteous discipline (see <a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3&#8211;4</a> for the promise of return even from &#8220;the farthest heavens&#8221;). Yet the same God pledges to reverse that dispersion. Ezekiel records, &#8220;I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries where you have been scattered&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>). Paul sees this promise culminating when &#8220;all Israel will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>). The exile underscores God&#8217;s holiness, the gathering underscores His mercy, and together they show His unwavering covenant commitment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and keep them as a shepherd keeps his flock</b><p>The imagery shifts to tender care. Scattered sheep need not only retrieval but ongoing protection. David knew this Shepherd: &#8220;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1&#8211;4</a>). Jesus fulfills the picture: &#8220;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). He promises everlasting security: &#8220;No one will snatch them out of My hand&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27&#8211;28</a>). Revelation closes the loop: &#8220;The Lamb&#8230;will shepherd them&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>). God&#8217;s shepherding heart ensures that the gathered nation&#8212;and all who are grafted in by faith&#8212;enjoy guidance, provision, and safety forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a> declares a worldwide announcement: every nation must hear and broadcast that the God who justly scattered Israel will just as certainly regather and shepherd them.

The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (<a href="/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (<a href="/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>)" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hear,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O nations,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1460;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(g&#333;&#183;w&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1471.htm">Strong's 1471: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foreign nation, a Gentile, a troop of animals, a flight of locusts</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and proclaim it</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hag&#183;g&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
