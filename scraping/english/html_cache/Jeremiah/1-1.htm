His writings are a collection of prophecies, narratives, and laments. The phrase indicates the beginning of a prophetic book, similar to other prophetic introductions (e.g., Isaiah, Ezekiel). Jeremiah's role as a prophet was to convey God's messages to the people of Judah, often focusing on themes of judgment and restoration.<p><b>son of Hilkiah</b><br>Hilkiah is identified as Jeremiah's father, suggesting a priestly lineage. This connection is significant as it places Jeremiah within the Levitical tradition, which was responsible for religious duties and temple service. Hilkiah may also be linked to the high priest who found the Book of the Law during King Josiah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>), though this is not definitively confirmed.<p><b>one of the priests in Anathoth</b><br>Anathoth was a Levitical city allocated to the descendants of Aaron, located a few miles northeast of Jerusalem. This setting emphasizes Jeremiah's priestly background, which would have influenced his understanding of religious law and temple practices. The mention of Anathoth also highlights the tension Jeremiah faced, as his messages often opposed the religious establishment.<p><b>in the territory of Benjamin</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and its territory bordered Judah. This geographical detail situates Jeremiah within the southern kingdom, which was the focus of his prophetic ministry. The location is significant as it underscores the political and social context of his prophecies, particularly during the turbulent times leading up to the Babylonian exile. Benjamin's proximity to Jerusalem also meant that Jeremiah was closely connected to the events and leadership in the capital.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
