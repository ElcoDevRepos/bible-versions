The elders speaking in the time of Jehoiakim (cir. B.C. 608) remembered the tradition of what had passed, a century or so before, in the reign of Hezekiah (B.C. 726-698), and could appeal to it as a precedent in favour of the prophet.

The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (<span class="accented">qahal</span>) rendered "assembly" is the traditional legal term for the "congregation of Israel" (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to <span class="accented">qahal</span>. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The "elders" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. "References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>.
