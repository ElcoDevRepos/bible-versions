His warnings of impending judgment and calls for repentance were unpopular, especially as they contradicted the false assurances given by other prophets. This anger from the officials reflects the broader rejection of God's message by the leadership, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah. The officials' anger can be compared to the hostility faced by other prophets, such as Elijah and Amos, who also confronted the leaders of their time.<p><b>and they beat him</b><br>Physical punishment was a common method of silencing dissenters and enforcing authority in ancient times. Jeremiah's beating signifies the severe opposition he faced and the lengths to which the leaders would go to suppress his message. This act of violence against a prophet of God foreshadows the suffering of Jesus Christ, who was also beaten and rejected by the authorities of His day (<a href="/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>).<p><b>and placed him in jail</b><br>Imprisonment was a tactic used to isolate and discredit those who were seen as threats to the established order. Jeremiah's imprisonment highlights the cost of faithfully delivering God's message, regardless of personal consequences. This parallels the experiences of other biblical figures, such as Joseph and Paul, who were also unjustly imprisoned yet remained steadfast in their faith.<p><b>in the house of Jonathan the scribe</b><br>Jonathan's house being used as a jail indicates the lack of formal prison facilities in Jerusalem at the time. Scribes were influential figures, often involved in administrative and governmental duties. The use of a scribe's house for imprisonment suggests the involvement of the educated elite in the persecution of Jeremiah, reflecting a broader societal rejection of his message.<p><b>for it had been made into a prison</b><br>The conversion of a private residence into a prison underscores the desperate measures taken by the authorities to control dissent. This detail illustrates the chaotic and deteriorating state of Judah's society as it faced impending conquest by Babylon. The transformation of ordinary spaces into places of confinement can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual captivity of the nation, which had turned away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

It had not only the subterranean dungeon and pit common to all Eastern prisons, but separate "cabins" or cells (the Hebrew word does not occur elsewhere) for the confinement of individual prisoners (<a href="/jeremiah/37-16.htm" title="When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;">Jeremiah 37:16</a>).

We have fairly adequate data for measuring the duration of the "many days" of his imprisonment. It began before the second siege of Jerusalem, which lasted for nearly two years (<a href="/context/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.">2Kings 25:1-3</a>), and when the city was taken he was still in the court of the prison.

As Graf has pointed out, the princes, who had evinced their respect for Jeremiah on former occasions (ch. 26, 36.) had probably shared the captivity of Jehoiachin; Zedekiah's "princes" would be of a lower origin and type, and ready (like the judges in the French "terror") to accept any charge against an unpopular person without proper examination. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Jonathan the scribe</span>.

Chardin, the old traveller, remarks, "The Eastern prisons are not public buildings erected for that purpose, but a part of the house in which the criminal judges dwell. As the governor and provost of a town, or the captain of the watch, imprison such as are accused in their own houses, they set apart a canton of them for that purpose when they are put into these offices, and choose for the jailor the most proper person they can find of their domestics" (Chardin). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/37-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The officials</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
