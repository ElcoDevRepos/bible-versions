The phrase "word of the LORD" is a common prophetic formula indicating the authority and authenticity of the message. It highlights the concept of divine revelation, which is central to the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament. This divine communication is consistent with other instances where God speaks to His prophets, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>.<p><b>in the days of Jehoiakim</b><br>Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah and reigned as king of Judah from approximately 609 to 598 BC. His reign was marked by political turmoil and shifting allegiances, particularly with the rising power of Babylon. Jehoiakim's reign is significant in biblical history as it was a time of increasing threat from Babylon, leading to the eventual exile. This period is crucial for understanding the context of Jeremiah's prophecies, as they often addressed the impending judgment and call for repentance. The historical context of Jehoiakim's reign is also detailed in <a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36-24</a>:7 and <a href="/2_chronicles/36-5.htm">2 Chronicles 36:5-8</a>.<p><b>son of Josiah</b><br>Josiah was one of the most righteous kings of Judah, known for his religious reforms and efforts to restore the worship of Yahweh, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22-23</a>. His legacy is one of faithfulness to God, contrasting with the subsequent decline under his successors. The mention of Josiah serves as a reminder of the covenant faithfulness expected of Judah, which Jehoiakim failed to uphold. Josiah's reforms and the rediscovery of the Book of the Law are significant events that set the stage for the prophetic messages of Jeremiah.<p><b>king of Judah</b><br>Judah was the southern kingdom, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with Jerusalem as its capital. The kingdom of Judah had a unique covenant relationship with God, which included the Davidic line of kingship. The role of the king was to lead the people in covenant faithfulness, but many kings, including Jehoiakim, failed in this duty. The mention of Judah highlights the specific audience of Jeremiah's prophecies and the impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness. The kingdom's history and its eventual fall to Babylon are central themes in the prophetic literature, including the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.
