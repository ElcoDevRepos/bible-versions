The "place" refers to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, a site associated with idolatry and child sacrifice (<a href="/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>). The plans of Judah and Jerusalem likely refer to their political and military strategies, as well as their religious practices, which were contrary to God's commands. This judgment reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p><b>I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies,</b><br>This part of the prophecy foretells military defeat. Historically, this was fulfilled during the Babylonian invasion when Jerusalem fell in 586 BC. The "sword" symbolizes warfare and divine retribution. The enemies, in this context, are the Babylonians, who were instruments of God's judgment. This echoes earlier warnings given by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>).<p><b>by the hands of those who seek their lives,</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the personal nature of the threat. The Babylonians, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, were actively seeking to conquer and destroy Jerusalem. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations to discipline His people, as seen in the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>).<p><b>and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.</b><br>This imagery is a common biblical motif for disgrace and dishonor in death (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>). It signifies a complete and utter defeat, where the dead are left unburied, a fate considered shameful in ancient Near Eastern cultures.

Such a play upon the sound and sense of words is quite in accordance with the genius of Hebrew prophecy, but it is obviously in most cases impossible to reproduce it in another language. The primary meaning is "to pour out, to spill," and so "to waste, <span class= "ital">or </span>bring to nought." (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/19-3.htm" title="And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.">Isaiah 19:3</a>.) Some interpreters have supposed that the words were accompanied by corresponding acts, and that the earthen bottle, which the prophet had brought filled with water, was now emptied in the sight of the people, with a symbolism like that of <a href="/1_samuel/7-6.htm" title="And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.">1Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/14-14.htm" title="For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again;
