It is a common introduction in prophetic literature, indicating that the message is not from the prophet himself but from God.<p><b>Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine:</b><br>The imagery of gleaning refers to the practice of collecting leftover crops after the main harvest, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>. Here, it symbolizes a thorough judgment or purification process. The "remnant of Israel" suggests those who remain after a period of judgment or calamity, a recurring theme in prophetic books. This remnant is often seen as a group preserved by God for future restoration, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>.<p><b>Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches:</b><br>This phrase continues the metaphor of harvesting, indicating a repeated and meticulous process. The grape gatherer ensures that no fruit is left behind, symbolizing the completeness of God's judgment. This thoroughness can be seen as a call for repentance and a warning of the consequences of continued disobedience. The imagery of the vine and branches is also reminiscent of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>, where He describes Himself as the true vine and His followers as the branches, emphasizing the need for connection to Him for spiritual life and fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

Whatever follows is not a suggestion but a decree, just as earlier in Jeremiah the same title announced imminent judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>).<p>- The opening assures us that the message comes directly from the living God, reaffirming the certainty and reliability of what Jeremiah is about to deliver (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine</b><p>- &#8220;Glean&#8221; usually describes picking leftover grapes after the main harvest (<a href="/leviticus/19-10.htm">Leviticus 19:10</a>). Here God commands a complete, second sweep&#8212;nothing is to be left.<p>- The &#8220;remnant of Israel&#8221; had trusted that their small size would spare them; yet God declares that even those fragments still clinging to the vine will face purifying judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/24-8.htm">Jeremiah 24:8-10</a>).<p>- Vines often symbolize Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-11</a>). When the vine refuses to yield good fruit, the owner must remove what remains. This image underscores both God&#8217;s patience&#8212;He delayed until only gleanings were left&#8212;and His thoroughness&#8212;He will not overlook persistent rebellion.<p>- The thorough gleaning parallels earlier warnings that no corner of the land would escape (<a href="/jeremiah/6-12.htm">Jeremiah 6:12</a>; <a href="/amos/5-3.htm">Amos 5:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the branches</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;once more&#8221; intensifies the picture: after the first harvest and the first gleaning, a final hand runs over the branches to strip every remaining grape.<p>- God instructs His agents&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s armies then, future judgment ultimately&#8212;to make a last, meticulous sweep (<a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12-15</a>).<p>- This closing action highlights two truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is exhaustive; nothing hidden stays hidden (<a href="/habakkuk/2-8.htm">Habakkuk 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose in judgment is corrective, aiming to remove what is rotten so that genuine fruit can grow later (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>).<p>- The picture also foreshadows the New Testament warning that branches without fruit are cut off and burned (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2, 6</a>), showing continuity in God&#8217;s dealings with His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a> portrays God&#8217;s decisive, all-encompassing judgment on a rebellious nation. Speaking as the sovereign LORD of Hosts, He orders a meticulous harvest image: every last grape on the vine of Israel must be swept away. The remnant cannot presume upon His mercy while persisting in sin. Yet even this severe gleaning serves a redemptive end&#8212;removing corruption so that, in His time, a purified remnant may bear true fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Turn back thine hand.</span>--The image of the grape-gatherer carrying on his work to the last grape or tendril was a natural parable of unsparing desolation. The command is addressed to the minister of destruction, Nebuchadnezzar, or, it may be, to the angel of death.<p><span class= "bld">Into the baskets.</span>--The noun is found here only, and probably means, like a kindred word in <a href="/isaiah/18-5.htm" title="For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.">Isaiah 18:5</a>, <span class= "ital">the tendrils of the vine </span>upon which the hand of the gatherer was to be turned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-15.</span> - It is an all but complete Judgment, which Jehovah foreshows.

Even Judah shall undergo a severe sifting process, which is likened to a gleaning (comp. <a href="/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>).

If the text is correct, the speaker here addresses the leader of the gleaners. Keil thinks this change of construction is to emphasize the certainty of the predicted destruction. But it is much more natural (and in perfect harmony with many other similar phenomena of the received text) to suppose, with Hitzig, that the letter represented in the Authorized Version By "thine" has arisen by a mistaken repetition of the first letter of the following word, and (the verbal form being the same for the infinitive and the imperative) to render <span class="accented">turning again the hand</span>. In this case the clause will be dependent on the preceding statement as to the "gleaning" of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">Into the baskets</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the shoots</span>.
