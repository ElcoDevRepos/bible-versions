This metaphor indicates the seriousness of his prophetic role. In ancient times, ore was tested to determine its purity and value, reflecting the spiritual examination God requires of His people. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God tests the hearts of His people, such as in <a href="/psalms/26-2.htm">Psalm 26:2</a> and <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God is described as a refiner and purifier. The appointment signifies God's sovereign choice and authority over Jeremiah's mission, emphasizing the prophet's role in discerning the true spiritual state of Israel.<p><b>so you may know and try their ways</b><br>The purpose of Jeremiah's examination is to gain understanding and discernment of the people's conduct and character. "Know" implies a deep, intimate understanding, while "try" suggests testing or proving, akin to refining metals. This reflects the biblical theme of God knowing the hearts of individuals, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> and <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12-13</a>. The phrase underscores the importance of not just outward religious observance but the inner moral and spiritual condition. The people's "ways" refer to their behaviors, choices, and lifestyle, which are to be scrutinized against God's standards. This examination is not merely for judgment but also for the possibility of repentance and restoration, aligning with the broader prophetic call to return to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The following rendering is given on the authority of the most recent commentators, and has the merit of being in harmony with the metallurgic imagery of the following verses. <span class= "ital">As a prover of ore I have set thee among my people, and thou shalt know and try their way. </span>The words are spoken by Jehovah to the prophet, and describe his work. By others, the first part of the sentence is rendered as follows: <span class= "ital">As a prover of ore I have set thee like a fortress, </span>as if with a reference to <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm" title="For, behold, I have made you this day a defended city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, where the same word is used.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set thee</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">as an assayer have I set thee among my people</span>, <span class="accented">a fortress</span>. Various attempts have been made to avoid giving the last word its natural rendering, "a fortress." Ewald, for instance, would alter the points, and render "a separator [of metals]," thus making the word synonymous with that translated "an assayer;" but this is against Hebrew usage. Hitzig, assuming a doubtful interpretation of <a href="/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, renders "... among my people without gold," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "without there being any gold there for thee to essay" (a very awkward form of expression). These are the two most plausible views, and yet neither of them is satisfactory. Nothing remains but the very simple conjecture, supported by not a few similar phenomena, that <span class="accented">mibhcar</span>, a fortress, has been inserted by mistake from the margin, where an early glossator had written the word, to remind of the parallel passage (<a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, "I have made thee this day a fortress-city," '<span class="accented">it mibhcar</span>). In this and the following verses metallurgic phraseology is employed with a moral application (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 25</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I have appointed you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular &#124;
