The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His active role in guiding and correcting His people.<p><b>&#8220;I am against those who prophesy false dreams</b><br>False prophets were a significant issue in ancient Israel, often leading the people away from God's truth. Dreams were a common means of divine communication (e.g., Joseph in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>), but false prophets exploited this by claiming divine revelation through dreams that were not from God. This phrase highlights God's opposition to those who misuse spiritual gifts for deception.<p><b>and retell them to lead My people astray</b><br>The act of retelling false dreams indicates a deliberate effort to mislead. The phrase "lead My people astray" reflects the serious consequences of false prophecy, which can result in spiritual and moral decline. This echoes the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> about false prophets leading people away from God.<p><b>with their reckless lies.</b><br>The term "reckless" suggests a lack of concern for the truth or the well-being of others. Lies, especially in a spiritual context, are dangerous and destructive. This phrase underscores the irresponsibility and danger of false prophecy, aligning with the broader biblical condemnation of deceit (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>).<p><b>It was not I who sent them or commanded them,</b><br>This statement clarifies that these false prophets do not have divine authority. Throughout the Bible, true prophets are those sent and commanded by God (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>). This phrase serves as a litmus test for discerning true from false prophecy, emphasizing the importance of divine commissioning.<p><b>and they are of no benefit at all to these people,&#8221;</b><br>False prophets offer no true spiritual benefit; instead, they bring harm. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15-20</a> about recognizing false prophets by their fruits. The lack of benefit contrasts with the true prophets, who guide, correct, and edify God's people.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The repetition of "declares the LORD" bookends the passage, reinforcing the divine authority and seriousness of the message. It serves as a reminder that the ultimate accountability is to God, who sees and judges all actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals claiming to speak on behalf of God but who are actually delivering false messages and dreams.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God is delivering this message, known for his warnings against false prophets and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The audience being misled by the false prophets, whom God desires to protect and guide.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_dreams.htm">False Dreams</a></b><br>The deceptive messages and visions claimed by the false prophets, which are not from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_is_essential.htm">Discernment is Essential</a></b><br>Believers must be vigilant and discerning, testing all teachings and prophecies against the truth of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_authority.htm">God's Authority</a></b><br>Only those truly sent by God have the authority to speak on His behalf.
