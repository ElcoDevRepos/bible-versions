The call to mourn reflects the cultural practice of communal grieving, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. Moab, often in conflict with Israel, is now facing divine judgment. The surrounding nations, likely including those who had alliances or trade relations with Moab, are urged to mourn, indicating the widespread impact of Moab's downfall. This mourning can be seen as a recognition of God's sovereignty over all nations, not just Israel.<p><b>everyone who knows his name</b><br>Knowing a name in biblical terms often implies a deeper understanding or relationship. Here, it suggests that those familiar with Moab's reputation or history should lament its fate. Moab was known for its pride and idolatry, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/16.htm">Isaiah 16</a> and <a href="/amos/2.htm">Amos 2</a>. The call to mourn by those who know Moab's name underscores the loss of a once-prominent nation and serves as a warning to others about the consequences of pride and rebellion against God.<p><b>tell how the mighty scepter is shattered</b><br>The scepter symbolizes authority and power, often associated with kingship. Moab's scepter being shattered signifies the end of its political power and influence. This imagery is consistent with biblical prophecies where God humbles the proud and powerful, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>. The shattering of the scepter is a fulfillment of divine judgment, illustrating that no earthly power can withstand God's will.<p><b>the glorious staff!</b><br>The staff, like the scepter, represents leadership and strength. Describing it as "glorious" highlights Moab's former prestige and the respect it commanded. The destruction of this staff indicates a complete loss of glory and honor. This serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human glory compared to the eternal glory of God. The imagery of a broken staff can also be seen as a type pointing to Christ, the true Shepherd, whose reign is unbreakable and eternal, contrasting with the temporary and fragile power of earthly rulers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.
