Historically, Elam was a significant power, often interacting with Mesopotamian civilizations. The prophecy against Elam signifies God's judgment on nations that opposed Israel. The term "shatter" indicates a complete and decisive defeat, suggesting that Elam's military and political power would be broken. This reflects God's sovereignty over all nations, not just Israel, and His ability to use other nations as instruments of His judgment.<p><b>before those who seek their lives</b><br>This phrase highlights the presence of enemies actively pursuing Elam. Historically, Elam had numerous conflicts with neighboring powers, including Assyria and Babylon. The prophecy suggests that these adversaries would be successful in their campaigns against Elam, fulfilling God's judgment. It underscores the theme of divine retribution where God uses the ambitions of other nations to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>I will bring disaster upon them</b><br>The disaster mentioned is a direct result of God's judgment. In the biblical context, disaster often comes as a consequence of sin and rebellion against God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine justice, where nations and individuals face consequences for their actions. The disaster is not random but a purposeful act of God to bring about His will.<p><b>even My fierce anger,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>God's fierce anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often associated with His response to sin and idolatry. This phrase emphasizes the intensity of God's wrath against Elam, indicating that their actions have provoked a strong divine response. It serves as a warning to other nations and individuals about the seriousness of incurring God's anger.<p><b>I will send out the sword after them</b><br>The sword is a common biblical symbol for war and destruction. This phrase suggests that Elam would face ongoing military defeat and turmoil. The imagery of the sword pursuing them indicates relentless judgment, where there is no escape from the consequences of their actions. It reflects the idea that God's judgment is thorough and inescapable.<p><b>until I finish them off</b><br>This phrase indicates the completeness of God's judgment. The idea of being "finished off" suggests total destruction or subjugation, leaving no room for recovery. It underscores the finality of divine judgment when God decides to act against a nation. This serves as a sobering reminder of the ultimate authority and power of God over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elam.htm">Elam</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located in what is now southwestern Iran.
