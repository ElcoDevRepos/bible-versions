In ancient Near Eastern culture, scarecrows were used to deter birds and pests from crops, much like today. The comparison highlights the lifelessness and impotence of idols, which are as ineffective as scarecrows in providing any real protection or benefit. This imagery underscores the futility of idol worship, contrasting the living God with man-made objects.<p><b>Their idols cannot speak</b><br>The inability of idols to speak emphasizes their lack of divinity and power. In biblical times, communication was a key attribute of deity, as seen in the God of Israel who speaks to His people through prophets and scripture. This phrase contrasts the living God, who actively communicates, with mute idols, reinforcing the message that idols are powerless and unworthy of worship.<p><b>They must be carried because they cannot walk</b><br>This highlights the dependency and helplessness of idols. Unlike the God of Israel, who is omnipresent and active, idols require human effort to be moved or positioned. This dependency is a stark reminder of their lack of life and power. The imagery also recalls the Ark of the Covenant, which was carried by the Israelites, yet represented the presence of a living, active God who led and protected His people.<p><b>Do not fear them</b><br>The command not to fear idols reassures the faithful of their impotence. In the ancient world, fear of deities was common, as people believed they could influence events and outcomes. This phrase encourages trust in the one true God, who alone is sovereign and worthy of reverence. It echoes the biblical theme of fearing God rather than man-made objects or false gods.<p><b>For they can do no harm</b><br>This statement further diminishes the perceived power of idols, asserting their inability to cause any real damage. In contrast to the living God, who has the power to judge and save, idols are impotent. This assurance would have been comforting to the Israelites, who were surrounded by nations practicing idolatry and attributing power to their gods.<p><b>And neither can they do any good</b><br>The final phrase completes the argument against idol worship by stating that idols are not only harmless but also incapable of providing any benefit. This reinforces the futility of relying on them for help or blessing. The living God, in contrast, is the source of all good and the provider for His people, as seen throughout scripture in His acts of deliverance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often warned by prophets like Jeremiah about their idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Man-made objects of worship, often representing false gods, which were prevalent in the cultures surrounding Israel and Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cucumber_patch.htm">Cucumber Patch</a></b><br>A metaphorical setting used by Jeremiah to illustrate the futility and lifelessness of idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/scarecrows.htm">Scarecrows</a></b><br>Used as a metaphor to describe the impotence and lifelessness of idols, emphasizing their inability to act or speak.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols are powerless and cannot affect our lives positively or negatively.

The comparison, in the so-called "Epistle of Jeremy" in the apocryphal book of Baruch (10:70), of an idol to "a scarecrow in a garden of cucumbers" shows that the latter meaning was the accepted one when that Epistle was written. The thought, on this view, is that the idol which the men of Judah were worshipping was like one of the "pillars" (so the word for "palm tree" is translated in <a href="/songs/3-6.htm" title="Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>; <a href="/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.">Joel 2:30</a>), the Hermes, or Priapus-figures which were placed by Greeks and Romans in gardens and orchards as scarecrows.
