The "place" refers to Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish identity and worship. The context is God's response to the idolatry and disobedience of the people. The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. This echoes other prophetic declarations where God announces judgment due to covenant unfaithfulness, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24-25</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/5-8.htm">Ezekiel 5:8-9</a>.<p><b>I will make this city like Topheth.</b><br>Topheth was a location in the Valley of Hinnom, south of Jerusalem, associated with child sacrifice to the god Molech (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>). It became a symbol of judgment and destruction. By comparing Jerusalem to Topheth, God is warning of severe consequences, turning the city into a place of desolation and horror. This imagery is also a precursor to the concept of Gehenna, a term used in the New Testament to describe hell (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-48</a>).

The action is personal; the Lord Himself intervenes, echoing His earlier charge in <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a> to &#8220;tear down and destroy&#8221; before He can &#8220;build and plant.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is both accurate and literal, the promised judgment will unfold in real history, just as the Babylonian siege did in 586 BC (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to this place and to its residents</b><p>The target is specific: Jerusalem and those living there.<p>&#8226;

the words originate with the Sovereign Lord.<p>&#8226; Because He cannot lie (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>), the coming judgment is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make this city like Topheth</b><p>Topheth, in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom south of Jerusalem, was notorious for child sacrifice to Molech (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>).<p>&#8226;
