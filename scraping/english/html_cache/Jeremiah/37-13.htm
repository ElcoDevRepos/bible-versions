This gate likely served as a northern exit from the city, leading towards the land of Benjamin. In the context of Jeremiah, this gate was a strategic point during the Babylonian siege, as it was a place where people could potentially leave the city. The mention of this gate highlights the dire situation in Jerusalem, as people were attempting to flee the city due to the Babylonian threat.<p><b>the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah</b><br>Irijah, the captain of the guard, represents the authority of the Judean military during the Babylonian siege. His lineage is noted, connecting him to Shelemiah and Hananiah, which may indicate a family of some standing or previous service. The mention of his name and lineage underscores the personal nature of the accusation against Jeremiah, as it was not just a random soldier but a person of authority and recognition who confronted him. This reflects the tension and suspicion within Jerusalem during the siege.<p><b>seized him and said,</b><br>The act of seizing Jeremiah indicates the seriousness of the accusation and the authority Irijah wielded. This moment captures the heightened state of alert and paranoia in Jerusalem, where movements were closely monitored, and any perceived threat was swiftly addressed. Jeremiah's seizure is a pivotal moment, reflecting the broader theme of persecution faced by prophets who spoke God's truth in difficult times.<p><b>&#8220;You are deserting to the Chaldeans!&#8221;</b><br>The accusation of desertion to the Chaldeans (Babylonians) was a grave charge, as it implied treason against Judah. The Chaldeans were the dominant power besieging Jerusalem, and any association with them was seen as betrayal. This accusation against Jeremiah is ironic, given his prophetic message that surrender to Babylon was God's will for the preservation of the people. The charge reflects the misunderstanding and rejection of Jeremiah's prophetic role, as well as the broader theme of conflict between divine instruction and human political agendas. This moment foreshadows the suffering and trials Jeremiah would endure for his faithfulness to God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.

The officer in command, Irijah, the son of Shelemiah (probably, therefore, the brother of Jehucal, who is named in <a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.">Jeremiah 37:3</a>, and so probably acquainted with Jeremiah's last prophetic utterance), charged him with treachery. He was "falling away to the Chaldaeans." It was assumed that, though the Chaldaeans had gone, the prophet was about to make his way to their encampment to incite them to return, and so work out the fulfilment of his own prediction. The very phrase "thou fallest away" may have been an allusive reference to Jeremiah's own words in <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm" title="He that stays in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goes out, and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey.">Jeremiah 21:9</a>, if, with the best critics, we refer those words to an earlier date than the raising of the siege.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gate of Benjamin;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gate looking northwards towards Benjamin (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>; <a href="/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>).
