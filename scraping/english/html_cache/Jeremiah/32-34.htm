The term "abominations" often denotes idol worship and practices that are morally and spiritually repugnant. In the context of ancient Israel, this included the worship of foreign gods such as Baal and Asherah, which were common among the surrounding nations. The placement of these idols within the temple precincts was a direct violation of the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and a profound act of rebellion against God.<p><b>in the house that bears My Name</b><br>The "house" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was the central place of worship for the Israelites and symbolized God's presence among His people. The temple was built by Solomon and was meant to be a holy place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh alone (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). The phrase "bears My Name" signifies ownership and divine presence, indicating that the temple was set apart for God's purposes. The desecration of the temple by placing idols within it was not only a religious offense but also a national disgrace, as it undermined the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and so have defiled it</b><br>To "defile" means to make unclean or impure, particularly in a ritualistic or moral sense. The defilement of the temple was a serious transgression because it corrupted the sanctity of the place where God chose to dwell among His people (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>). This act of defilement was a reflection of the broader spiritual apostasy of the nation, which ultimately led to God's judgment and the Babylonian exile. The defilement of the temple can also be seen as a type of the ultimate cleansing that Jesus Christ would bring, as He is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>) and the one who purifies and restores the relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Just as Adam &#8220;took&#8221; the fruit (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>), Judah deliberately set evil where it did not belong.<p>- The verb shows ongoing rebellion, echoing earlier prophetic indictments: &#8220;You set your heart on your own gain&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their abominations</b><p>- &#8220;Abominations&#8221; points to idolatrous objects and practices God detests (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>).<p>- What qualifies as an abomination?

Paul later draws on this concept when warning that believers, now God&#8217;s temple, must not unite with idols (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so have defiled it</b><p>- Defilement is the inevitable result when the holy mixes with the profane (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24&#8211;30</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s response to defilement is judgment, yet always with a redemptive aim&#8212;He will cleanse and restore (<a href="/jeremiah/33-8.htm">Jeremiah 33:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>).<p>- The principle carries forward: any worship space&#8212;or heart&#8212;set apart for God cannot host competing loyalties (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a> exposes deliberate, idolatrous intrusion into God&#8217;s sacred territory. Judah knowingly installed detestable idols within the very temple bearing God&#8217;s Name, turning worship into provocation. The verse warns that conscious sin, especially in places devoted to the LORD, inevitably brings defilement and judgment.
