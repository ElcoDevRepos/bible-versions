This practice is seen in various parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>, where David refuses to eat after the death of Abner. The absence of food offerings signifies a break from traditional mourning practices, highlighting the severity of God's judgment. This phrase indicates a time of such calamity that normal social and religious customs are disrupted. It reflects the depth of desolation and divine displeasure, as the community is unable to engage in acts of compassion and support.<p><b>not even a cup of consolation will be given</b><br>The "cup of consolation" refers to a drink offered to comfort mourners, a practice rooted in the culture of the time. This phrase emphasizes the total absence of comfort and support, symbolizing the complete withdrawal of God's favor and the community's inability to provide solace. The withholding of this cup underscores the profound nature of the judgment, as even basic acts of kindness and empathy are absent. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate judgment and separation from God, where comfort is no longer available.<p><b>for the loss of a father or mother.</b><br>The mention of "father or mother" highlights the personal and familial impact of the judgment. In a patriarchal society, the loss of parents was particularly devastating, affecting inheritance, social standing, and emotional stability. This phrase underscores the depth of the calamity, as it strikes at the heart of family structures and personal relationships. The loss of parental figures can also be seen as a metaphor for the loss of guidance and protection, reflecting Israel's spiritual state as they turn away from God, their ultimate Father. This connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a parent to His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

The verse drives home both the literal certainty of God&#8217;s justice and the urgency of staying near the only true source of consolation&#8212;the LORD Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Neither shall men tear themselves.</span>--The marginal reading, "Neither shall men <span class= "ital">break bread for them,</span>" as in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm" title="Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are cast out to your house? when you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you hide not yourself from your own flesh?">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-4.htm" title="The tongue of the sucking child sticks to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.">Lamentations 4:4</a>, gives the true meaning. We are entering upon another region of funeral customs, reminding us of some of the practices connected with the "wakes" of old English life. After the first burst of sorrow and of fasting, as the sign of sorrow (<a href="/2_samuel/1-12.htm" title="And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.">2Samuel 1:12</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-35.htm" title="And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.">2Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16-17</a>), friends came to the mourner to comfort him. A feast was prepared for them, consisting of "the bread of mourners" (<a href="/hosea/9-4.htm" title="They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing to him: their sacrifices shall be to them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.">Hosea 9:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm" title="Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.">Ezekiel 24:17</a>) and the "cup of consolation," as for those of a heavy heart (<a href="/proverbs/31-6.htm" title="Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts.">Proverbs 31:6</a>). It is probable that some reference to this practice was implied in our Lord's solemn benediction of the bread and of the cup at the Last Supper. As His body had been "anointed for the burial" (<a href="/matthew/26-12.htm" title="For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.">Matthew 26:12</a>), so, in giving the symbols of His death, He was, as it were, keeping with His disciples His own funeral feast. The thought of the dead lying unburied, or buried without honour, is contemplated in all its horrors. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tear themselves for them</span>. The verb is used in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> of breaking bread (the accusative is there expressed), and there is no doubt that this is the meaning here. The only question is whether <span class="accented">lahem</span>, for them, should not rather be <span class="accented">lekhem</span>, bread (this was read by the Septuagint, Peshito, Vulgate, Targnm). St. Jerome sees here an allusion to the funeral feasts (comp. the <span class="accented">parentalia</span>), and surely he is right. The Jews had a conception of the nature of the life of the other world only less distinct than that of their Egyptian neighbors. The funeral feast was not merely for the living, but for the dead. Indeed, it was primarily intended for the spiritual nourish-merit of those who had gone before to the unseen world (comp. Bonwick, 'Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought,' p. 48). Chardin, the old traveler, asserts that "the Oriental Christians still make banquets of this kind by a custom derived from the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The cup of consolation</span>. It would seem as if the funeral feasts had dwindled among the Jews into little more than a refection for the benefit of the mourners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
