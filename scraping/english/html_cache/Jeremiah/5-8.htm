In ancient Near Eastern culture, horses were symbols of strength and virility, often associated with military power and wealth. The term "well-fed" suggests abundance and prosperity, yet it also implies excess and moral decay. This imagery is consistent with the broader biblical theme of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a>, where Israel is compared to a stubborn heifer. The metaphor highlights the people's pursuit of physical desires over spiritual fidelity.<p><b>each neighing after his neighbor&#8217;s wife</b><br>This phrase underscores the rampant adultery and moral corruption among the people. The act of "neighing" is a vivid depiction of uncontrolled lust and desire, akin to the behavior of animals. In the context of the covenant community, adultery was not only a personal sin but also a violation of the covenant with God, as marriage was a sacred institution. This behavior reflects a broader pattern of infidelity to God, paralleling the spiritual adultery of idolatry. The commandment against coveting a neighbor's wife (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>) is directly violated here, illustrating the people's disregard for God's law. This imagery also foreshadows the New Testament teachings of Jesus, who equates lustful intent with adultery in the heart (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>), emphasizing the importance of inner purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
