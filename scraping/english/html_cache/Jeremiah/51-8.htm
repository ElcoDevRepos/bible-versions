Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire, known for its grandeur and influence. The suddenness of its fall is emphasized, reflecting the divine judgment pronounced by God. This mirrors the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets, such as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a>) and Daniel (<a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30-31</a>), who foretold Babylon's destruction. The imagery of being "shattered" suggests complete and irreversible ruin, symbolizing God's ultimate authority over nations.<p><b>Wail for her;</b><br>The call to "wail" indicates a deep mourning and lamentation over Babylon's destruction. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, wailing was a common expression of grief and loss. This mourning could be seen as both a literal and metaphorical response, reflecting the sorrow of those who relied on Babylon's power and wealth. It also serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and idolatry.<p><b>Get her balm for her pain;</b><br>The mention of "balm" refers to a healing ointment, often associated with the region of Gilead (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). This suggests an attempt to find a remedy for Babylon's suffering. However, the futility of this effort is implied, as no earthly solution can heal the divine judgment inflicted upon Babylon. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual condition of nations and individuals who turn away from God.<p><b>Perhaps she can be healed.</b><br>The use of "perhaps" indicates uncertainty and doubt about the possibility of Babylon's recovery. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true healing and restoration come only through repentance and turning to God. The rhetorical nature of this statement underscores the inevitability of Babylon's fate, as prophesied by Jeremiah. It serves as a reminder of the limitations of human efforts in the face of divine will and the need for reliance on God's mercy and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant empire in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God's people.

Here the weeping is not intercession but acknowledgment that what God has spoken stands fulfilled (<a href="/jeremiah/15-5.htm">Jeremiah 15:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Even enemies grieve when a once-mighty empire disintegrates, just as merchants lamented Rome-like Babylon in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-11</a>.<p>&#8226; The wail underscores that sin&#8217;s fallout spreads beyond the guilty, touching economies, alliances, and ordinary lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get her balm for her pain</b><p>Jeremiah shifts to the language of medicine: &#8220;Get her balm for her pain.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gilead&#8217;s balm was famous (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>), yet no earthly remedy can heal a judgment decreed by God.<p>&#8226; This line exposes human attempts to patch spiritual wounds with political alliances, wealth, or strategy&#8212;efforts Isaiah likened to leaning on a broken reed (<a href="/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reminds us that true healing is always and only from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>), never from the idols Babylon cherished (<a href="/jeremiah/51-44.htm">Jeremiah 51:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Perhaps she can be healed</b><p>The phrase sounds hopeful but is really rhetorical. Earlier the prophet declared, &#8220;We tried to heal Babylon, but she could not be healed&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-9.htm">Jeremiah 51:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience had long been extended (<a href="/jeremiah/15-6.htm">Jeremiah 15:6</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Persistent rebellion closed the door on reprieve.<p>&#8226; The conditional &#8220;perhaps&#8221; exposes Babylon&#8217;s self-deception: she presumed her power ensured safety (<a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>), yet refusal to repent made healing impossible.<p>&#8226; This serves as solemn warning: nations and individuals alike must seek the Lord while He may be found (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>), for there comes a moment when judgment is irreversible (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a> announces the sudden, irrevocable fall of Babylon, calls on witnesses to mourn, highlights the futility of man-made remedies, and underscores that without repentance even the greatest empire is beyond healing.

The Hebrew, more forcibly, has "is broken." The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the "breach" of God's people is constantly referred to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howl for her</span>.
