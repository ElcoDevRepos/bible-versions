Baal was a prominent Canaanite god associated with fertility and storms. The Israelites' construction of these sites indicates a departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This idolatry was a recurring issue throughout Israel's history, leading to divine judgment.<p><b>in the Valley of Ben-hinnom</b><br>The Valley of Ben-hinnom, located southwest of Jerusalem, became infamous for idolatrous practices, including child sacrifice. It later became associated with Gehenna, a term used in the New Testament to describe hell (<a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>). The valley's history as a place of abomination underscores the severity of Judah's sin.<p><b>to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire to Molech</b><br>This phrase refers to the practice of child sacrifice, a detestable act condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21 and 20</a>:2-5. Molech was a god worshiped by the Ammonites, and the Israelites' participation in such rituals represented a profound moral and spiritual decline. The act of sacrificing children was not only a violation of God's law but also a perversion of the sanctity of life.<p><b>something I never commanded them</b><br>God's laws, as given through Moses, explicitly forbade such practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). This phrase emphasizes that these actions were not only unauthorized but also contrary to God's character and will. It highlights the Israelites' disobedience and the distortion of true worship.<p><b>nor had it ever entered My mind</b><br>This expression indicates the utter foreignness of such practices to God's nature. It underscores the gravity of Judah's sin, as they engaged in acts that were completely antithetical to God's intentions for His people. It also serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the expectations He has for His covenant people.<p><b>that they should commit such an abomination</b><br>The term "abomination" is used in Scripture to describe actions that are detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). This highlights the severity of the sin and the deep offense it caused to God. The use of this term underscores the need for repentance and divine judgment.<p><b>and cause Judah to sin</b><br>The leaders and people of Judah were responsible for leading the nation into sin, affecting not only their relationship with God but also their societal integrity. This phrase indicates the communal nature of sin and its consequences, as seen in the eventual Babylonian exile. It serves as a warning of the dangers of turning away from God's commandments and the impact of leadership on a nation's spiritual health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah during a time of great apostasy and impending judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity often associated with fertility and weather, whose worship was characterized by idolatry and immorality, and was strictly forbidden by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_hinnom.htm">Valley of Hinnom</a></b><br>A location near Jerusalem notorious for idolatrous practices, including child sacrifice, which later became synonymous with judgment and hell (Gehenna).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/molech.htm">Molech</a></b><br>A pagan god to whom the Israelites, in their apostasy, sacrificed their children, an act that was abhorrent to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which fell into idolatry and was warned by prophets like Jeremiah of the consequences of their sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_life.htm">The Sanctity of Life</a></b><br>God values human life and abhors practices that devalue it, such as child sacrifice.
