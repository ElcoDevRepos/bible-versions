In ancient metallurgy, bellows were used to increase the heat of the fire, symbolizing God's judgment and purification process. The imagery suggests a relentless attempt to purify the people of Judah, reflecting God's desire for their repentance and transformation. This can be compared to the refining process described in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God is portrayed as a refiner and purifier of silver.<p><b>Blasting away the lead with fire</b><br>Lead was often used in ancient refining processes to separate impurities from precious metals. Here, it symbolizes the impurities within the people of Judah. The fire represents God's judgment, intended to remove sin and corruption. This imagery is consistent with the biblical theme of purification through fire, as seen in passages like <a href="/zechariah/13-9.htm">Zechariah 13:9</a>, where God refines His people as one refines silver.<p><b>The refining proceeds in vain</b><br>Despite the intense efforts to purify, the process is unsuccessful. This highlights the stubbornness and unrepentant nature of the people. It serves as a warning about the futility of external religious rituals without genuine repentance and transformation of the heart. This theme is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>, where God criticizes the people for their superficial worship and lack of true righteousness.<p><b>For the wicked are not purged</b><br>The failure to remove wickedness underscores the depth of Judah's spiritual corruption. Despite God's efforts, the people's hearts remain hardened. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of human sinfulness and the need for divine intervention. It points to the ultimate solution found in Jesus Christ, who purifies believers through His sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>, where Christ's blood cleanses our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate "are scorched" (on the authority of <a href="/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>), and attach the word rendered "of the fire" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: "The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading <span class="accented">tammah</span>). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the <span class="accented">nun</span> be radical) the sense of "snorting," which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (<a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>). The masculine form of the verb rendered "is consumed" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of <span class="accented">tittom</span> was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: "The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire." In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, <span class="cmt_word">Plucked away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">separated</span>, like the dross from the silver. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The bellows</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1467;&#1428;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(map&#183;pu&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4647.htm">Strong's 4647: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bellows, of a, forge</span><br /><br /><span class="word">blow fiercely,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2787.htm">Strong's 2787: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be hot or scorched, to burn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">blasting away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(tam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_800.htm">Strong's 800: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the lead [with fire].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1508;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5777.htm">Strong's 5777: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lead (a metal)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">The refining [proceeds]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;rap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6884.htm">Strong's 6884: </a> </span><span class="str2">To smelt, refine, test</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in vain,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
