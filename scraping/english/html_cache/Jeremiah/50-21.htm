This phrase indicates a divine command for judgment against Babylon, a nation that had been used by God to discipline Israel but had itself become exceedingly wicked. The call to "go up" suggests a military campaign, reflecting the historical context of ancient warfare where nations often ascended to attack fortified cities.<p><b>and against the residents of Pekod</b><br>Pekod is a region or tribe associated with Babylon, mentioned in other biblical texts as a target of divine judgment. The name means "visitation" or "punishment," reinforcing the theme of divine retribution. This highlights the specificity of God's judgment, targeting not just the land but its inhabitants, who are complicit in Babylon's sins. The mention of Pekod connects to other prophecies against Babylon, such as those in Isaiah and Ezekiel, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of God's justice.<p><b>Kill them and devote them to destruction</b><br>This phrase reflects the concept of herem, a term used in the Old Testament for the complete destruction of a people or city as an act of divine judgment. It underscores the severity of God's wrath against sin and the totality of the judgment decreed. This mirrors the instructions given to Israel in the conquest of Canaan, where certain cities were devoted to destruction to purify the land from idolatry and wickedness. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent rebellion against God.<p><b>Do all that I have commanded you,&#8221; declares the LORD</b><br>This command emphasizes obedience to God's directives, highlighting the role of the prophet or the agent of judgment as an instrument of divine will. It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His purposes through human history. The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the authority and certainty of the prophecy, assuring that what God has spoken will come to pass. This connects to the broader narrative of Scripture, where God's commands are to be followed precisely, as seen in the lives of figures like Moses and Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.

In the flow of chapters 50&#8211;51, the prophet is announcing Babylon&#8217;s downfall.<p>&#8226; Merathaim is a symbolic name for Babylon, underscoring how thoroughly the nation has provoked God (see <a href="/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2&#8211;3</a>; 51:24).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;go up&#8221; recalls earlier calls to invade Canaan&#8217;s wicked cities (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>; <a href="/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1&#8211;2</a>), reminding us that the LORD uses nations as instruments of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The command demonstrates that Babylon&#8217;s power, though immense, is subject to the Sovereign LORD who &#8220;raises up and brings down&#8221; kingdoms (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And against the residents of Pekod</b><p>The second phrase targets &#8220;the residents of Pekod.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Pekod was a district within Babylon&#8217;s empire, representing its military elite (<a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming both Merathaim and Pekod, God shows the judgment will be comprehensive&#8212;no stronghold or elite force can shield Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-12.htm">Jeremiah 51:12, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; The call echoes earlier warnings that judgment begins with those who seem most secure (Obadiah 3&#8211;4; <a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kill them and devote them to destruction</b><p>&#8220;Kill them and devote them to destruction&#8221; is the same language God gave Israel when purging idolatrous Canaanite cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Babylon had used merciless force against Judah (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;10</a>).

The most probable explanation of its use is that the prophet coined it as a descriptive word (= land of two rebellions), and then substituted it, after his manner (as with Sheshach, <a href="/jeremiah/25-6.htm" title="And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.">Jeremiah 25:6</a>; Magor-missabib, <a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD has not called your name Pashur, but Magormissabib.">Jeremiah 20:3</a>), for the name Aram-Naharaim (= land of the two rivers = Mesopotamia), which was, as in <a href="/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm" title="Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when you came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>; <a href="/judges/3-8.htm" title="Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.">Judges 3:8</a>; <a href="/judges/3-10.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came on him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.">Judges 3:10</a>, the recognised name of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates. It was, he seems to say, the country, not of rivers, but of rebellions, choosing the dual form, partly for the sake of assonance, partly to express the fact that Babylon having rebelled against Assyria, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Merodach-baladan (<a href="/isaiah/39-1.htm" title="At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.">Isaiah 39:1</a>) and Nabopolassar had done, had also rebelled against Jehovah. Possibly, however, the dual may simply express intensity. Such changes of names were quite after the manner of Old Testament usage. So Beth-aven was substituted for Bethel (<a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a>), Mephibosheth for Meribbaal (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm" title="And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.">2Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm" title="And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal; and Meribbaal begat Micah.">1Chronicles 8:34</a>).

Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, "Destroy them with double destruction" (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Pekod</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of punishment.

The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu ( = Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In <a href="/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a> we read, "The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa," etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of <a href="/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a> is "draw sin as with a cart rope" or "draw punishment." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
