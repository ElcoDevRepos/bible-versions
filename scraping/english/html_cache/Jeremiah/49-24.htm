Its mention here indicates a decline in strength and influence. Historically, Damascus was a powerful city-state and a key player in regional politics. The prophecy of its feebleness suggests a divine judgment against it, reflecting the broader theme of God's sovereignty over nations. This aligns with other biblical prophecies where cities and nations are judged for their actions, such as in <a href="/isaiah/17.htm">Isaiah 17:1</a>.<p><b>she has turned to flee.</b><br>The imagery of fleeing suggests a loss of confidence and security. In ancient warfare, cities often relied on their fortifications and military might. The act of fleeing indicates that these defenses have failed. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical theme of divine retribution, where those who oppose God's will are ultimately unable to stand firm. It echoes the fate of other cities and nations that faced God's judgment, such as Babylon in <a href="/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>.<p><b>Panic has gripped her;</b><br>Panic here signifies a sudden and overwhelming fear, often associated with divine intervention. In the biblical context, panic is frequently a tool used by God to disrupt the plans of the wicked, as seen in the story of Gideon in <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>. The psychological impact of panic can be more devastating than physical defeat, indicating a complete breakdown of order and morale within Damascus.<p><b>anguish and pain have seized her</b><br>The use of anguish and pain conveys intense suffering and distress. This is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and calamity, often used to describe the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The imagery of being seized suggests an inescapable and overpowering force, highlighting the totality of the judgment. This can be compared to the descriptions of suffering in Lamentations, where the consequences of Jerusalem's fall are vividly portrayed.<p><b>like a woman in labor.</b><br>The comparison to a woman in labor is a powerful biblical metaphor for inevitable and intense suffering that leads to a new beginning. Labor pains are unavoidable and increase in intensity, symbolizing the certainty and severity of the judgment on Damascus. This imagery is used elsewhere in scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, to describe the suddenness and inevitability of God's judgment. It also points to the hope of eventual deliverance and renewal, as labor ultimately results in birth, suggesting that God's purposes, even in judgment, are redemptive.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital city of Syria, known for its historical significance and as a center of trade and culture in the ancient Near East.

Now Jeremiah shows that decay already settles in.<p>&#8226; Feebleness signals God&#8217;s hand removing human confidence, just as He did to mighty Babylon: &#8220;Babylon&#8217;s warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds; their strength has failed&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture reminds us that no earthly power, however historic or sophisticated, can withstand persistent rebellion against God (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She has turned to flee</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;she has turned to flee.&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>b)<p>&#8226; Instead of standing to defend herself, Damascus turns her back and runs&#8212;precisely the reversal promised in <a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a> when covenant curses fall: &#8220;You will flee when no one is pursuing you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar imagery marks Egypt&#8217;s collapse: &#8220;Why have I seen them dismayed and turned back? Their warriors are beaten down and have fled in haste&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm">Jeremiah 46:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Fleeing exposes complete loss of morale. It also fulfills <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-5</a>, where God vowed to &#8220;break the gate bar of Damascus.&#8221; Once the gate is broken, escape seems the only option.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Panic has gripped her</b><p>&#8220;Panic has gripped her&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>c)<p>&#8226; The Hebrew wording is vivid: hands slack, knees knocking, heart racing. Jeremiah earlier applied it to Judah: &#8220;Anguish has gripped us, agony like a woman in labor&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>). Now the same terror falls on a foreign capital.<p>&#8226; &#8220;I will bring terror upon you&#8230; and you will be driven out, each one headlong&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-5.htm">Jeremiah 49:5</a>) explains why panic dominates; it is the Lord&#8217;s doing, not random circumstance.<p>&#8226; For believers, the scene underscores <a href="/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>&#8212;terror comes &#8220;like a storm&#8221; to those who spurn God&#8217;s wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor.&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>d)<p>&#8226; Labor pains illustrate sudden, unavoidable, intensifying distress (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). Once they begin, there is no turning back; judgment has reached full term.<p>&#8226; Isaiah used the same picture for Babylon: &#8220;They will be dismayed&#8230; pains and agony will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). Jeremiah borrows it to show that Damascus, too, must experience the full contraction of God&#8217;s justice.<p>&#8226; Jesus later spoke of &#8220;birth pains&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>) as signs of the end. The motif, repeated through Scripture, reminds us that God&#8217;s redemptive plan advances even through calamity&#8212;pain will give way to His ultimate purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jeremiah paints a step-by-step collapse of Damascus: strength drained, courage lost, panic overwhelming, agony unavoidable. Each phrase marks God&#8217;s righteous intervention against persistent sin, echoing earlier prophecies and foreshadowing final judgment. The verse urges us to place no confidence in human might but to seek refuge in the Lord, who alone can turn labor pains of judgment into the new birth of salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Damascus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;am&#183;me&#183;&#347;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1834.htm">Strong's 1834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Damascus -- a city in Aram (Syria)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has become feeble;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7503.htm">Strong's 7503: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sink, relax</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she has turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hip&#772;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6437.htm">Strong's 6437: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn, to face, appear, look</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to flee.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
