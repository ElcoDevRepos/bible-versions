The people had turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought help from foreign deities. This reflects a common practice in the ancient Near East, where nations often worshipped multiple gods, each believed to have control over different aspects of life. The cities of Judah and Jerusalem, representing the entire nation, are depicted as collectively engaging in this apostasy.<p><b>to which they have been burning incense,</b><br>Burning incense was a common form of worship in ancient times, symbolizing prayers rising to the deity. In the context of Judah, this practice was adopted from surrounding pagan cultures, despite being prohibited by the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>). The act of burning incense to other gods signifies a deep-seated rebellion against God's commandments and a breach of the covenant relationship established at Sinai.<p><b>but these gods certainly will not save them</b><br>This statement underscores the futility of idolatry. The gods of the nations, often represented by idols, are powerless and cannot deliver in times of trouble. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where the impotence of idols is contrasted with the sovereignty and power of Yahweh (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The inability of these gods to save highlights the foolishness of relying on anything other than the true God.<p><b>in their time of disaster.</b><br>The "time of disaster" refers to the impending judgment that God would bring upon Judah and Jerusalem due to their persistent unfaithfulness. Historically, this disaster culminated in the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent exile in 586 BC. The prophets, including Jeremiah, warned that such calamities were a direct consequence of the nation's disobedience and idolatry. This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
