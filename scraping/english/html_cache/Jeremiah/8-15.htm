In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, the nation was facing the threat of Babylonian invasion. The people desired peace, which in Hebrew is "shalom," a term encompassing not just the absence of conflict but also completeness and well-being. This hope for peace is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the Messiah is called the "Prince of Peace." However, the people's hope was misplaced because they were not seeking peace through repentance and obedience to God.<p><b>but no good has come</b><br>The anticipated peace did not materialize because the people of Judah were relying on false assurances from false prophets who promised safety despite their disobedience to God (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). The absence of good is a direct consequence of their failure to heed God's warnings through Jeremiah. This reflects the biblical principle that true goodness and peace come from aligning with God's will, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings are contingent on obedience.<p><b>for a time of healing</b><br>The people expected a period of restoration and recovery, both physically and spiritually. Healing in the biblical sense often refers to restoration to a state of wholeness and health, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>. The desire for healing indicates an awareness of their broken state, yet they failed to recognize that true healing comes from God alone, as emphasized in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises healing to a repentant nation.<p><b>but there was only terror</b><br>Instead of the anticipated healing, the people experienced terror, likely referring to the fear and destruction brought by the Babylonian army. This terror is a fulfillment of the warnings given by God through Jeremiah, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>, where disaster from the north is prophesied. The terror also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, echoing the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>. This phrase underscores the futility of seeking peace and healing apart from God, pointing to the ultimate peace and healing found in Jesus Christ, who offers reconciliation with God (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
