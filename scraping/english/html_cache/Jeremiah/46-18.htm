It reflects God's eternal nature and His unchanging truth, similar to other divine oaths found in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>). It underscores the reliability of God's promises and judgments.<p><b>declares the King,</b><br>The title "King" refers to God's sovereign rule over all creation. In the context of Jeremiah, it contrasts with earthly kings, particularly Pharaoh of Egypt, who is the subject of this prophecy. God's kingship is a central theme throughout the Bible, affirming His ultimate authority (<a href="/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>whose name is the LORD of Hosts,</b><br>"LORD of Hosts" (Yahweh Sabaoth) signifies God's command over the heavenly armies and His power to execute His will. This title is often used in contexts of divine judgment and deliverance (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). It reassures believers of God's might and His ability to protect and fulfill His purposes.<p><b>there will come one</b><br>This phrase introduces a prophecy of a coming figure or event. In the immediate context, it refers to the impending judgment on Egypt, likely through the Babylonian invasion led by Nebuchadnezzar. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and judgment brought by Christ, the ultimate "one" who fulfills God's promises.<p><b>who is like Tabor among the mountains</b><br>Mount Tabor is a prominent, isolated mountain in northern Israel, known for its distinct shape and visibility. It symbolizes strength and prominence. The comparison suggests the coming figure's significant impact and unmistakable presence, much like Tabor's dominance in the landscape.<p><b>and like Carmel by the sea.</b><br>Mount Carmel is a coastal mountain range known for its beauty and fertility. It was the site of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18). The reference to Carmel highlights the coming figure's majesty and the divine authority accompanying him, akin to the spiritual victory achieved on Carmel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies.

The King of Babylon is compared to "Tabor among the mountains and Carmel by the sea." Mount Tabor is a most prominent object, owing to the wide extent of the plain of Esdraelon, in which it is situated; and a similar remark applies to Mount Carmel. The view of Tabor differs considerably according to the point from which it is taken; but "its true figure is an elongated oval" (Thomson). Carmel, so called from the rich orchards and vineyards with which it was anciently adorned, is not lofty (being only about six hundred feet above the sea), but the form in which it breaks off towards the sea has a beauty of its own. It is now deprived of its rich forest and garden culture, but is still described as "a glorious mountain." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As surely as I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1433;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">live,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the King,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
