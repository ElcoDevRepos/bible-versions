In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet often begins his declarations with this phrase to assert that the message is not his own but from God. This underscores the importance of listening to the words that follow, as they are not merely human opinion but divine revelation. Throughout the Bible, similar phrases are used to introduce prophetic messages, highlighting the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>).<p><b>Do not deceive yourselves:</b><br>The warning against self-deception is a recurring theme in Scripture. In this context, the people of Judah were prone to false hopes and misleading assurances, often from false prophets who contradicted Jeremiah's warnings. This phrase calls for self-examination and a rejection of comforting lies. Biblically, self-deception is often linked to sin and rebellion against God (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, <a href="/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>).<p><b>by saying, &#8216;The Chaldeans will go away for good,&#8217;</b><br>The Chaldeans, also known as the Babylonians, were the dominant power threatening Judah at this time. Historically, the Babylonians had already besieged Jerusalem, and there was a temporary withdrawal due to the Egyptian army's approach (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>). This led some in Judah to believe that the threat was permanently removed. The phrase reflects a false sense of security and a misunderstanding of the geopolitical situation. The Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and were instruments of God's judgment against Judah (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>).<p><b>for they will not!</b><br>This emphatic statement confirms the certainty of the Chaldeans' return and the impending judgment. It serves as a direct contradiction to the false hopes held by the people. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and the inevitability of His plans. The return of the Chaldeans and the eventual fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/39.htm">Jeremiah 39:1-10</a>) fulfill Jeremiah's prophecies, demonstrating the reliability of God's word. This also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of heeding God's warnings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is delivering a message through Jeremiah to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans</a></b><br>Also known as the Babylonians, they were a powerful empire threatening Judah during Jeremiah's time.

When Scripture declares &#8220;the LORD says,&#8221; the matter is settled&#8212;He speaks and His word stands (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Jeremiah has carried this same formula since his call (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7, 17</a>), reminding Judah that every warning, promise, or command he delivers comes directly from the covenant-keeping God. By prefacing the verse this way, the prophet presses the people to listen, believe, and obey, just as later believers are urged to heed all God-breathed Scripture (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not deceive yourselves</b><p>Self-deception had become a national pastime. Earlier, Jeremiah pleaded, &#8220;Do not let your prophets&#8230;deceive you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8-9</a>), yet here the danger is internal: fooling themselves.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently exposes self-inflicted blindness: &#8220;Let no one deceive himself&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>); &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>); &#8220;Prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The heart&#8217;s capacity for denial can smother conviction and invite judgment (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3</a>). Jeremiah calls the people to step into the light of reality while repentance is still possible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By saying, &#8216;The Chaldeans will go away for good&#8217;</b><p>The immediate context explains the wishful rumor. When Pharaoh&#8217;s army marched north, the Babylonian besiegers temporarily withdrew (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>). The citizens of Jerusalem seized on that brief reprieve, spinning it into a permanent deliverance.<p>&#8226; Earlier words from God had already contradicted that hope: &#8220;This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3-5</a>; 34:2-3).<p>&#8226; Trusting political alliances instead of God&#8217;s instruction mirrored past failures (<a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>; 31:1).<p>&#8226; False confidence ignores the pattern of discipline promised in the covenant (<a href="/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27-33</a>) and reiterated through prophets like Habakkuk, who foretold the rise of the Chaldeans as instruments of judgment (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they will not!</b><p>God nullifies the rumor with a firm, final word. The Babylonians&#8217; return is guaranteed, and with it the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah repeats this certainty elsewhere: &#8220;Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s unwavering resolve fulfills both His warning and His character: &#8220;The LORD has done what He purposed; He has fulfilled His word&#8221; (<a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Ignoring that certainty led Judah into greater ruin, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed without remedy.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/37-9.htm">Jeremiah 37:9</a> is a call to face facts under God&#8217;s authoritative voice. He rejects self-made optimism, exposes the lie that temporary relief equals lasting peace, and affirms that His foretold judgment will arrive exactly as spoken. The verse urges every reader to shun comforting illusions, trust the unchanging word of the Lord, and respond with humble obedience before consequences become irreversible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9, 10) <span class= "bld">Deceive not yourselves . . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Deceive not your souls. </span>The words indicate that the king and his counsellors had buoyed themselves up with expectations of deliverance.
