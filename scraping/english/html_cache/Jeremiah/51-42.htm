In biblical literature, the sea often symbolizes chaos and destruction. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its grandeur and might, but it was also a symbol of pride and opposition to God. The imagery of the sea coming over Babylon suggests a complete and inescapable judgment. This can be connected to the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a>, where Babylon's fall is proclaimed. The "sea" may also symbolize the invading armies, particularly the Medes and Persians, who would conquer Babylon.<p><b>she is covered in turbulent waves.</b><br>The turbulent waves indicate the intensity and totality of the destruction. This imagery conveys the idea of Babylon being overwhelmed and unable to withstand the divine judgment. The waves suggest instability and chaos, reflecting the downfall of a once-stable empire. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bring down the proud and the mighty, as echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>, where the fall of Babylon is depicted during the reign of Belshazzar. The turbulent waves also serve as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to humble those who exalt themselves against Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah is known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations, including Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God&#8217;s people.

Just as literal water overruns every barrier, so God&#8217;s judgment overruns Babylon&#8217;s defenses.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah has already used water imagery for invading armies: &#8220;Behold, waters are rising from the north; they will become an overflowing torrent&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>). Medo-Persian forces would surge in the same way.<p>&#8226; Cyrus famously diverted the Euphrates, allowing his troops to march through the drained riverbed; once inside, the river&#8217;s flow was restored&#8212;an apt historical backdrop that makes the prophecy strikingly literal.<p>&#8226; The Lord himself is behind the overflow: &#8220;For the LORD will devastate Babylon; He will silence her loud voice. Their waves roar like great waters&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/51-55.htm">Jeremiah 51:55</a>).<p>&#8226; Other prophets use the same flood language for divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>).
