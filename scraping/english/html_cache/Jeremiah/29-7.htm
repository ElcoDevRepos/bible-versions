The historical context is the Babylonian Exile, which began in 586 BC when Jerusalem was conquered, and many Israelites were taken captive. The command to seek the prosperity of Babylon is significant because it contrasts with the natural inclination to resist or resent their captors. Instead, God instructs them to contribute positively to the society in which they find themselves. This reflects a broader biblical principle of being a blessing to others, even in adverse circumstances, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>, where God promises to make Abraham a blessing to all nations. Theologically, this directive underscores God's sovereignty and purpose, even in exile, suggesting that their presence in Babylon is part of His divine plan.<p><b>Pray to the LORD on its behalf,</b><br>Prayer is a central theme in the Bible, and here, the Israelites are called to intercede for Babylon. This is a radical command, as Babylon was not only their place of exile but also a symbol of oppression and idolatry. The call to pray for their captors echoes Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where He instructs His followers to love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them. This act of prayer signifies a heart aligned with God's will, demonstrating love and forgiveness. It also acknowledges God's ultimate authority over nations and rulers, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>, which states that the king's heart is in the hand of the LORD.<p><b>for if it prospers, you too will prosper.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of the Israelites' well-being with that of Babylon. The prosperity of the city is directly linked to the welfare of the exiles, suggesting a mutual benefit. This principle of seeking the common good is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to live peaceably with all (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>) and to seek the welfare of others (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>). Theologically, this reflects the idea that God's people are to be agents of peace and prosperity wherever they are placed. It also points to the broader biblical narrative of restoration and hope, as God promises to bring the exiles back to their land (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>), foreshadowing the ultimate restoration through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages to the people of Judah, including warnings of impending exile and messages of hope and restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire where the Israelites were exiled.

To refrain from all curses and imprecations, even from such as came from the lips of those who hung their harps on the willows by the waters of Babylon (Psalms 137), to pray for the peace and prosperity of the city where they were eating the bread of captivity--this surely required an almost superhuman patience. Yet this was the prophet's counsel. It seems almost to follow--unless we apply Augustine's rule, <span class= "ital">Distingue tempora, </span>and refer the psalm to a time prior <span class= "ital">to </span>Jeremiah's letter, or nearer the day of vengeance--that those imprecations, natural as they seem, belonged to a lower stage of spiritual progress than that represented by the prophet. He was, to those impatient exiles, as our Lord was to the impatient disciples who sought to call down fire on the village of the Samaritans (<a href="/context/luke/9-54.htm" title="And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?">Luke 9:54-56</a>).
