Ishmael was a member of the royal family and had been appointed by the king of Ammon to assassinate Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians. The number ten is often significant in the Bible, symbolizing completeness or a quorum, as seen in other contexts like the ten commandments or the ten plagues of Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;Do not kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field&#8212;wheat, barley, oil, and honey!&#8221;</b><br>The plea of these men reveals their desperation and resourcefulness. The mention of "hidden treasure" suggests a common practice in times of war and instability, where people would hide their valuables to protect them from invaders. The specific items listed&#8212;wheat, barley, oil, and honey&#8212;were staples of the ancient Near Eastern diet and economy, indicating the wealth and sustenance these items represented. This reflects the agrarian society of ancient Judah, where such produce was vital for survival and trade.<p><b>So he refrained from killing them with the others.</b><br>Ishmael's decision to spare these men highlights his pragmatic nature, valuing the potential gain from the hidden treasures over the act of killing. This action contrasts with his earlier violence, showing a moment of restraint influenced by material gain. The sparing of these men can be seen as a temporary reprieve in the midst of the chaos following the Babylonian conquest, illustrating the unpredictable nature of human decisions in times of crisis. This moment also underscores the theme of survival and the lengths to which individuals will go to preserve their lives, a recurring theme throughout the book of Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>A member of the royal family and a military officer who conspired against Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gedaliah.htm">Gedaliah</a></b><br>The governor of Judah appointed by the Babylonians after the fall of Jerusalem, assassinated by Ishmael.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ten_men.htm">The Ten Men</a></b><br>Individuals who pleaded for their lives by offering hidden resources to Ishmael.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mizpah.htm">Mizpah</a></b><br>The location where Gedaliah was assassinated and where Ishmael carried out his treacherous acts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>The place where the ten men had hidden their stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_betrayal.htm">The Consequences of Betrayal</a></b><br>Ishmael's actions remind us of the destructive power of betrayal and the importance of integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_mercy.htm">The Value of Mercy</a></b><br>The ten men's plea for mercy and Ishmael's response highlight the importance of showing mercy, even when it is not deserved.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_greed.htm">The Dangers of Greed</a></b><br>The offer of hidden resources to spare their lives illustrates how greed can lead to moral compromise.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Despite the immediate injustice, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate justice and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>Ishmael's account serves as a cautionary tale about the need for repentance and turning away from sin.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_41_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 41:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_41_8_God_s_providence_shown.htm">How does Jeremiah 41:8 illustrate God's providence in unexpected situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_mercy_from_Jeremiah_41_8.htm">What lessons on mercy can we learn from Jeremiah 41:8's events?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_41_8_Proverbs_16_7_link.htm">How does Jeremiah 41:8 connect with Proverbs 16:7 about peace with enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Jeremiah_41_8_guide_modern_deals.htm">In what ways can we apply Jeremiah 41:8's themes of negotiation today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_41_8_Trust_God_s_protection.htm">How does Jeremiah 41:8 encourage trust in God's protection during adversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Ishmael_spare_ten_men.htm">Why did Ishmael spare the lives of ten men in Jeremiah 41:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_41_8_Human_nature_insights.htm">What does Jeremiah 41:8 reveal about human nature and survival instincts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_41_8_in_prophecy_context.htm">How does Jeremiah 41:8 fit into the broader narrative of Jeremiah's prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_41.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 41?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_is_ishmael's_royal_lineage_unclear.htm">If Ishmael was a descendant of the royal line, why is there scant genealogical or historical corroboration for his ancestry?
