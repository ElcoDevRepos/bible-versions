It emphasizes the certainty and divine origin of the message. The phrase is often used to introduce a warning or a promise from God, indicating that what follows is inevitable and part of God's sovereign plan. This introduction is similar to other prophetic declarations found in books like Isaiah and Amos, where God announces forthcoming judgment or restoration.<p><b>&#8220;when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh&#8212;&#8221;</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, as established in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>. It was meant to be an outward sign of an inward faith and commitment to God. However, in this context, God is addressing those who rely solely on the physical act of circumcision without true spiritual devotion or obedience. This critique is echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>, where Paul explains that true circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not merely a physical act. The emphasis here is on the inadequacy of external rituals without genuine faith and transformation. This warning serves as a reminder that God desires a relationship that goes beyond mere religious formalities, pointing to the need for internal change and foreshadowing the New Covenant through Christ, where the law is written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to deliver His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jeremiah's prophecies, often criticized for their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, symbolizing spiritual purity and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coming_days.htm">The Coming Days</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to a future time of judgment and reckoning for those who are outwardly religious but inwardly unfaithful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_spirituality_over_ritual.htm">True Spirituality Over Ritual</a></b><br>The verse challenges believers to examine their faith, ensuring it is genuine and not just a matter of outward rituals.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_transformation.htm">Heart Transformation</a></b><br>Emphasizes the importance of a transformed heart, aligning with God's will and reflecting His character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_accountability.htm">Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>Reminds us that God sees beyond external appearances and holds us accountable for our inner lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Encourages believers to live in a way that honors their covenant relationship with God, marked by obedience and love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warning_against_hypocrisy.htm">Warning Against Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Serves as a caution against religious hypocrisy, urging believers to live authentically before God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_9_25_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_9_25_Faith_over_rituals.htm">How does Jeremiah 9:25 emphasize the importance of genuine faith over rituals?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_uncircumcised_in_heart.htm">What does "uncircumcised in heart" mean in the context of Jeremiah 9:25?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ensure_faith_is_genuine_not_ritual.htm">How can we ensure our faith is genuine, not just outward rituals?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_Scriptures_stress_inner_change.htm">What other Scriptures highlight the need for inward transformation over external practices?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_9_25_s_role_in_spiritual_truth.htm">How can Jeremiah 9:25 guide us in evaluating our spiritual authenticity today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_9_25_Physical_vs_spiritual_circumcision.htm">What does Jeremiah 9:25 reveal about God's view on physical versus spiritual circumcision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_9_25_on_rituals_value.htm">How does Jeremiah 9:25 challenge the notion of outward religious rituals?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_heart_circumcision.htm">Why does God emphasize circumcision of the heart in Jeremiah 9:25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_there_records_of_invasions_in_jeremiah_12_14.htm">In Jeremiah 12:14, God mentions punishing invading neighbors.

In the day of God's judgments (this being the connecting link with the preceding verse) there would be no difference between the Jew and other races who like him practised circumcision on the one hand, and the outlying heathen world on the other. Here, again, Jeremiah anticipated St. Paul, "To the Jew first, and also to the Gentile; for there is no respect of persons with God" (<a href="/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;">Romans 2:9</a>). The true circumcision is that which is "in the spirit, not in the letter" (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - A further enforcement of the doctrine that no outward privileges, if dissociated from inward moral vitality, will avail. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - All them which are <span class="cmt_word">circumcised with the uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the circumcised in uncircumcision</span>, or, as Ewald turns it, "all the uncircumcised-circumcised." But what does this enigmatical expression signify? Hitzig, Graf, and apparently Dr. Payne Smith, think that it has a twofold meaning: that, as applied to the Jews, it means circumcised in the flesh, but not in heart, and, as applied to the heathen, simply uncircumcised (the one-half of the phrase neutralizing the other, like "a knife without the blade," "angels with horns and hoofs," etc.). The latter meaning, however, is surely very improbable, and it would only become necessary if it were proved that circumcision was practiced by none of the nations mentioned but the Jews. This is not the case. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were circumcised in very early times (see the drawing of a bas-relief in the Temple of Chunsu at Karnak, given by Dr. Ebers in his 'Egypten und die Bucher Meets'). The assertion that only the priests underwent the operation has no older evidence than that of Origen (edit. Lommatzsch, 4:138), "in whose time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to ridicule and contempt." As to the Ammonites and Moabites, we have, unfortunately, no information. With regard to the Edomites, it is true that, according to Josephus ('Antiq.,' 13:9, 1), they were compelled to accept circumcision by John Hyrcanus. But it is still quite possible that, at an earlier period, the rite was practiced, just as it was among the ancient Arabs, the evidence for which is beyond question (see the writer's article, "Circumcision," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edit.). (On the statement that "all these [the] nations are uncircumcised," see below.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are coming,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declares</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#8217;um-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5002.htm">Strong's 5002: </a> </span><span class="str2">An oracle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;when I will punish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1464;&#1443;&#1511;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;qa&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
