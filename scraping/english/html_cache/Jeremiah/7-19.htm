The context is a rebuke of their idolatrous practices and false worship. Historically, Judah had fallen into the worship of foreign gods, which was a direct violation of the covenant established at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). This phrase highlights God's personal involvement and the relational aspect of the covenant. The provocation is not just against a set of rules but against God Himself, who desires a faithful relationship with His people. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, where God speaks of being provoked to anger by the people's idolatry.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and certainty of the message. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that underscores the divine origin of the message. It assures the audience that these are not merely Jeremiah's words but the very words of God. This divine declaration is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His right to judge His people. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the ultimate judge and lawgiver, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>.<p><b>Is it not themselves they spite,</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the self-destructive nature of Judah's actions. By turning to idolatry, the people are not harming God but themselves. This reflects the biblical principle that sin ultimately leads to self-destruction (<a href="/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>). The historical context shows that Judah's idolatry led to social injustice, moral decay, and eventually, national ruin. This phrase serves as a warning that sin carries inherent consequences, aligning with the wisdom literature's teachings on the folly of rejecting God's ways (<a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>).<p><b>to their own shame?</b><br>The concept of shame in the ancient Near Eastern context is significant. Shame was not just a personal feeling but a social condition that affected one's standing in the community. By engaging in idolatry, the people of Judah brought disgrace upon themselves, both in the eyes of God and among the nations. This phrase also points to the prophetic theme of Israel's shame due to unfaithfulness, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52</a>. Theologically, it underscores the idea that sin leads to dishonor and separation from God, contrasting with the honor and glory found in obedience and faithfulness to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through the prophet Jeremiah.

Instead:<p>&#8226; The question exposes the absurdity of thinking the Creator can be hurt like a pagan idol (<a href="/job/35-6.htm">Job 35:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It recalls His earlier warning, &#8220;I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), showing that His jealousy springs from covenant love, not insecurity.<p>&#8226; Similar challenges appear in <a href="/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where rejecting God is labeled provocation, yet He remains sovereign and intact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>declares the LORD</b><p>These words underscore that the verdict belongs to God Himself, not to Jeremiah&#8217;s personal frustration.

By inserting His name, God:<p>&#8226; Affirms the absolute authority of Scripture (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Invites the people to stop arguing with the messenger and listen to the Author (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Reminds us that every &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; is binding, just as <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a> explains that prophecy comes when &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is it not themselves they spite</b><p>Sin always backfires.
