The timing emphasizes the immediacy of God's message and judgment. In biblical narratives, "the next day" often marks a transition or a pivotal moment, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a> and <a href="/exodus/2-13.htm">Exodus 2:13</a>.<p><b>when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks</b><br>Pashhur was a priest and chief officer in the temple, highlighting the religious authority that opposed Jeremiah. The stocks were a form of public humiliation and punishment, reflecting the hostility Jeremiah faced for his prophecies. This incident underscores the tension between true prophetic messages and established religious institutions, a theme also seen in the New Testament with Jesus' confrontations with religious leaders.<p><b>Jeremiah said to him</b><br>Jeremiah's response is immediate and bold, demonstrating his unwavering commitment to delivering God's message despite persecution. This mirrors the courage of other prophets and apostles who spoke truth to power, such as Elijah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17-18</a>) and Peter before the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>).<p><b>&#8220;The LORD does not call you Pashhur,</b><br>The renaming signifies a divine judgment and a change in identity, similar to how God renamed Abram to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) and Jacob to Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). The name "Pashhur" means "freedom" or "prosperity," which contrasts sharply with the new name given by God.<p><b>but Magor-missabib.</b><br>This name means "terror on every side," indicating the judgment and calamity that would surround Pashhur. It serves as a prophetic declaration of the consequences of opposing God's word. The concept of "terror on every side" is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>, emphasizing the pervasive nature of divine judgment.

Deliverance may not be immediate, but it is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks</b><p>&#8226; Pashhur, the chief officer in the temple, had punished Jeremiah for preaching judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1-2</a>). Stocks were designed for humiliation (cf. <a href="/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s servants have often been confined for speaking truth&#8212;Joseph in prison (<a href="/bsb/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39-40</a>), Micaiah in a cell (<a href="/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26-27</a>), Peter and John in jail (<a href="/acts/4-3.htm">Acts 4:3</a>). Their confinement never silenced the Word (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm">2 Timothy 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s quick release shows that earthly powers can restrain bodies but not the message entrusted to God&#8217;s prophet (<a href="/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeremiah said to him</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah does not seek revenge; he delivers a word from the Lord.

Identity apart from obedience is hollow (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Magor-missabib</b><p>&#8226; The new name means &#8220;terror on every side,&#8221; a phrase Jeremiah has used for imminent judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/6-25.htm">Jeremiah 6:25</a>; 46:5; 49:29; cf. <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Verses 4-6 spell out the sentence: Pashhur and his friends will see Judah fall, be taken to Babylon, and die there.

A single night in stocks could not silence the prophet; instead it set the stage for a sharper proclamation. By renaming Pashhur &#8220;Magor-missabib,&#8221; God declares that those who oppose His Word will be surrounded by the very terror they tried to suppress.

We may venture to think that the Psalm had been his comfort in those night-watches of suffering, and that he now uttered the words which described the bitterness of the Psalmist's sorrow, as at last feeling sure that they belonged to his persecutor rather than to himself. It is scarcely necessary to seek a special significance in the name of Pashur as contrasted with this new <span class= "ital">nomen et omen; </span>but Hebrew scholars, according to various, and it must be owned, conjectural etymologies, have found in it the ideas of wide-spread joy, "joy round about," or else of freedom and deliverance. The prophet repeats the combination in <a href="/jeremiah/46-5.htm" title="Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 46:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-29.htm" title="Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Fear is on every side.">Jeremiah 49:29</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-22.htm" title="You have called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up has my enemy consumed.">Lamentations 2:22</a>, and it had evidently become a kind of "burden" in both senses of the word, weighing on the prophet's thoughts and finding frequent utterance. The word that stands for "fear" is a rare one, and outside the passages now referred to is found only in <a href="/isaiah/31-9.htm" title="And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, said the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.">Isaiah 31:9</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Symbolic change of name. <span class="cmt_word">Not...
