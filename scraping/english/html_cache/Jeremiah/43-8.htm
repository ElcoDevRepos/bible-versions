Jeremiah, known as the "weeping prophet," often received direct messages from God to deliver to the people of Judah. This underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, as it is not Jeremiah's own words but those of the LORD. The phrase also highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people.<p><b>at Tahpanhes:</b><br>Tahpanhes was an important city in ancient Egypt, known today as Tell Defenneh. It was located in the northeastern part of the Nile Delta. This geographical detail is significant as it marks the location where the remnant of Judah fled after the fall of Jerusalem, despite Jeremiah's warnings against going to Egypt. The presence of Jeremiah in Tahpanhes fulfills his role as a prophet to the nations, not just to Israel and Judah. Historically, Tahpanhes was a place of refuge for many fleeing the Babylonian conquest, and its mention here situates the narrative within a broader historical context of political turmoil and migration. The location also serves as a backdrop for the unfolding of God's continued judgment and prophecy, even outside the land of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile of the Jewish people.
