The imagery of God's hand is often used in Scripture to denote power, authority, and personal involvement (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). It underscores the personal relationship between God and His prophets, indicating that Jeremiah's mission is divinely ordained.<p><b>touched my mouth</b><br>The act of touching Jeremiah's mouth symbolizes the impartation of divine words and authority. This mirrors the experience of other prophets, such as Isaiah, whose lips were touched with a coal to purify and prepare him for his mission (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>). It highlights the transformation and empowerment necessary for prophetic ministry, ensuring that the words spoken are not of human origin but divinely inspired.<p><b>and said to me:</b><br>This introduction to God's speech emphasizes the direct communication between God and Jeremiah. It reflects the personal and intimate nature of prophetic revelation, where God speaks clearly and directly to His chosen messenger. This direct communication is a hallmark of true prophecy, distinguishing it from false prophets who speak from their own imagination (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.</b><br>This declaration confirms the divine source of Jeremiah's message. The phrase "My words" indicates that the content of Jeremiah's prophecy is not his own but is given by God. This is a common theme in prophetic literature, where the prophet serves as a mouthpiece for God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), who speaks the words of God with ultimate authority. The assurance that God's words are in Jeremiah's mouth provides him with the confidence and legitimacy needed to confront the people of Judah with challenging messages.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who calls and commissions Jeremiah as a prophet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A young prophet chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah and the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_touch.htm">The Divine Touch</a></b><br>A symbolic act where God touches Jeremiah's mouth, signifying the impartation of divine words and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_commissioning.htm">Divine Commissioning</a></b><br>God personally equips those He calls.

When the Lord reaches out, touches, speaks, and fills our mouths, we can speak with courage, clarity, and conviction, knowing the authority rests not in us but in the unchanging, powerful Word of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The Lord put forth his hand . . .</span>--The symbolic act seems to imply something like a waking vision, like that of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm" title="Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:">Isaiah 6:6</a>), and the act itself reminds us of the "live coal" laid upon the prophet's mouth, as there recorded. The "hand of the Lord," as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm" title="So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.">Ezekiel 3:14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>., and elsewhere, was the received symbol of the special influence of the Spirit of the Lord; and here, as in the case of Isaiah, the act implied the gift of new powers of thought and utterance. The words which a prophet speaks, like those which were to be spoken by the Apostles of Christ (<a href="/matthew/10-20.htm" title="For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.">Matthew 10:20</a>), are not his own words, but those put into his heart by the Spirit of the Father. So "the finger of God" in <a href="/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a> answers to "the Spirit of God" in <a href="/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Touched my mouth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">caused</span> (<span class="accented">his hand</span>) <span class="accented">to touch my mouth</span>. Jeremiah had said that he was unskilled in oratory; the Divine answer is that the words which he has to speak are not his own, but those of Jehovah. Two things are obvious: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The touching of the lips is not purely metaphorical, as in <a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); it represents a real experience. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> This experience, however, can only have been a visionary one, analogous to that vouchsafed to Isaiah at the opening of his prophetic ministry. In the grand account given by Isaiah of his inaugural vision (which has evidently influenced the form of the vision of Jeremiah), we read of the same significant act on the part of one of the seraphim. It is the same act, certainly, but it symbolizes, not as here the communication of a prophetic message (comp. <a href="/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>), but the purification of the lips. Does it not seem as if Isaiah had attained a deeper insight into the spiritual regeneration needed by the prophet than had been granted to Jeremiah? Another point in which Jeremiah's account seems inferior to that of Isaiah is plastic power. Notice how Jeremiah dwells upon the meaning of the words; this is a reflective element which diminishes the poetic power of the narrative. A word may Be added to explain that "visionary" is not here used in opposition to "based on fact." That the two epithets are susceptible of combination is well shown in the vision described by Pere Gratry, in his 'Souvenirs do ma Jeunesse' (pp. 102-105), the reality of which is not in the least impaired in the writer's mind by its thoroughly inward character: "Dens teutes ces seines interieures, je n'imaginais rien... c'etaient de saisissantes et tres-energiques realites auxquelles je ne m'attendais nullement." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reached out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His hand,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">touched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yag&#183;ga&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5060.htm">Strong's 5060: </a> </span><span class="str2">To touch, lay the hand upon, to reach, violently, to strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my mouth,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to me:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
