In the ancient Near Eastern context, sonship implied inheritance, protection, and identity. This longing is consistent with God's covenant with Abraham, where He promised to be a God to his descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). The New Testament echoes this theme, where believers are called children of God through faith in Christ (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-26.htm">Galatians 3:26</a>).<p><b>and give you a desirable land,</b><br>The "desirable land" refers to the Promised Land, a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's promise and blessing. This land, flowing with milk and honey, was a tangible sign of God's favor and a place where His people could thrive (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Historically, the land of Canaan was strategically located, fertile, and a crossroads of ancient civilizations, making it highly desirable.<p><b>the most beautiful inheritance of all the nations!&#8217;</b><br>This phrase highlights the uniqueness and value of the inheritance God intended for Israel. The land was not only physically beautiful but also spiritually significant as the place where God's presence dwelt among His people. The concept of inheritance is crucial in biblical theology, pointing to the ultimate inheritance believers have in Christ, which is eternal and incorruptible (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><b>I thought you would call Me &#8216;Father&#8217;</b><br>God's expectation of being called 'Father' underscores the intimate relationship He desired with Israel. In the cultural context, calling someone 'Father' implied respect, obedience, and a close personal relationship. This expectation is fulfilled in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches His disciples to pray to God as 'Our Father' (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>), indicating a personal and communal relationship with God.<p><b>and never turn away from following Me.</b><br>This phrase reflects God's hope for Israel's faithfulness and loyalty. The historical context shows Israel's repeated cycles of apostasy and repentance, highlighting their struggle to remain faithful. The call to follow God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, with Jesus inviting His disciples to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). This call to faithfulness is a reminder of the covenant relationship that requires commitment and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His desire for a relationship with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The intended recipients of God's promise, representing His chosen people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/desirable_land.htm">Desirable Land</a></b><br>Symbolic of the blessings and inheritance God wishes to bestow upon His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>The relational term God desires His people to use, indicating intimacy and trust.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The broader context in which Israel's inheritance is considered the most beautiful.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_desire_for_relationship.htm">God's Desire for Relationship</a></b><br>God longs for an intimate relationship with His people, desiring to be called "Father."

God will treat repentant Israel as His child: He will lead Israel to trust Him as a father. The days of apostasy ("turning away") will then be over. The original Hebrew seems, to judge from the LXX. version, to have had the plural "ye shall call," "<span class= "ital">ye </span>shall not turn away," the prophet passing from the collective unity to the individuals that composed it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The concluding words of the last verse have turned the current of the prophet's thoughts. "Unto your fathers." Yes; how bright the prospect when that ideal of Israel was framed in the Divine counsels! Condescending accommodation to human modes of thought; <span class="cmt_word">But I said</span> fails to represent the relation of this verse to the preceding. Render, <span class="accented">I indeed had said</span>, and continue, <span class="accented">How will I</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Put thee among the children.</span> This is a very common rendering, but of doubtful correctness. It assumes that, from the point of view adopted (under Divine guidance) in the prophecies of Jeremiah, the various heathen nations were in the relation of sons to Jehovah. This is most improbable; indeed, even <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> does not really favor the doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God in the fullest sense of the word. Moreover, the pronoun rendered "thee" is in the feminine, indicating that the prophet has still in his mind the picture of Israel as Jehovah's bride. It would surely be an absurd statement that Jehovah would put his bride among the children! Render, therefore, <span class="accented">How will I found thee with sons!</span> comparing, for the use of the Hebrew verb, <a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, and for that of the preposition, <a href="/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>. It is, in fact, the familiar figure by which a family or a nation is likened to a building ("house of Abraham," "of Israel"). Jehovah's purpose had been to make Abraham's seed as the dust of the earth (<a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>). Instead of that, the restored exiles would be few, and weak in proportion, so that the Jewish Church of the early restoration period is represented as complaining, "We made not the land salvation, neither were inhabitants of the world produced" (<a href="/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>). A special Divine promise was needed to surmount this grave difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">A goodly... nations</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a heritage the most glorious among the nations</span>. So in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6, 15</a>) Palestine is described as "the glory of all lands." The want of irrigation, and the denudation of the land, have no doubt much diminished the natural beauty and fertility of Palestine; but wherever moderate care is bestowed on the soil, how well it rewards it! <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call me... shalt not turn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou wilt call me</span>... <span class="accented">wilt not turn</span>. It is the continuation of Jehovah's ideal for Israel. In response to his loving gifts, Israel would surely recognize him as her Father, and devote to him all her energies in willing obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Father</span> is here used, not in the spiritual and individualizing sense of the New Testament, but in such a sense as a member of a primitive Israelitish family, in which the <span class="accented">pairia potestas</span> was fully carried out, could realize. The first instance of the individualizing use of the term is in Ecclus. 23:1-4.
