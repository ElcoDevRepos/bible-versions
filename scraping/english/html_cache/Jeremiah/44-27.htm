The concept of God "watching over" is often associated with protection and blessing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>), but here it is inverted to signify divine judgment. This reversal underscores the seriousness of their disobedience. Theologically, it highlights the principle that God's protection is contingent upon obedience to His covenant. The idea of God actively bringing harm rather than good is a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent rebellion against Him.<p><b>and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt</b><br>The historical context is crucial here. After the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, some Judeans fled to Egypt for refuge, despite Jeremiah's warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/42-19.htm">Jeremiah 42:19-22</a>). Egypt, often a symbol of worldly reliance and idolatry, was a place God had explicitly told them not to return to (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). This act of fleeing to Egypt represents a lack of trust in God's promises and a return to old dependencies, reminiscent of Israel's past bondage.<p><b>will meet his end by sword or famine</b><br>This phrase indicates the means of judgment: sword and famine, common instruments of divine retribution in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a>). The sword represents warfare and violence, while famine signifies scarcity and suffering. These judgments are consistent with the curses outlined in the covenant for disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). The use of these specific judgments underscores the severity of their rebellion and the certainty of God's word being fulfilled.<p><b>until they are finished off</b><br>The phrase "finished off" indicates the completeness of the judgment. It suggests that the consequences will be thorough and leave no remnant of those who defied God's command by seeking refuge in Egypt. This totality of judgment serves as a stark warning to the people of God about the seriousness of covenant unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and separation of the righteous from the unrighteous, a theme that is further developed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.
