The title "God of Israel" reaffirms His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel. This introduction is typical in prophetic literature, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but from God Himself. It sets the stage for the divine message that follows, demanding attention and reverence.<p><b>In your own name you have sent out letters to all the people of Jerusalem,</b><br>This phrase highlights the unauthorized actions of Shemaiah, who took it upon himself to send letters. The act of sending letters "in your own name" suggests a presumption of authority and a challenge to the established prophetic order. In the ancient Near East, letters were a common means of communication, especially for official or authoritative messages. This action reflects a direct challenge to Jeremiah's prophetic authority and God's message through him.<p><b>to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests.</b><br>Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, was a priest during the time of Jeremiah. His role as a priest would have made him a significant religious leader in Jerusalem, responsible for maintaining the temple worship and upholding the law. The mention of "all the priests" indicates that the message was intended to influence the entire religious leadership of Jerusalem. This reflects the tension between the prophetic and priestly offices during this period, as false prophets and unauthorized leaders often sought to undermine true prophetic messages.<p><b>You said to Zephaniah:</b><br>This phrase introduces the content of Shemaiah's message to Zephaniah. It sets up the confrontation between the false message of Shemaiah and the true message of God through Jeremiah. The direct address to Zephaniah suggests an attempt to sway him and the other priests against Jeremiah, highlighting the internal conflict within the religious community of Jerusalem. This conflict is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where true prophets often face opposition from established religious authorities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly armies, underscoring His authority in the message delivered.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_god_of_israel.htm">The God of Israel</a></b><br>This designation highlights God's covenant relationship with Israel, reminding the people of His faithfulness and their obligations to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, often facing opposition and persecution for his prophecies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah_son_of_maaseiah.htm">Zephaniah son of Maaseiah</a></b><br>A priest in Jerusalem during Jeremiah's time, who received the letter mentioned in this verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priests_of_jerusalem.htm">The Priests of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were responsible for spiritual guidance and maintaining the temple worship, often caught between political pressures and prophetic messages.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_authority.htm">God's Sovereignty and Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control and His plans will prevail, even when human leaders or false prophets attempt to assert their own agendas.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_true_prophecy.htm">The Importance of True Prophecy</a></b><br>Discernment is crucial in distinguishing between true and false messages.

Their object was to urge Zephaniah, who appears in <a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2Kings 25:18</a> as the <span class= "ital">Sagan, </span>or second priest, to exercise his authority to restrain Jeremiah from prophesying, and to punish him as a false prophet. It was an attempt to turn the tables on him for the manner in which he had thwarted the plans of the party of revolt at Babylon. The part taken by Zephaniah in acting for the king when he wished to consult Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-1.htm" title="The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,">Jeremiah 21:1</a>), and imploring his intercession (<a href="/jeremiah/37-3.htm" title="And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us.">Jeremiah 37:3</a>), makes it probable that he endeavoured to maintain a neutral Gamaliel-like position between the two parties, and had seemed so lukewarm and temporising that he was open to the influence of threats. On the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuzaradan he was taken prisoner and slain (<a href="/context/jeremiah/52-24.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">Jeremiah 52:24-27</a>).<span class= "bld"><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">In your own name</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#353;im&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
