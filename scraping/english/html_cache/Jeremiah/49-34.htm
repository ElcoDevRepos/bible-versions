Together these details emphasize God&#8217;s absolute authority, His global oversight, and the trustworthy nature of His prophetic Word&#8212;setting the stage for the forthcoming verdict and eventual restoration announced in verses 35&#8211;39.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam . . .</span>--It is noticeable that this is the only prophecy in Jeremiah 48, 49 with a date attached to it. Assuming the date to be rightly given, it indicates a time later than that of those that precede it, which belong probably to the group of predictions connected with Jeremiah 25. It has been maintained, however, by many critics that the absence of the name of Nebuchadnezzar, so prominent in Jeremiah's predictions after the deportation of Jehoiachin, indicates an earlier rather than a later date, and that the compiler of the prophecies was mistaken in thus fixing the time of its delivery. The inference is, however, somewhat precarious, as the fact is common to the prophecies against the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, &c., that precede this. Elam, though commonly identified with Persia, as in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a>, appears to be used with a somewhat wider connotation for the tribes beyond the Tigris (<a href="/jeremiah/25-25.htm" title="And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes,">Jeremiah 25:25</a>). The tone of the prophecy seems to imply that Elam had been prominent among the enemies of the people of Jehovah (as in <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a>), and this has led to the inference that they had taken part in the attack on Judah, as auxiliaries in the army of Nebuchadnezzar. It is significant that the thought that Elam is to be the instrument of Jehovah for the destruction of Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm" title="A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer deals treacherously, and the spoiler spoils. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.">Isaiah 21:2</a>), and that out of it was to come the appointed deliverer of Israel, does not seem to have been present to the prophet's mind. His horizon is, as it were, bounded for the time by the more immediate future. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 34-39.</span> - Concerning Elam. The title places this prophecy later than these in <a href="/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1-49:33</a>; viz. at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. From this filet, and from the absence of any reference to Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument of Elam's humiliation, Ewald conjectures that the Elamites had been concerned in the events which led to the dethronement and captivity of Jehoiachin. Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to accept this hypothesis, remarking that the Elamites "appear perpetually as the allies of Merodach-baladan and his sons in their struggles for independence." We are not yet, however, in possession of information as to the relations of Elam to the great Babylonian empire which rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian. Ewald's conjecture is a possibility, and no more. And what was Elam? One of the most ancient kingdoms in the world (see <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.). Geographically it was the tract of country., partly mountainous, partly lowland, lying south of Assyria and east of Persia proper, to which Herodotus gives the name of Cissia, and the classical geographers that of Tusis or Tusiaua. This is clear, says Sehrader, from the Persian text of the Behistun inscription of Darius. It is fro-quently mentioned under the name "Ilam," or "Ilamti," in the Assyrian inscriptions, especially in those of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assurbauipal. In B.C 721 Sargon states that he annexed a district or province of Elam (and hence, perhaps, we must explain the mention of the Elamites in the Assyrian army in <a href="/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), which was, doubtless, one cause of the embittered feeling towards Assyria of the portion which remained independent. The annals of the heroic struggle of Merodach-baladan contain repeated reference to the King of Elam. Assurbanipal made no less than three invasions of Elam, and the singular pretext for the third is, curiously enough, associated with the remarkable fourteenth chapter of Genesis. It was this - that the Elamite king had refused to deliver up an image of the goddess Nana, which Kudur-nankhundi, an ancient Elamite monarch, had carried oft, and which had remained 1635 or (perhaps) 1535 years in Elam. This king has been plausibly conjectured to be a member of the same dynasty as "Chedorlaomer [ = Kudur-Lagamar] King of Elam." This time it was all over with Elam; Shushan itself was plundered and destroyed, and far and wide the country was laid waste. That so restless and courageous a people should have become famous among the surrounding nations was only to be expected; and it is a striking proof of this that Ezekiel, in describing the companions whom fallen Egypt would meet with in Hades, mentions "Elam and all her multitude" (<a href="/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>). The fact that the Septuagint has the heading twice over - first very briefly (in <a href="/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>, where it is followed by this prophecy), and then at full length (in <a href="/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>, at the end of the prophecy of Elam) - has been variously explained. It is, at any rate, clear that there is some confusion in the present text of this translation. In connection with this prediction it is interesting to notice one of the results of a new cuneiform discovery among some tablets acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. At the very time when Nebuchadnezzar was taking an oath of allegiance from Zedekiah, he was also engaged in hostilities against Elam.
