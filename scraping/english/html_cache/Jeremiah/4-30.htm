The term "devastated one" reflects the impending judgment and destruction due to their unfaithfulness to God. Historically, this period was marked by the Babylonian threat, as Judah faced the consequences of their idolatry and disobedience. The rhetorical question "what will you do" emphasizes the futility of their actions and the inevitability of divine judgment.<p><b>though you dress yourself in scarlet</b><br>Scarlet clothing was often associated with wealth, status, and sometimes sinfulness. In the context of Judah, it symbolizes their attempts to present themselves as prosperous and secure despite their spiritual corruption. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical passages where outward appearances are contrasted with inner realities, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sin is described as scarlet.<p><b>though you adorn yourself with gold jewelry</b><br>Gold jewelry signifies attempts to attract or impress, often used in the context of idolatry or alliances with foreign nations. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such adornments were common in rituals and as symbols of allegiance. This reflects Judah's reliance on political alliances and idolatrous practices instead of trusting in God.<p><b>though you enlarge your eyes with paint</b><br>The practice of painting the eyes, or using kohl, was common in ancient times for beauty and allure. This phrase suggests Judah's efforts to make themselves appealing to other nations or gods, akin to spiritual adultery. It echoes the warnings against such practices found in <a href="/ezekiel/23-40.htm">Ezekiel 23:40</a>, where similar imagery is used to describe Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>You adorn yourself in vain</b><br>The futility of Judah's efforts is highlighted here. Despite their attempts to secure their future through external means, their actions are ultimately meaningless without repentance and faithfulness to God. This echoes the biblical theme that true security and beauty come from a right relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>.<p><b>your lovers despise you</b><br>"Lovers" refers to the foreign nations and false gods Judah sought after. Despite their efforts to win favor, these entities ultimately reject and betray them. This reflects the biblical principle that reliance on anything other than God leads to disappointment and betrayal, as seen in <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5-7</a>, where Israel's unfaithfulness is depicted in similar terms.<p><b>they want to take your life</b><br>The ultimate consequence of Judah's unfaithfulness is destruction. The nations they trusted turn against them, leading to their downfall. This serves as a warning of the dangers of idolatry and misplaced trust, reinforcing the prophetic message that only God can provide true protection and life, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The lovers, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the allies, shall become her foes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when thou art spoiled</span>, etc. It is Jerusalem who is addressed - Jerusalem, personified as a woman, who decks herself out finely to please her admirers. All these arts are in vain, for a violent repulsion has converted her lovers into her deadly enemies. And when Jerusalem is "spoiled," or taken by storm, what device will there be left to attempt? The "lovers" are the foreign powers to whom the Jews paid court (<a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18, 36</a>, 87). <span class="cmt_word">Though thou rentest thy face</span>, etc; alluding to the custom of Eastern women, who try to make their eyes seem larger by putting powdered antimony (the Arabic <span class="accented">kohl</span>) upon their eyelids. So, for instance, did Jezebel (see <a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>:30); and one of Job's daughters received the name Keren-happuch, "box of antimony," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. one who sets off the company in which she is, as antimony does the eye. An old author, Dr. Shaw, writes thus: "None of these ladies take themselves to be completely dressed till they have tinged the hair and edges of their eyelids with the powder of lead ore. And as this operation is performed by dipping first into this powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we have a lively image of what the prophet (<a href="/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) may be supposed to mean" (Shaw, 'Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 229). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun -
