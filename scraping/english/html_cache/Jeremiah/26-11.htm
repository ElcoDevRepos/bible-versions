The priests were responsible for temple rituals and maintaining the law, while prophets were seen as messengers of God. However, not all prophets were true prophets of God; some were false prophets who spoke what the people wanted to hear. The officials and people represent the broader society, including political leaders and common citizens. This gathering indicates a formal assembly, possibly at the temple, where matters of public concern were addressed. The involvement of both religious and civil leaders highlights the gravity of the situation.<p><b>&#8220;This man is worthy of death</b><br>The accusation of being "worthy of death" reflects the severity of Jeremiah's perceived offense. According to the Mosaic Law, false prophecy or blasphemy could be punishable by death (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). The priests and prophets viewed Jeremiah's message as a threat to their authority and the nation's security. This phrase echoes the later trial of Jesus Christ, where religious leaders also sought His death for perceived blasphemy and threats to their power (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65-66</a>).<p><b>for he has prophesied against this city</b><br>Jeremiah's prophecies often included warnings of destruction and calls for repentance, which were unpopular among the people and leaders of Jerusalem. His message was seen as unpatriotic and defeatist, especially during a time when national pride and security were paramount. The city in question is Jerusalem, the spiritual and political center of Judah. Prophecies against Jerusalem were particularly inflammatory, as the city was considered God's chosen dwelling place (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>).<p><b>as you have heard with your own ears!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the direct and public nature of Jeremiah's prophecies. The people and officials had personally heard his warnings, leaving no room for misinterpretation or secondhand accounts. This public proclamation is significant, as it fulfills the role of a prophet to deliver God's message openly, regardless of the consequences. The insistence on firsthand hearing underscores the accountability of the audience; they cannot claim ignorance of the prophetic warning. This mirrors the New Testament call for believers to heed the words of Christ and His apostles, as they have been clearly presented (<a href="/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Earlier, the Lord lamented, &#8220;The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own authority&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>). Their reaction here reflects the pattern of corrupt clergy throughout Israel&#8217;s history&#8212;think of Pashhur beating Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1-2</a>) or Amaziah silencing Amos (<a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-13</a>). Jesus later confronts the same mindset when He cries, &#8220;Woe to you, because you build the tombs of the prophets, but your fathers killed them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/11-47.htm">Luke 11:47-51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the officials and all the people</b><p>A formal assembly now gathers in the temple courts (<a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>). Civil leaders and common folk alike must decide whether they will heed the prophet or silence him. The scene echoes Moses&#8217; instructions that difficult cases be brought &#8220;before the priests and judges who are in office&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>). Much later, another innocent Man will stand before rulers stirred up by priests and crowds (<a href="/matthew/27-1.htm">Matthew 27:1, 20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This man is worthy of death&#8221;</b><p>Without investigation they pronounce the capital verdict. They twist Deuteronomy&#8217;s command to execute false prophets (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>), yet Jeremiah&#8217;s message came straight from the LORD (<a href="/jeremiah/26-12.htm">Jeremiah 26:12-15</a>). The false accusation foreshadows the cry against Christ, &#8220;He ought to die&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-7.htm">John 19:7</a>), and against Stephen, &#8220;They cast him out of the city and stoned him&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58-59</a>). God&#8217;s messengers often pay a high price for truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for he has prophesied against this city</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s &#8220;Temple Sermon&#8221; warned Jerusalem of devastation like Shiloh&#8217;s (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12-14</a>). The leaders treat such prophecy as treason, yet Micah had earlier foretold, &#8220;Zion will be plowed like a field&#8221; (<a href="/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>; cited in <a href="/jeremiah/26-18.htm">Jeremiah 26:18</a>) and was not condemned. The real issue is not Jeremiah&#8217;s tone but their hard hearts. When Jesus predicts the temple&#8217;s fall (<a href="/matthew/24-2.htm">Matthew 24:2</a>) or Stephen is accused of speaking &#8220;against this holy place&#8221; (<a href="/acts/6-13.htm">Acts 6:13-14</a>), the same charge resurfaces.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as you have heard with your own ears!</b><p>They appeal to the crowd&#8217;s firsthand hearing as irrefutable evidence. Ironically, those very ears should have led to repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3, 5</a>). James later reminds believers, &#8220;Be quick to listen, slow to speak&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>); here the people are quick to condemn. Jesus says, &#8220;If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>). Hearing truth brings responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/26-11.htm">Jeremiah 26:11</a> shows corrupt religious leaders rallying officials and citizens to demand the prophet&#8217;s death because he dared speak God&#8217;s judgment over Jerusalem. Their swift verdict, masked as zeal for the Law, actually exposes hardened hearts unwilling to repent. The verse highlights the cost of faithful proclamation, the danger of mob justice, and the timeless battle between human authority and divine truth&#8212;a conflict ultimately culminating in the trials of Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">This man is worthy to die.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">A judgment of death for this man. </span>The phrase seems to have been in current forensic use.
