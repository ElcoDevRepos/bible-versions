The mention of "desert creatures and hyenas" symbolizes desolation and abandonment, as these animals are typically associated with uninhabited and barren areas. In biblical times, such creatures were often seen as unclean and indicative of a cursed or forsaken place. This imagery aligns with the prophetic declarations against Babylon, emphasizing its complete downfall and the reversal of its former glory. The prophecy reflects the judgment of God upon Babylon for its idolatry and oppression of Israel, as seen in other prophetic books like <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>, which also describes wild animals inhabiting the ruins of Babylon.<p><b>and ostriches will dwell there</b><br>Ostriches, known for inhabiting desolate and arid regions, further emphasize the theme of desolation. In the ancient Near East, ostriches were often associated with wilderness and solitude. The presence of such creatures in Babylon signifies the total abandonment and ruin of the city. This imagery serves as a stark contrast to Babylon's previous status as a center of civilization and power. The use of animals to depict desolation is a common biblical motif, reinforcing the idea of divine judgment and the reversal of human pride and achievement.<p><b>It will never again be inhabited</b><br>This phrase underscores the permanence of Babylon's destruction. The prophecy declares that Babylon will not be rebuilt or repopulated, highlighting the finality of God's judgment. Historically, Babylon did experience periods of decline and eventual abandonment, aligning with the prophetic word. The phrase also serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of pride and rebellion against God. The idea of a city being permanently uninhabited is echoed in other biblical prophecies, such as the destruction of Edom in <a href="/isaiah/34-10.htm">Isaiah 34:10</a>, where it is said that "it will not be quenched night or day."<p><b>or lived in from generation to generation</b><br>This emphasizes the enduring nature of Babylon's desolation. The phrase "from generation to generation" suggests a perpetual state, indicating that the judgment is not temporary but will last indefinitely. This serves as a testament to the sovereignty and power of God, who alone determines the rise and fall of nations. The historical reality of Babylon's decline and eventual desolation serves as a fulfillment of this prophecy. The phrase also reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where the consequences of sin and rebellion extend beyond the immediate generation, affecting future ones as well.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire that is the subject of God's judgment in this passage.
