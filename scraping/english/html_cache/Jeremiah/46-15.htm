The rhetorical question highlights the unexpected nature of Egypt's defeat, as they were a powerful nation with a formidable military. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>, where reliance on military might is contrasted with trust in God.<p><b>They cannot stand,</b><br>The inability of the Egyptian warriors to stand signifies their complete defeat and demoralization. This phrase underscores the futility of human strength when opposed by divine will. It echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which contrasts trust in chariots and horses with trust in the name of the Lord. The imagery of falling warriors also serves as a metaphor for the collapse of human pride and self-reliance.<p><b>for the LORD has thrust them down.</b><br>This clause attributes the defeat directly to the action of the LORD, emphasizing His control over historical events. It reflects the biblical principle that God raises and brings down nations according to His purposes, as seen in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>. The use of the term "thrust" suggests a decisive and forceful action, indicating that the defeat was not merely a result of military strategy but a divine intervention. This aligns with the prophetic nature of Jeremiah's message, where God's judgment is executed through historical events. Theologically, it points to the ultimate authority of God over all earthly powers, a theme that resonates throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation addressed in this prophecy, known for its historical power and influence in the ancient Near East.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, often seen as a symbol of earthly power and opposition to God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who exercises sovereign control over the nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/warriors_of_egypt.htm">Warriors of Egypt</a></b><br>The military forces of Egypt, representing human strength and reliance on worldly power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their leaders.

The former gives the rendering "Why did Apis flee from thee, and thy chosen calf abode not" as if referring to the bull Apis as the representative of Osiris, the chief deity of Egypt; and this version receives some support from the use of the Hebrew words for "oxen," "bulls," "beasts," in <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm" title="And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.">Isaiah 34:7</a> and <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-30.htm" title="Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter you the people that delight in war.">Psalm 68:30</a>, and from the fact that the same word is used in <a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm" title="Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-26.htm" title="And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.">Isaiah 49:26</a> as a Divine name "the mighty one of Israel." So understood, the prophet's words contemplate the triumph of the God of Israel over the theriomorphic deity of Egypt. We may find a literal fulfilment of the words in the slaughter of the sacred bull by Cambyses (Herod. iii. 29).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why are thy valiant men,</span> etc.? The literal rendering of the received text is, <span class="accented">Why is thy strong ones</span> (plural) <span class="accented">swept sway</span> (or, <span class="accented">ca</span>s<span class="accented">t down</span>)<span class="accented">? He stood not, because Jehovah thrust him!</span> It is true that the first half of the verse might, consistently with grammar, be rendered, "Why are thy strong ones swept away?" But the following singulars prove that the subject of the verb in the first verse half must itself be a singular. We must, therefore, follow the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and many of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, and change the plural "strong ones" into the singular "strong one." The word so rendered is elsewhere in Jeremiah one used (in the plural) of strong horses (<a href="/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>); but there is no necessity to bind ourselves to this acceptation. Other possible meanings are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> strong man, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a> and <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> steer, bull, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a> and Psalm 50:13, and (metaphorically of princes) Psalm 68:31. It is a tenable view that "thy strong one" is to be understood distributively as equivalent to "every strong one of thine." But it is certainly more plausible to regard the phrase as a synonym for Apis, the sacred bull in which the supreme god Osiris was believed by the Egyptians to be incarnate. This was a superstition (strange, no doubt, but not so ignoble as some have thought) as deeply ingrained in the Egyptian mind as any in their complicated religion. "In fact, they believed that the supreme God was with them when they possessed a bull bearing certain hieratic marks, the signs of the incarnation of the divinity" (Pierrot). His death was the signal for a mourning as general as for a Pharaoh, and the funeral ceremonies (accounts of which are given in the inscriptions) were equally splendid. M. Mariette has discovered, in the neighbourhood of Memphis, a necropolis in which the Apis bulls were successively interred from the eighteenth dynasty to the close of the period of the Ptolemies. For the Apis to be "swept away" like ordinary plunder, or "cast down" in the slaughtering trough (comp. <a href="/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>), was indeed a token that the glory of Egypt had departed. It is a singular coincidence that the very word here employed by Jeremiah for "bull" (abbir) was adopted (like many other words) into the Egyptian language - it received the slightly modified form <span class="accented">aber</span>. The Septuagint, it should be added, is in favour of the general view of the verse thus obtained, and the authority of the <span class="accented">Egyptian-Jewish</span> version in a prophecy relative to Egypt is not slight. Its rendering of the first half is, "Why hath Apis, thy chosen calf, fled?" But the probability is that it read the Hebrew differently, "Why hath Khaph ( = Apis), thy chosen one, fled?" This merely involves grouping some letters otherwise, and reading one word a little differently. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mad&#183;d&#363;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4069.htm">Strong's 4069: </a> </span><span class="str2">Why? for what reason?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have your warriors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ab&#183;b&#238;&#183;re&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_47.htm">Strong's 47: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mighty, valiant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">been laid low?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(nis&#183;&#7717;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5502.htm">Strong's 5502: </a> </span><span class="str2">To scrape off</span><br /><br /><span class="word">They cannot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stand,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;ma&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has thrust them down.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1508;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1920.htm">Strong's 1920: </a> </span><span class="str2">To thrust, drive, push</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/46-15.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 46:15 Why are your strong ones swept away?
