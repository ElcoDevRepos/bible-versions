Egypt was a significant force in the ancient Near East, and its rulers were considered divine by their people. The mention of Pharaoh here underscores the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, extending even to powerful nations. Historically, Egypt had been both an ally and adversary to Israel, as seen in the Exodus narrative and during the reigns of various kings of Judah. The judgment against Pharaoh signifies the futility of relying on Egypt for security, a recurring theme in the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><b>his officials</b><br>The officials of Pharaoh would include high-ranking members of the Egyptian government and military. These individuals were responsible for executing the king's policies and maintaining the stability of the nation. In the biblical narrative, officials often played crucial roles in the administration of justice and governance. The inclusion of officials in the judgment highlights that God's justice is impartial, affecting all levels of society. This can be paralleled with the judgment against the officials of Babylon and other nations, emphasizing that no position of power is immune to divine accountability (<a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>).<p><b>his leaders</b><br>Leaders in this context likely refer to the various regional and local authorities within Egypt, including military commanders and governors. These leaders were instrumental in maintaining the order and implementing the decrees of Pharaoh. The judgment against them signifies the collapse of the societal structure and the inability of human leadership to withstand divine intervention. This reflects the broader biblical theme that human wisdom and strength are insufficient without reliance on God (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><b>and all his people</b><br>The phrase "all his people" indicates that the judgment is not limited to the elite but extends to the entire population of Egypt. This comprehensive judgment serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility of a nation and the widespread impact of sin. In the biblical narrative, the people of a nation often suffer the consequences of their leaders' actions, as seen in the plagues of Egypt during the Exodus (Exodus 7-12). This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment of all nations, where every individual will be accountable before God (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh,_king_of_egypt.htm">Pharaoh, King of Egypt</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the political and military power of the nation.

In other words:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s judgment is no respecter of political power.<p>&#8226; Earthly thrones cannot shield anyone from the Sovereign King (<a href="/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25-26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2-6</a>).<p>The verse reminds us that leaders who exalt themselves against God eventually face the consequences of that rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his officials</b><p>The Hebrew idea behind &#8220;officials&#8221; points to the inner circle&#8212;court advisers, counselors, and ministers. They shaped national policy, so the indictment singles them out. Cross references underline that God holds advisers responsible for steering nations toward or away from His will (<a href="/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11-13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8-11</a>).<p>Bullet points for application:<p>&#8226; Influence equals responsibility.<p>&#8226; Shared guilt accompanies shared decision-making (<a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; <a href="/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his leaders</b><p>Often rendered &#8220;princes&#8221; or &#8220;commanders,&#8221; this group includes military chiefs and provincial governors.

The Lord&#8217;s pattern is consistent: when armies trust in horses and chariots rather than in Him, defeat follows (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1-3</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Military strength is no match for divine justice.<p>&#8226; National security ultimately rests on submission to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his people</b><p>The sweep of judgment lands on the common populace, not merely the elite. As in the Exodus plagues (<a href="/exodus/9-24.htm">Exodus 9:24-26</a>) and Isaiah&#8217;s oracle (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1-4</a>), the entire nation experiences the fallout of its leaders&#8217; rebellion and its own idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15-17</a>).<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; Corporate sin brings corporate consequences.<p>&#8226; Yet within national judgment, individuals can still respond to God&#8217;s mercy (<a href="/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27-28</a>; <a href="/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Jeremiah 25:19</a> lists Egypt&#8217;s king, officials, leaders, and people to show that God&#8217;s cup of wrath spares no social tier. Power, influence, and numbers cannot shield a nation from divine accountability. Each class helped perpetuate rebellion, so each class must drink the cup. The verse calls every generation to remember that the Lord of hosts governs history, judges sin impartially, and invites repentance before judgment falls.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Pharaoh king of Egypt . . .</span>--The list of the nations begins, it will be seen, from the south and proceeds northwards; those that lay on the east and west being named, as it were, literally, according to their position.

After leaving Judah and Jerusalem, the prophet turns to the far south - to Egypt; then he ascends to the south-east (Uz), and the south-west (the Philistines); thence he passes to the east (Edom, Moab, Ammon); and thence to the west of the Holy Land (Phoenicia). This suggests the maritime lands "beyond the sea" (including especially Cyprus); a sudden transition brings the prophet to the Arabian tribes (Dedan, etc.), from whence he passes by the road of the northeast (Elam, Media) to the indefinitely distant north. Last of all, in solitary grandeur or infamy, Babylon is mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Pharaoh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;ra&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his officials,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1445;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
