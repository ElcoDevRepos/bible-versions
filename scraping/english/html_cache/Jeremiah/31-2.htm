It is a common prophetic formula used throughout the Old Testament to signify that the message is directly from God, not the prophet's own words. This underscores the importance and reliability of the message that follows.<p><b>The people who survived the sword:</b><br>This refers to the Israelites who escaped the destruction and violence of their enemies, particularly during the Babylonian conquest. Historically, this can be linked to the remnant of Israel that survived various military invasions. The "sword" symbolizes warfare and judgment, often seen as a tool of divine retribution. This phrase highlights God's preservation of a faithful remnant despite widespread calamity.<p><b>found favor in the wilderness:</b><br>The wilderness is a significant motif in biblical history, often representing a place of testing, purification, and divine encounter. For the Israelites, the wilderness was where they wandered after the Exodus from Egypt, a time when they experienced God's provision and guidance. Finding "favor" suggests divine grace and protection, indicating that God was with them even in desolate and challenging circumstances. This can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and preparation.<p><b>when Israel went to find rest:</b><br>This phrase alludes to the journey towards the Promised Land, a place of rest and fulfillment of God's promises. Historically, it reflects the hope of returning to a state of peace and security after exile or hardship. Theologically, "rest" is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing not only physical rest but also spiritual peace and salvation. It foreshadows the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>, where believers are invited to enter God's rest through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_who_survived_the_sword.htm">The People Who Survived the Sword</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who endured the Babylonian conquest and exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>Symbolic of a place of testing and transformation, reminiscent of the Israelites' journey after the Exodus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, often representing the collective people of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rest.htm">Rest</a></b><br>A state of peace and restoration promised by God, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_trials.htm">God's Faithfulness in Trials</a></b><br>Just as God was faithful to the Israelites in the wilderness, He remains faithful to us in our trials.

Israel of old had "found grace in the wilderness" (comp. <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>). But as the prophet has in his thoughts a new manifestation of that love, his language is modified accordingly. He thinks of the captives that had escaped, or should hereafter escape, the sword of the Chaldaeans (there had been no such deliverance in the case of the Egyptian exodus), and of their finding grace in the wilderness that lies between Palestine and the Euphrates. The verses that follow show, however, that the prophet is thinking also of the more distant exiles, the ten tribes in the cities of the Medes beyond the Tigris (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.</span>--The verb that answers to the last five words includes the meaning of "settling" or "establishing," as well as of giving rest; and the whole clause is better translated <span class= "ital">Let me go, </span>or <span class= "ital">I will go </span>(the verb is in the infinitive with the force of an imperative, but this is its meaning) <span class= "ital">to set him at rest, even Israel.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people</span> which were <span class="cmt_word">left of the sword,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">the people of those left of the sword.</span> The expression clearly implies that the Jews at the time spoken of had escaped, or were about to escape, in some great battle or some other kind of slaughter. Hence the finding grace in the wilderness cannot refer to the sequel of the passage through the Red Sea, and we must perforce explain it of the second great deliverance, viz. from the Babylonian exile. This view is strongly confirmed by <a href="/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, where the Israelites who escape the predicted slaughter at Babylon are called "escaped ones from the sword," and exhorted to remember Jehovah and Jerusalem "afar off." The "wilderness" of the present passage, like the "afar off" of ch. 51. (and of the next verse) seems to mean Babylon, which was, by comparison with the highly favoured Judah, a "barren and dry land" (comp. <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), a spiritual Arabia. It may be objected that the tense here is the perfect; but there is abundance of analogy for explaining it as the prophetic perfect. The restoration of the chosen people to favour is as certain in the Divine counsels as if it were already an event past. (It seems less appropriate to understand "the wilderness" of the country which separated Assyria from Palestine. It was in Babylon that the covenant of Sinai was renewed to God's repentant people.) <span class="cmt_word">Even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest;</span> rather, <span class="accented">when I went to cause Israel to rest</span> (literally, <span class="accented">to cause him</span> - <span class="accented">Israel</span> - <span class="accented">to rest</span>; but the pleonastic pronoun need not be represented in the English). Another possible and perhaps preferable rendering is, <span class="accented">I will go to cause</span>, etc. "Rest" could only be had in the consciousness of God's favor. With all the outward property of many of the Jews in Babylon, there was no true "rest."
