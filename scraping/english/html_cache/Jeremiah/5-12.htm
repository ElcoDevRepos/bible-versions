In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, the Israelites often turned to false prophets who assured them of peace and safety despite their disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme where God's people are warned against false teachings (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). The act of lying about the LORD is a serious offense, as it distorts the truth of His nature and His covenant promises.<p><b>and said: &#8220;He will not do anything;</b><br>This reflects a common attitude of complacency and disbelief in divine intervention. The Israelites, influenced by false prophets, believed that God would not act against them despite their sins. This mirrors the skepticism found in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>, where scoffers doubt the coming judgment. Historically, this attitude was prevalent during times of prosperity when people felt secure in their own strength and resources, neglecting their dependence on God.<p><b>harm will not come to us;</b><br>The false assurance of safety is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. The people of Judah believed they were immune to disaster, possibly due to their status as God's chosen people and the presence of the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>). This false sense of security is challenged by the prophets, who consistently warn that covenant unfaithfulness will lead to judgment (<a href="/amos/6.htm">Amos 6:1-7</a>).<p><b>we will not see sword or famine.</b><br>Sword and famine are common symbols of divine judgment in the Old Testament (<a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). The people&#8217;s denial of these potential calamities shows their rejection of prophetic warnings. Historically, these were real threats during Jeremiah's time, as the Babylonian Empire was expanding and threatening Judah. Theologically, this denial represents a rejection of the consequences of sin, which is a theme that runs throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for repentance and reliance on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
