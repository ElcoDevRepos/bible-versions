Vineyards often represent Israel in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is depicted as a vineyard that failed to produce good fruit. The command to "go up" suggests an invasion or attack, likely by foreign nations as instruments of God's judgment. Historically, this aligns with the Babylonian invasions that led to the exile. The act of ravaging implies a thorough destruction, yet it is controlled and purposeful, reflecting God's sovereignty in judgment.<p><b>but do not finish them off</b><br>This phrase shows God's mercy even in judgment. While the vineyards are to be ravaged, they are not to be completely destroyed. This restraint indicates a remnant will be preserved, a recurring theme in prophetic literature (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). It reflects God's covenant faithfulness and His plan for restoration. Theologically, it points to the hope of redemption and the continuation of God's promises to His people, ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<p><b>Strip off her branches</b><br>The branches represent the people of Judah who have turned away from God. Stripping them off signifies the removal of those who are unfaithful, akin to pruning a vine to promote future growth. This imagery is consistent with <a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>, where Jesus speaks of pruning branches to bear more fruit. The act of stripping is both a judgment and a preparation for renewal, emphasizing the need for repentance and purification.<p><b>for they do not belong to the LORD</b><br>This phrase highlights the spiritual state of the people. Despite being part of God's chosen nation, their actions and hearts have distanced them from Him. This separation is a result of idolatry and injustice, as detailed throughout Jeremiah. Theologically, it underscores the importance of true belonging to God, not just by heritage but through faith and obedience. It foreshadows the New Covenant, where belonging to God is defined by a relationship with Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-6.htm">Romans 9:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Now He commands the invaders to &#8220;go up,&#8221; signaling that the time of harvest for judgment has come.<p>&#8226; This upward movement recalls how enemies &#8220;came up&#8221; against the land in earlier chastisements (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The imagery tells us God still owns the field; He directs what happens within it, underlining His sovereign right to discipline His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and ravage them</b><p>&#8220;Ravage&#8221; points to deliberate, overwhelming devastation&#8212;far more than a casual pruning.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah watches Babylon fulfill this word (<a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s holiness demands He confront persistent rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/4-18.htm">Jeremiah 4:18</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the action is under strict divine orders; nothing occurs outside His control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but do not finish them off</b><p>Grace shines through.

He commands invading forces to climb the terraces, break down the unfaithful vines, and remove fruitless branches&#8212;yet He forbids total destruction. The passage reveals both the severity of divine judgment against persistent sin and the steadfast mercy that preserves a remnant. The same God who uproots what is corrupt also keeps alive what can yet be fruitful, inviting His people to renewed faithfulness under His rightful ownership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Walls.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">her palm-trees. </span>The Hebrew word is found in <a href="/ezekiel/27-25.htm" title="The ships of Tarshish did sing of you in your market: and you were replenished, and made very glorious in the middle of the seas.">Ezekiel 27:25</a>, though not in the English Version, in the sense of "mast," and here, apparently, means the tall, stately trunk of the palmtree.

The rendering "walls," still adopted by some commentators, may refer to the "walls" of a vineyard, but the second word would in that case be the <span class= "ital">tendrils </span>of the vine. Both the palm-tree and the vine appear on Maccabean coins as symbols of Judah, and the latter had been treated as such in <a href="/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well beloved has a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/80-8.htm" title="You have brought a vine out of Egypt: you have cast out the heathen, and planted it.">Psalm 80:8-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-18.</span> - Provoked by the open unbelief of the men of Judah, Jehovah repeats his warning of a sore judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her walls</span>. There is a doubt about "walls," which should, as some think, rather be <span class="accented">vine-rows</span> (a change of points is involved; also of shin into sin - the slightest of all changes), or shoots, or branches (comparing the Syriac). The figure would thus gain somewhat in symmetry. However, all the ancient interpreters (whose authority, overrated by some, still counts for something) explain the word as in the Authorized Version, and, as Graf remarks, in order to destroy the vines, it' would be necessary to climb up upon the walls of the vineyard. (For the figure of the vine or the vineyard, scrap, on Jeremiah 2:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Take away... not the Lord's</span>. The Septuagint and Peshito read differently, translating "leave her foundations, for they are the <span class="accented">Lord's"</span> (supposing the figure be taken from a building).
