It reflects the generational nature of sin, where practices and beliefs are passed down, often without question. This is reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated cycles of disobedience throughout the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10-12</a>, where a new generation arose that did not know the Lord.<p><b>that shameful god</b><br>The "shameful god" likely refers to Baal or other Canaanite deities that Israel frequently turned to, despite God's commands against idolatry. These gods were associated with fertility and prosperity but were ultimately powerless and led to Israel's spiritual and moral decline. The term "shameful" underscores the disgrace and futility of worshiping false gods, as seen in <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, where Israel's idolatry is likened to the shame of their ancestors.<p><b>has consumed what our fathers have worked for</b><br>Idolatry is depicted as a consuming force, devouring the fruits of labor and the blessings God intended for His people. This consumption can be understood both literally, in terms of economic loss, and spiritually, as it leads to a loss of divine favor and protection. The imagery of consumption is echoed in <a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>, where the people's efforts are unproductive because they have neglected God.<p><b>their flocks and herds</b><br>Flocks and herds were vital to the agrarian economy of ancient Israel, representing wealth, sustenance, and God's provision. The loss of these resources due to idolatry signifies not only economic ruin but also a breach in the covenant relationship with God, who promised to bless their livestock if they remained faithful (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). This loss is a direct consequence of turning away from God.<p><b>their sons and daughters</b><br>The mention of sons and daughters highlights the severe impact of idolatry on families and future generations. In some cases, this may allude to the horrific practice of child sacrifice associated with certain pagan rituals, as condemned in <a href="/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>. It also signifies the spiritual and moral corruption that affects children when parents stray from God's commandments, emphasizing the importance of teaching and living out faith as instructed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often warned by prophets like Jeremiah about their idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shameful_god.htm">Shameful god</a></b><br>Refers to the idols and false gods that the people of Judah worshipped, leading them away from the true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers.htm">Fathers</a></b><br>The ancestors of the people of Judah, who had worked hard to provide for their families and maintain their heritage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/flocks_and_herds.htm">Flocks and Herds</a></b><br>Represents the wealth and livelihood of the people, which were squandered due to idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to the loss of what is valuable, both materially and spiritually.

The words point accordingly to the prodigal waste of victims, possibly of human life also, in the worship of Baal and that of Molech, which in the prophet's mind was identified with it, and which had brought with it nothing but a lasting shame. This also forms part of the confession of the repentant people (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For shame</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> Shame (i.e. the Baal).
