In the ancient Near East, temples were central to religious and cultural life, and the destruction of these places symbolized the defeat of the gods they housed. The imagery of fire suggests total destruction and purification, a common biblical theme (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>). Historically, Egypt was known for its pantheon of gods, and this prophecy underscores the futility of relying on false deities.<p><b>and Nebuchadnezzar will burn those temples and take their gods as captives</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, is depicted as an instrument of God's judgment. The act of burning temples and taking gods captive signifies the humiliation and impotence of Egypt's deities. This reflects the historical practice of conquering kings who would often carry off idols to demonstrate their superiority (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>). It also highlights the sovereignty of the God of Israel over all nations and their gods.<p><b>So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment</b><br>This metaphor illustrates Nebuchadnezzar's complete domination over Egypt. Just as a shepherd casually wraps himself in his garment, Nebuchadnezzar will effortlessly take control of Egypt. The shepherd imagery is significant in biblical literature, often used to describe leadership and care (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>). Here, it emphasizes the ease and totality of Babylon's conquest.<p><b>and he will depart from there unscathed</b><br>This phrase assures that Nebuchadnezzar will face no harm in his campaign against Egypt. It underscores the certainty of the prophecy and the protection afforded to him as God's chosen instrument of judgment. Historically, this reflects the successful military campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar, who expanded Babylon's influence without significant setbacks. Theologically, it reinforces the theme of divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and other nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, who is prophesied to conquer Egypt and demonstrate God's sovereignty over the nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant nation in biblical history, often representing worldly power and opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temples_of_the_gods_of_egypt.htm">Temples of the gods of Egypt</a></b><br>These represent the idolatrous practices and false gods that Egypt worshipped, which God promises to destroy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherd_metaphor.htm">Shepherd metaphor</a></b><br>This imagery is used to describe Nebuchadnezzar's effortless conquest and control over Egypt, symbolizing God's control over the situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and their leaders.

To take possession of the whole country will be as quick and light a matter as when the shepherd takes up his garment at night and wraps it round him.

The prophet speaks from the point of view of a believer in the idol gods. <span class="cmt_word">He shall array himself with the land of Egypt,</span> etc. (For "array himself with" and "putteth on,"<span class="accented">read wrap himself in</span> and <span class="accented">wrappeth himself in.</span>) Ewald well explains this figure. "As easily as the shepherd in the open field wraps himself in the cool night in his mantle, will he be able to grasp Egypt with his hand and fling it round him like an easily managed garment, in order then to leave the land as an absolute conqueror, clothed in this attire of booty, in peace, without an enemy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/43-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will kindle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7779;&#183;&#7779;at&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
