The "hands of those who seek their lives" refers to the Babylonian forces, emphasizing the inevitability of divine judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of His judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria and <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a> with the Chaldeans.<p><b>of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers.</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar was the powerful ruler of Babylon, known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire. His officers were skilled leaders who executed his commands, making Babylon a dominant force in the ancient Near East. This historical context underscores the seriousness of the threat to Egypt. The mention of Nebuchadnezzar connects to other biblical narratives, such as the fall of Jerusalem in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>, highlighting the fulfillment of God's prophetic word through Jeremiah.<p><b>But after this, Egypt will be inhabited as in days of old,</b><br>This phrase offers a glimpse of hope and restoration, suggesting that Egypt's desolation will not be permanent. The promise of future habitation "as in days of old" indicates a return to stability and normalcy. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where judgment is followed by restoration, as seen in the prophecies concerning Israel in <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/36-33.htm">Ezekiel 36:33-36</a>. It also highlights God's sovereignty over nations, orchestrating history according to His purposes.<p><b>declares the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "declares the LORD" affirms the divine authority and certainty of the prophecy. It emphasizes that these events are not merely historical accidents but are orchestrated by God Himself. This assurance is a common feature in prophetic literature, underscoring the reliability of God's word, as seen in similar declarations throughout the book of Jeremiah (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-8.htm">Jeremiah 1:8, 4</a>:9).

God sometimes permits hostile powers to rise so that proud nations learn that &#8220;the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the earlier prophecy against Egypt in <a href="/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10&#8211;13</a>, this judgment fulfills promises made generations before (<a href="/genesis/15-14.htm">Genesis 15:14</a>, <a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>), proving that no word of God ever falls to the ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers</b><p>&#8226; The Lord names His chosen instrument: &#8220;Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>).

Egypt was to revive, though not again to take its place among the conquerors and tyrants of the world. (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-39.htm" title="But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 49:39</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Afterward it shall be inhabited,</span> etc. After all these gloomy vaticinations, Jeremiah (as elsewhere in this group of prophecies; see <a href="/jeremiah/48-47.htm">Jeremiah 48:47</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6, 39</a>) opens up a brighter prospect. "In the days of old," patriarchal and unmilitary, the fertile valley of the Nile offered a peaceful and a happy home to its teeming inhabitants; those times shall yet come again. To understand this, we must assume that during its period of depression Egypt has been but sparsely peopled, owing to the large numbers of its inhabitants carried away captive. Another explanation, "afterwards Egypt shall stay at home [i.e, 'be quiet']," though equally justifiable item the point of view of the lexicon (comp. <a href="/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/55-7.htm">Psalm 55:7</a>), seems less natural. Possibly <a href="/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-16</a> is a development of our passage; it contains a promise of future remission of punishment, though a promise qualified in such a way as to be akin to a threat. The words, "And it shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel" (<a href="/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>), seem like a comment on Jeremiah's threat to "Pharaoh, and them that trust in him," in the preceding verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/46-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will hand them over to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1456;&#1514;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7791;at&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
