His lineage, being the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah, suggests a family of some standing, possibly with priestly or noble connections. Baruch's role as a scribe is crucial, as scribes were responsible for recording and preserving important documents. This act of giving the deed signifies the formal and legal transfer of property, emphasizing the importance of written records in ancient Judah. Baruch's involvement highlights his loyalty and the trust Jeremiah placed in him, as he would later be responsible for writing down Jeremiah's prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>).<p><b>in the sight of my cousin Hanamel</b><br>Hanamel, Jeremiah's cousin, is the one from whom Jeremiah purchases the field in Anathoth. This transaction is significant as it fulfills the law of redemption found in <a href="/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>, where a family member has the right to redeem property to keep it within the family. The presence of Hanamel underscores the familial and legal aspects of the transaction, reinforcing the idea of hope and restoration for the people of Judah, even as they face impending exile.<p><b>and the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement</b><br>The presence of witnesses was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern legal transactions to ensure the legitimacy and future validation of the agreement. These witnesses would have been respected members of the community, whose testimony could be relied upon if the transaction were ever disputed. This practice is consistent with other biblical accounts, such as <a href="/ruth/4-9.htm">Ruth 4:9-11</a>, where Boaz redeems land in the presence of witnesses. The signing of the purchase agreement further emphasizes the formal and binding nature of the transaction.<p><b>and all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard</b><br>The courtyard of the guard was a place where Jeremiah was held during the siege of Jerusalem, indicating that this transaction took place under challenging circumstances. The presence of "all the Jews" suggests a public setting, where the transaction could be witnessed by many, adding to its authenticity and transparency. This setting also reflects the dire situation in Jerusalem, as the city was under threat from Babylonian forces. Despite the bleak circumstances, Jeremiah's purchase of the field serves as a prophetic act of hope, symbolizing God's promise of restoration and the eventual return of the exiles to their land (<a href="/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is instructed by God to buy a field as a sign of hope for Israel's future restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch_son_of_neriah.htm">Baruch son of Neriah</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe and trusted companion, who is given the deed of purchase.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hanamel.htm">Hanamel</a></b><br>Jeremiah's cousin, from whom Jeremiah buys the field in Anathoth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals present to validate the transaction, ensuring its legality and authenticity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/courtyard_of_the_guard.htm">Courtyard of the Guard</a></b><br>The location where Jeremiah was confined, and where the transaction took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Jeremiah's purchase of the field is a tangible demonstration of faith in God's promises.

Nothing is known of his father or grandfather, but the fact that both are named indicates that he belonged to the nobler families of Judah; and this is confirmed, partly by the fact that his brother Seraiah (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm" title="The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.">Jeremiah 51:59</a>, where see Note) held a high position in the court of Zedekiah, partly by Josephus, who describes him as of "a very illustrious house," and "highly educated" (<span class= "ital">Ant. </span>x. 6, ? 12). The mention of Chelcias (the Greek form for Hilkiah) among his ancestors, in the apocryphal book that bears his name (<a href="//apocrypha.org/baruch/1-1.htm" title="And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,">Baruch 1:1</a>), may indicate a connection with the family of the high-priest in the reign of Josiah (<a href="/context/2_kings/22-4.htm" title="Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:">2Kings 22:4-14</a>), and we may find in this fact an explanation of his regard tor Jeremiah. In relation to the prophet, he appears in <a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm" title="Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book.">Jeremiah 36:4</a> as acting as his secretary, as accused of instigating Jeremiah to preach submission to the Chaldaeans (<a href="/jeremiah/43-3.htm" title="But Baruch the son of Neriah sets you on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.">Jeremiah 43:3</a>), as sharing his sufferings and dangers (<a href="/jeremiah/36-26.htm" title="But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.">Jeremiah 36:26</a>), and, according to Josephus (as above), as thrown into prison with him. He was probably an influential member of the Chaldaean party in the court of Judah, protesting against the policy which courted an alliance with Egypt and entered into intrigues and schemes of rebellion against the power of Babylon. The book that bears his name is probably pseudonymous, but it bears witness, in the very fact of its being ascribed to him, to the importance of the position which he occupied in the politics of the time. Here he is present as at least visiting the prophet in prison, even if he did not share his imprisonment, and Jeremiah hands over the deeds of conveyance to his custody. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and I gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1438;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;et&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
