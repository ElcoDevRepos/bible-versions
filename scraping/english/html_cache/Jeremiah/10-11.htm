It emphasizes the role of the prophet as a messenger who conveys God's words to the people. In the context of Jeremiah's ministry, he often addressed the idolatry and false worship prevalent in Judah. This command underscores the authority of God's message over human traditions and false beliefs.<p><b>These gods, who have made neither the heavens nor the earth:</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the impotence and falsehood of the idols worshipped by the nations surrounding Israel. Unlike the God of Israel, who is the Creator of all things (<a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>), these so-called gods have no power or authority over creation. This distinction is crucial in the biblical narrative, as it sets the God of Israel apart from all other deities. The reference to creation also connects to passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24</a>, where God declares His role as the sole Creator.<p><b>will perish from this earth and from under these heavens:</b><br>This phrase prophesies the ultimate downfall and destruction of idols and false gods. It reflects the biblical theme of God's judgment against idolatry, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/2-18.htm">Isaiah 2:18-21</a>, where idols are cast away during the day of the Lord. The mention of "this earth" and "under these heavens" emphasizes the comprehensive scope of God's judgment, affecting all creation. This also foreshadows the eschatological promise of a new heaven and a new earth, where only the true God will be worshipped (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often warned by prophets like Jeremiah about impending judgment due to idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols/gods.htm">Idols/Gods</a></b><br>Refers to the false gods worshiped by the nations surrounding Israel, which were made by human hands and had no real power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens_and_earth.htm">Heavens and Earth</a></b><br>The creation of the one true God, contrasting with the false gods who did not create anything.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The context in which Jeremiah prophesied, warning Judah of the consequences of their idolatry, which eventually led to their exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idols, being man-made, have no power or life.

It is not, like the rest of the book, in Hebrew, but in Chaldee or Aramaic, the language of the enemies of Israel. Two explanations have been offered--(1) that a marginal note, added by one of the exiles in Babylon, found its way at a later period into the text; (2) a far more probable view, viz., that the prophet, whose intercourse with the Chaldeans had made him familiar with their language, put into the mouths of his own countrymen the answer they were to give when they were invited to join in the worship of their conquerors. Little as they might know of the strange language, they might learn enough to give this answer. The words have the ring of a kind of popular proverb, and in the original there is a play of sound which can only be faintly reproduced in English--<span class= "ital">The gods that have not made<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span> <span class= "ital">they shall be made away with. </span>The apocryphal Epistle of Jeremiah, already referred to, may, perhaps, be regarded as a rhetorical sermon on this text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall ye say</span>, etc. This verse is, unlike the rest of the chapter, written in Chaldee, and greatly interrupts the connection. Whether it is a fragment of a Targum (or Chaldee paraphrase) representing a Hebrew verse really written by Jeremiah, or whether it is a marginal note by some scribe or reader which has found its way by accident into the text, cannot be positively determined. What is certain is that it is not in its right place, though it already stood here when the Septuagint Version of Jeremiah was made. To argue, with the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the latter circumstance is decisive of the correctness of the passage in its present position, implies a view of the unchangeableness of the text in the early centuries which few leading scholars will admit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thus</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ki&#7695;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
