This reflects the political structure of ancient Judah, where the king often relied on the counsel of his officials. Historically, these officials were often more concerned with political stability and their own power than with spiritual or prophetic truth. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where leaders sought to silence prophets, such as in the cases of Elijah and Micaiah.<p><b>&#8220;This man ought to die</b><br>The call for Jeremiah's death highlights the severe opposition prophets often faced when delivering God's messages. This reflects a recurring theme in the Bible where true prophets are persecuted for speaking God's truth, as seen with prophets like Isaiah and later with John the Baptist. It also foreshadows the ultimate rejection and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was also condemned by religious leaders for His teachings.<p><b>for he is discouraging the warriors who remain in this city</b><br>Jeremiah's message was one of surrender to the Babylonians, which was seen as demoralizing to the soldiers defending Jerusalem. This reflects the tension between faithfulness to God's word and the perceived need for national defense. The discouragement of warriors can be compared to the fear and dismay seen in other biblical battles where faith was tested, such as the story of Gideon.<p><b>as well as all the people</b><br>Jeremiah's influence extended beyond the military to the general populace, indicating his significant role as a prophet. His message was intended to lead the people to repentance and trust in God's plan, even when it seemed counterintuitive. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's ways being higher than human ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>by speaking such words to them</b><br>The words Jeremiah spoke were directly from God, emphasizing the role of the prophet as God's mouthpiece. This phrase underscores the power of spoken words in the biblical narrative, where words can bring life or death, blessing or curse. It also highlights the responsibility of the prophet to speak truth, regardless of the consequences.<p><b>this man is not seeking the well-being of these people</b><br>The officials accused Jeremiah of not having the people's best interests at heart, which was a misinterpretation of his prophetic mission. This accusation is reminiscent of the way Jesus was misunderstood and accused of being against the people, despite His mission to save them. It highlights the theme of true well-being being found in obedience to God, rather than in human plans.<p><b>but their ruin.&#8221;</b><br>The officials believed Jeremiah's message would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem, not realizing that ignoring his message would actually bring about their ruin. This reflects the biblical principle that true safety and prosperity come from following God's will, even when it seems contrary to human wisdom. It also serves as a prophetic warning of the coming destruction of Jerusalem, which ultimately occurred because of the people's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Within the last few weeks he had been thrown into a loathsome dungeon, from which the king had but just delivered him. Now they press for a yet severer sentence. The weak king, conscious of his want of power to resist, yields a reluctant consent. The whole history reminds us of Pilate's conduct in circumstances more or less analogous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thus;</span> <span class="accented">literally, for therefore</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because he is left in impunity (camp. the use of the phrase in <a href="/jeremiah/29-28.htm">Jeremiah 29:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He weakeneth the hands of the men of war;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he dispirits them. It is important to get this "outside view" of the preaching of Jeremiah. There is evidently some excuse for the opponents of Jeremiah. It was a matter of life and death to resist the Chaldeans, and Jeremiah was, according to the politicians, playing into the hands of the enemy (see further in general Introduction). The addition of the words, that remain, shows that the bitter end of the resistance was fast approaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the officials</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
