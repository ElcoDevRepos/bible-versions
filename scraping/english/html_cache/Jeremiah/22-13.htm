In the context of ancient Judah, this likely refers to King Jehoiakim, who was known for his oppressive reign. The term "woe" is a prophetic declaration of impending judgment, often used by prophets to signal divine displeasure. The construction of a "palace" symbolizes the accumulation of wealth and power, often at the expense of others. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's concern for justice and righteousness, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-10</a>, where similar judgments are pronounced against those who exploit others for personal gain.<p><b>and his upper rooms without justice</b><br>The "upper rooms" signify luxury and status, often built to display wealth and power. In ancient Near Eastern architecture, these rooms were typically reserved for the elite. The lack of "justice" in their construction highlights the moral corruption of leaders who prioritize personal comfort over fairness and equity. This reflects the biblical principle that true leadership is marked by justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>, which states that a king establishes a country by justice.<p><b>who makes his countrymen serve without pay</b><br>This phrase addresses the exploitation of laborers, a violation of the Mosaic Law, which required fair treatment and timely payment of workers (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>). The forced labor of fellow countrymen without compensation is a grave injustice, reflecting a broader societal breakdown where the powerful oppress the weak. This exploitation is reminiscent of the Israelites' own experience in Egypt, where they were forced to serve without pay, highlighting the hypocrisy of those who now oppress their own people.<p><b>and fails to pay their wages</b><br>The failure to pay wages is a direct violation of God's commands and an affront to His character, which is just and righteous. This phrase underscores the importance of economic justice and the ethical treatment of workers, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture. <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a> echoes this sentiment, warning that the cries of the unpaid laborers have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. This serves as a reminder that God is attentive to the plight of the oppressed and will hold accountable those who perpetrate injustice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often warned by prophets like Jeremiah about their disobedience and injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jehoiakim.htm">King Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The likely subject of this verse, known for his oppressive reign and disregard for justice, as he built his palace with forced labor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers of God who were sent to call the people back to righteousness and justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>Symbolic of the structures and systems built on injustice and exploitation, representing broader societal issues.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_for_justice.htm">The Call for Justice</a></b><br>God demands justice in all our dealings.

The feelings of the people, already suffering from the miseries of foreign invasion, were outraged by the revival of the forced labour of the days of Solomon, pressing in this instance not on the "strangers" of alien blood (<a href="/context/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1Kings 5:13-15</a>; <a href="/context/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17-18</a>), but on the Israelites themselves. We are reminded of the general characteristics of Eastern, and perhaps of all other, despotism. Like the modern rulers of Constantinople, Jehoiakim went on building palaces when his kingdom was on the verge of ruin, and his subjects were groaning under their burdens.<p><span class= "bld">His chambers.</span>--Strictly speaking, the upper storeys of the house.

He "had, besides, a passion for building splendid and costly houses; and as he esteemed his own position secure under the protection of a superior power, he did not scruple severely to oppress his helpless subjects, and wring from them as much money as possible" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' 4:252; see <a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-35</a>).
