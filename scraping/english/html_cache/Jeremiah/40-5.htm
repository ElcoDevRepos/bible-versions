This moment signifies a turning point in his life, as he is given the choice to decide his next steps. The phrase indicates a pause, suggesting divine intervention or guidance in his decision-making process.<p><b>Nebuzaradan added</b><br>Nebuzaradan was the captain of the Babylonian guard, a high-ranking official under King Nebuchadnezzar. His role in the narrative highlights the fulfillment of God's prophecy regarding the Babylonian conquest and the subsequent treatment of Jeremiah, who was respected by the Babylonians despite being a prisoner.<p><b>&#8220;Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan</b><br>Gedaliah was appointed governor over the remnant in Judah by the Babylonians. His lineage is significant; Ahikam had protected Jeremiah earlier (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), and Shaphan was a scribe during King Josiah's reign, involved in the discovery of the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3-14</a>). This connection underscores a continuity of faithfulness to God amidst political upheaval.<p><b>whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah</b><br>The appointment of Gedaliah by the Babylonian king reflects the political strategy of the Babylonians to maintain control over conquered territories by installing local leaders. This appointment also fulfills Jeremiah's prophecies about the Babylonian exile and the governance of Judah under foreign rule (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6-7</a>).<p><b>and stay with him among the people</b><br>Jeremiah is encouraged to remain with the remnant of Judah, symbolizing his ongoing role as a spiritual leader and prophet to the people. This phrase emphasizes the importance of community and leadership in times of crisis, as well as the prophet's continued mission.<p><b>or go anywhere else that seems right</b><br>Jeremiah is given the freedom to choose his path, highlighting the respect and trust the Babylonians had for him. This choice reflects the broader theme of free will and divine guidance, as Jeremiah's decisions are ultimately aligned with God's purposes.<p><b>Then the captain of the guard gave him a ration and a gift and released him</b><br>The provision of a ration and a gift signifies respect and honor, unusual treatment for a captive. This act of kindness by Nebuzaradan can be seen as God's provision for Jeremiah, ensuring his well-being as he continues his prophetic ministry.

Freedom was literally one step away when the captain paused him. This moment underlines how God can insert fresh direction even when we think a chapter is closed (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s willingness to wait reflects his lifelong obedience to the Lord&#8217;s timing (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7-8</a>; 37:13-14).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nebuzaradan added</b><p>Nebuzaradan, though a pagan officer, shows remarkable respect for the prophet, echoing how Nebuchadnezzar had earlier charged him to protect Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-11.htm">Jeremiah 39:11-12</a>). God can move the hearts of authorities to favor His servants (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>). The extra word from Nebuzaradan highlights God&#8217;s providence: Jeremiah is not merely released; he is guided.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam</b><p>Gedaliah&#8217;s appointment (<a href="/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22</a>) is more than political; it fulfills God&#8217;s promise to leave &#8220;a remnant&#8221; in the land (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>). Gedaliah&#8217;s father Ahikam had once shielded Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-24.htm">Jeremiah 26:24</a>), so the invitation places the prophet under a family historically friendly to his ministry. The Lord often provides relationships that guard His messengers (<a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stay with him among the people</b><p>Remaining with the remnant aligned with Jeremiah&#8217;s own message: submit to Babylon and live (<a href="/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>; 29:4-7). By staying, Jeremiah would pastor those left behind, modeling faithfulness when circumstances look bleak (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or go anywhere else that seems right</b><p>Nebuzaradan grants genuine choice: &#8220;go anywhere else that seems right.&#8221; Free will sits beside God&#8217;s sovereignty; the Lord opens doors yet leaves His servant to walk through the one he judges best (<a href="/jeremiah/21-8.htm">Jeremiah 21:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).

Release completes the promise of protection made in <a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20-21</a>. What looked like defeat for Judah becomes personal deliverance for Jeremiah; divine faithfulness shines brightest in crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a> shows God steering events for His prophet even through foreign officers. The verse highlights (1) God&#8217;s precise timing, (2) unexpected channels of favor, (3) care for the remnant through a trusted governor, (4) the balance of divine guidance and human choice, and (5) tangible provision. Jeremiah&#8217;s story reassures believers that the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty and love are unbroken, even in the aftermath of national judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span>--The captain of the guard seems to have felt, on second thoughts, possibly after hearing the prophet's unrecorded answer, that he had not taken sufficient precaution for Jeremiah's safety, and therefore consigns him once more to the care of his friend and protector. On parting with him he treats him as an honoured guest, sends him a portion of food from his own table (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/52-34.htm" title="And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.">Jeremiah 52:34</a>)--a welcome gift, doubtless, after the privations of the siege--and an <span class= "ital">honorarium, </span>in money as a compensation for the sufferings he had undergone as a preacher of submission to the conqueror.<p><span class= "bld">Governor over the cities of Judah.</span>--The official title is significant. Jerusalem is treated as if it had been blotted from the face of the earth, and required no superintendence. Gedaliah, the prophet's friend, had obviously acted on his counsels, and accepted the sovereignty of Nebuchadnezzar as being for the time the ordinance of God. A true patriot might well hold it to be his duty at such a time to accept office under the conqueror, in the hope of being able to do something for the remnant of the nation that was left under his charge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/40.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now while he was not yet,</span> etc. This rendering, however, seems against the Hebrew usage.
