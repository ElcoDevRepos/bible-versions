The prophets served as God's messengers, delivering His words and warnings. This reflects God's patience and desire for His people to return to Him. Historically, prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were sent during times of moral and spiritual decline. The repeated sending of prophets underscores the seriousness of the message and God's commitment to His covenant with Israel.<p><b>Proclaiming: &#8216;Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways, and correct your actions.</b><br>The call to "turn" is a call to repentance, a central theme in the prophetic messages. Repentance involves a change of heart and behavior, turning away from sin and returning to God. The phrase "wicked ways" refers to the moral and spiritual corruption prevalent in Judah at the time. This call to correct actions is consistent with the covenantal requirements found in the Law of Moses, where obedience leads to blessing and disobedience to curse.<p><b>Do not go after other gods to serve them.</b><br>Idolatry was a persistent issue for Israel and Judah, often leading them away from the worship of Yahweh. The command not to serve other gods is rooted in the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The allure of surrounding nations' gods often led Israel into syncretism, which was a direct violation of their covenant with God. This phrase highlights the exclusivity of worship that God demands and the spiritual adultery that idolatry represents.<p><b>Live in the land that I have given to you and your fathers.</b><br>The land was a significant part of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It was a tangible sign of God's covenant and blessing. Living in the land was contingent upon obedience to God's commands. The historical context here is crucial, as the threat of exile loomed due to the people's disobedience. The land was not just a physical inheritance but a place where God's people were to live out their covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>But you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me.</b><br>This phrase indicates the people's stubbornness and refusal to heed God's warnings. "Inclining the ear" is a metaphor for attentiveness and obedience. The repeated failure to listen to God through His prophets led to severe consequences, including the Babylonian exile. This reflects a broader biblical theme of the hardness of heart and the consequences of ignoring God's voice. The call to listen is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus often says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>Servants of God sent repeatedly to deliver His messages, urging the people to turn from their sinful ways.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's message, who were repeatedly warned but failed to heed God's call.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land given to the Israelites, symbolizing God's covenant and blessings contingent on obedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_gods.htm">False Gods</a></b><br>Represents the idolatry and false worship practices that the people of Judah were engaging in, contrary to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_persistence_of_god's_call.htm">The Persistence of God's Call</a></b><br>God repeatedly sends His prophets, demonstrating His patience and desire for His people to return to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves turning away from evil and correcting one's actions, not just feeling remorse.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Following other gods leads to spiritual and often physical destruction, as it breaks the covenant relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_god's_word.htm">Listening to God's Word</a></b><br>Inclining our ear to God's message is crucial; ignoring it leads to missed blessings and potential judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_blessings_and_responsibilities.htm">Covenant Blessings and Responsibilities</a></b><br>Living in the land and receiving God's blessings are contingent upon obedience to His commands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_35_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 35:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_35_15_God_s_patient_calls.htm">How does Jeremiah 35:15 emphasize God's patience and repeated calls for repentance?
