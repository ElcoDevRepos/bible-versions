In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a>, the officials are responding to the reading of the scroll containing Jeremiah's prophecies. The urgency reflects the gravity of the message, as the prophecies often contained warnings of impending judgment. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where individuals seek immediate understanding of divine messages, such as in <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>, when the crowd asks Peter what they should do after hearing his sermon.<p><b>they asked Baruch,</b><br>Baruch was Jeremiah's scribe and faithful companion. His role as a scribe was crucial in the ancient world, where literacy was not widespread. Baruch's involvement highlights the importance of written records in preserving God's word. This is similar to the role of other scribes in the Bible, such as Ezra, who was also a scribe and priest (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>). Baruch's loyalty and service to Jeremiah are reminiscent of the supportive roles seen in other biblical partnerships, like that of Aaron to Moses.<p><b>&#8220;how did you write all these words?</b><br>The officials are inquiring about the process of recording the prophecies. This question underscores the importance of authenticity and accuracy in transmitting God's word. In the ancient Near East, scribes were responsible for ensuring the precise copying of texts. This concern for accuracy is echoed in the New Testament, where Paul emphasizes the importance of sound doctrine and faithful transmission of the gospel (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p><b>Was it at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation?&#8221;</b><br>This question seeks to confirm the source of the message, emphasizing the authority of Jeremiah as a prophet. Dictation was a common method for prophets to convey God's messages, ensuring that the words were not altered by personal interpretation. This method is seen in other prophetic writings, such as when God instructs Moses to write down His words (<a href="/exodus/34-27.htm">Exodus 34:27</a>). The reliance on dictation highlights the divine origin of the message, pointing to the inspiration of Scripture as affirmed in <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>, where it states that prophecy comes from God as men spoke from the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>The scribe and faithful companion of the prophet Jeremiah.

Their urgent &#8220;Tell us now&#8221; shows a seriousness that contrasts with King Jehoiakim&#8217;s later contempt (<a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22&#8211;24</a>). Scripture often portrays such immediate calls for explanation when God&#8217;s word pierces hearts&#8212;think of <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a> (&#8220;Brothers, what shall we do?&#8221;) and <a href="/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30</a>. Like those moments, the officials sense that timely obedience cannot be postponed (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked Baruch</b><p>Attention turns from the prophet to his scribe. Baruch, though lesser known, has already proven faithful (<a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12-16</a>; 45:1-5). His presence reminds us that God often uses supporting servants to preserve and transmit revelation&#8212;Joshua for Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>), Jonathan&#8217;s armor-bearer (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-7</a>), Silas writing with Peter (<a href="/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). The officials recognize Baruch&#8217;s firsthand knowledge, treating him as a trustworthy witness (<a href="/proverbs/14-25.htm">Proverbs 14:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>how did you write all these words?</b><p>The question shows awe at the quantity and precision of the scroll. It echoes earlier commands: &#8220;Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>). Similar directives appear with Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-27.htm">Exodus 34:27</a>) and John (<a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>).<p>- The phrase underscores verbal inspiration: God&#8217;s words, not human opinion (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p>- It highlights preservation&#8212;ink on parchment ensures that truth endures beyond the speaker&#8217;s voice (<a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>).<p>- It prepares for public accountability; once written, the message can be read, reread, and verified (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was it at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation?</b><p>They need assurance that the scroll carries prophetic authority. Dictation affirms:<p>- Source: &#8220;The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1-2</a>).<p>- Process: &#8220;Jeremiah dictated all the words&#8230;the LORD had spoken&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>). This mirrors how Peter describes Scripture: &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>) and Paul&#8217;s &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>).<p>- Implication: If the words are truly Jeremiah&#8217;s (and thus the LORD&#8217;s), the officials must act. Ignoring them will bring judgment, just as Jehoiakim&#8217;s burning of the scroll does (<a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30-31</a>). Their inquiry is not academic; it is a life-and-death test of obedience (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-17.htm">Jeremiah 36:17</a> captures a decisive moment: officials urgently press Baruch to verify the divine origin of the scroll. Their question underlines three truths&#8212;God&#8217;s word demands immediate attention, He faithfully employs humble servants to record it, and its prophetic dictation carries unquestionable authority. How the hearers respond will determine blessing or judgment, then and now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17-19) <span class= "bld">Tell us now, How didst thou write . . .?</span>--The question was clearly put as a judicial interrogatory. The princes were anxious to ascertain how far each of the parties concerned was responsible. Had Baruch exercised any discretion in writing so that the words were his, though the substance was Jeremiah's? or had he, on his own responsibility, and without the prophet's will, published what had been written privately? or had every syllable as it was read come from the prophet's lips? The scribe's answer showed that the last hypothesis answered to the facts of the case. On hearing this they, obviously with a friendly regard, advise him and the prophet to hide themselves till they should see what effect the report would have on the king's mind. It would appear from <a href="/jeremiah/36-19.htm" title="Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you be.">Jeremiah 36:19</a> that Jeremiah, though "shut up" and unable to go into the house of the Lord (<a href="/jeremiah/36-5.htm" title="And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:">Jeremiah 36:5</a>), was not actually so imprisoned as to hinder him from concealing himself. Either, therefore, we must assume that he was in a "<span class= "ital">libera custodia,</span>" that gave him facilities for an escape, which the princes connived at, or that by "shut up" he meant only hindered by some cause or other. The latter seems the more probable hypothesis. In the concealment of the prophet we find a parallel to that of Elijah and the other prophets under Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm" title="Get you hence, and turn you eastward, and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.">1Kings 17:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1Kings 18:4</a>), of Polycarp (<span class= "ital">Mart.
