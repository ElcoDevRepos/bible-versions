His reign ended with the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem. The "them" refers to the Babylonian forces led by King Nebuchadnezzar, who had besieged Jerusalem. The flight of Zedekiah and his soldiers signifies the collapse of Judah's resistance and the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies regarding the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). This act of fleeing can be seen as a lack of faith and trust in God's protection, contrasting with the courage and faith shown by other biblical figures in times of distress.<p><b>They left the city at night by way of the king&#8217;s garden,</b><br>The king's garden was likely located near the southeastern part of Jerusalem, close to the Kidron Valley. Leaving at night suggests an attempt to escape unnoticed, indicating fear and desperation. The use of the king's garden as an escape route highlights the strategic planning involved, as gardens were often situated near city walls and water sources, providing a discreet exit. This escape attempt reflects the dire situation and the fulfillment of Jeremiah's warnings that Zedekiah would not succeed in evading capture (<a href="/jeremiah/38-18.htm">Jeremiah 38:18</a>).<p><b>through the gate between the two walls,</b><br>The "gate between the two walls" likely refers to a passageway in the fortifications of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence suggests that Jerusalem had multiple layers of walls, especially during times of siege. This specific gate might have been a lesser-known exit, used in emergencies. The mention of "two walls" underscores the city's fortified nature, yet even these defenses could not prevent the divine judgment pronounced by God through Jeremiah. The escape through this gate symbolizes the futility of relying on human defenses against God's decreed plans.<p><b>and they went out along the route to the Arabah.</b><br>The Arabah is a desert region stretching from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. This route was likely chosen for its remoteness, offering a potential path to safety away from the Babylonian forces. However, the choice of this route also fulfills the prophecy that Zedekiah would attempt to flee but would not escape (<a href="/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>). The Arabah's harsh conditions and the pursuit by Babylonian forces would make survival difficult, emphasizing the inevitability of God's judgment. This escape attempt can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual desolation that results from disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem.
