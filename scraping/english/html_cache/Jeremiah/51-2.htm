Historically, the "strangers" refer to the Medes and Persians, who conquered Babylon in 539 BC. This aligns with the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>, where God declares He will stir up the Medes against Babylon. The use of "strangers" emphasizes that these were not local or familiar forces but external powers raised by God for His purposes.<p><b>to winnow her and empty her land</b><br>The imagery of winnowing involves separating wheat from chaff, symbolizing judgment and purification. In an agricultural context, winnowing was a process of tossing grain into the air so the wind could blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the heavier grain. Here, it signifies the thoroughness of Babylon's destruction and the removal of its people and resources. This metaphor is also used in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>, to describe divine judgment.<p><b>for they will come against her from every side</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the attack on Babylon. Historically, the city was besieged by a coalition of forces, including the Medes and Persians, who surrounded it. The strategic encirclement ensured that Babylon had no escape, fulfilling the prophecy of its downfall. This mirrors the siege tactics described in other biblical accounts, such as the fall of Jerusalem in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25:1-4</a>.<p><b>in her day of disaster</b><br>The "day of disaster" refers to the appointed time of Babylon's judgment, a theme consistent throughout prophetic literature. This concept of a "day" of reckoning is seen in other prophecies, such as the "day of the Lord" in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2:1-2</a>, which signifies a time of divine intervention and judgment. For Babylon, this day was marked by the sudden and decisive conquest by the Medo-Persian Empire, as recorded in <a href="/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30-31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>An ancient city and empire known for its wealth, power, and opposition to God&#8217;s people.

On the whole it would seem best to accept the meaning of "strangers," the prophet connecting it with the verb for "fan," which contains the same consonants, for the sake of a rhythmical assonance. The imagery in either case is that of the familiar picture of the "threshing-floor," where the "strong wind" scatters the chaff in all directions (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>). The word for "empty" is the same as that used with an emphatic significance in <a href="/jeremiah/19-7.htm" title="And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 19:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Farmers</span>.
