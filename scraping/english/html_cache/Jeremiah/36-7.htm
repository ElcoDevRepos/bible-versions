In the context of <a href="/jeremiah/36.htm">Jeremiah 36</a>, the prophet Jeremiah is instructed to write down all the words spoken to him by the LORD, with the hope that the people of Judah might hear of the impending disaster and turn back to God. The act of bringing a petition before the LORD implies a formal request for mercy or intervention, akin to the prayers and supplications seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear from heaven and heal the land if His people humble themselves and pray.<p><b>and each one will turn from his wicked way</b><br>This phrase emphasizes individual responsibility in repentance. The call to turn from wickedness is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, highlighting the need for personal transformation and moral realignment with God's laws. The concept of turning, or repentance, is central to the message of the prophets, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30-32</a>, where God calls for repentance so that iniquity will not be a stumbling block. This turning is not just a physical act but a heartfelt change, aligning with the New Testament call to repentance in passages like <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>.<p><b>for great are the anger and fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the severity of God's judgment due to the persistent disobedience and idolatry of the people of Judah. The anger and fury of the LORD are expressions of His righteous indignation against sin, as seen in the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The historical context of Jeremiah's ministry includes the Babylonian threat, which serves as the instrument of God's judgment. This pronouncement of judgment is consistent with the prophetic warnings throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-13</a>, and foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption themes found in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe who wrote down the words of the prophet as dictated by him and read them to the people and officials.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was facing imminent judgment from God due to its persistent idolatry and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful, calling His people to repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The audience of Jeremiah's message, who were living in sin and needed to turn back to God to avoid His wrath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_repentance.htm">The Power of Repentance</a></b><br>God&#8217;s call to repentance is a recurring theme throughout Scripture.
