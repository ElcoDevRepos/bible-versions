In ancient times, agriculture was the backbone of any civilization, and cutting off the sower signifies a divine judgment leading to famine and desolation. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s judgment on nations that oppose His will, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>, where Babylon's downfall is prophesied. The imagery of cutting off the sower also reflects the cessation of life and productivity, a common motif in prophetic literature.<p><b>and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time</b><br>The sickle is a tool used for reaping, and its mention here underscores the complete disruption of the harvest, a critical time for any agrarian society. This disruption is a direct consequence of divine judgment. The harvest is often used metaphorically in Scripture to represent judgment or the gathering of people, as seen in <a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>, where the harvest symbolizes the end of the age. The cessation of the harvest in Babylon signifies the end of its abundance and the beginning of its downfall.<p><b>In the face of the oppressor&#8217;s sword</b><br>The oppressor's sword represents the invading forces that God uses as instruments of His judgment. Historically, this refers to the Medo-Persian conquest of Babylon, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/daniel/5.htm">Daniel 5</a>. The sword is a common biblical symbol for war and divine retribution, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-11</a>. The oppressor's sword indicates the inevitability of Babylon's defeat and the execution of divine justice.<p><b>each will turn to his own people</b><br>This phrase suggests a scattering of the Babylonian population and foreign residents returning to their homelands. It reflects the disintegration of Babylon's power and influence, as people seek safety and identity among their own kin. This dispersion is reminiscent of the scattering at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8-9</a>), where God confounded human pride and ambition. It also parallels the return of the Israelites from Babylonian exile, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>.<p><b>each will flee to his own land</b><br>The flight to one's own land signifies the collapse of Babylon's empire, as people abandon the city in fear and desperation. This mirrors the exodus motif found throughout Scripture, where God delivers His people from oppression, as seen in the Israelites' escape from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31-42</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of divine sovereignty, where God orchestrates the rise and fall of nations according to His purposes, as affirmed in <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant empire in biblical history, known for its conquest of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem.

There may, possibly, be a special reference to the fields within the walls of the city, upon which the population largely depended, and which were now to be devastated. (Diod. Sic. ii. 9; Pliny, <span class= "ital">Hist. Nat. </span>xi. 111.)<p><span class= "bld">For fear of the oppressing sword.</span>--The versions present the same noticeable variations, as in <a href="/jeremiah/46-16.htm" title="He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.">Jeremiah 46:16</a>, the LXX. giving "from the Greek sword," possibly with reference to the belief that Cyrus had subdued the 'olians and Ionians before the conquest of Babylon, and that they were fighting in his army, or to Alexander's capture of the city, and the Vulg. "from the sword of the dove," the latter rendering being supposed to refer to the dove on the Babylonian standard, as the emblem of Semiramis. Here, however, as Babylon is the object of attack, the latter allusion is scarcely applicable, and there is no sufficient reason for altering the English version. (See Note on <a href="/jeremiah/25-38.htm" title="He has forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.">Jeremiah 25:38</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-16.htm" title="He made many to fall, yes, one fell on another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.">Jeremiah 46:16</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">They shall flee every one to his own land.</span>--The words are significant as showing that the Jews were not the only people for whom the fall of Babylon was the signal of a return from exile. The policy of Nebuchadnezzar, like that of Assyria, had been to people his own territory with the captive populations of other countries, and Israel (as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-8.htm" title="Remove out of the middle of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.">Jeremiah 50:8</a>) was to lead the way in the return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut off the sower,</span> etc. "Babylon" here probably means Babylonia, for it is clear from ver. 12 that the curse belongs to the country as well as the city of Babylon; indeed, "Babylon" in ver. 13 seems to be used in the wider sense.
