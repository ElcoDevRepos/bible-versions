"The LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme command over heavenly armies, indicating His power and sovereignty. "The God of Israel" reaffirms His covenant relationship with Israel, reminding them of their unique position and responsibilities. This introduction is typical of prophetic declarations, underscoring that the message is not from Jeremiah himself but from God, demanding attention and obedience.<p><b>&#8216;Drink, get drunk, and vomit.</b><br>This imagery of drinking and drunkenness is symbolic of judgment and wrath. In the ancient Near East, drinking from a cup often represented experiencing a fate or destiny, particularly one of divine judgment. The progression from drinking to vomiting illustrates the overwhelming and inescapable nature of God's judgment. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, to depict the severity of divine retribution.<p><b>Fall down and never get up again,</b><br>This phrase signifies total defeat and destruction. The imagery of falling and not rising again conveys the finality of God's judgment. It reflects the irreversible consequences of persistent disobedience and rebellion against God. This is consistent with the warnings given throughout the prophetic books, where nations and individuals who oppose God's will face ultimate ruin.<p><b>because of the sword I will send among you.&#8217;</b><br>The "sword" represents war and destruction, a common tool of divine judgment in the Old Testament. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian invasion and the subsequent exile of Judah, fulfilling the warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets. The sword as an instrument of God's judgment is a recurring theme, seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>.

The prophet&#8217;s duty is to relay, not reinvent, the message (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). Our own task mirrors this: pass on God&#8217;s Word exactly as given, trusting its sufficiency and authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says</b><p>The title &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; highlights His command over every army&#8212;earthly and heavenly&#8212;while &#8220;God of Israel&#8221; affirms His covenant faithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-16.htm">Jeremiah 10:16</a>). The coming warning is therefore both universal and personal: the Sovereign of all nations speaks, yet He remains Israel&#8217;s God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drink</b><p>The cup image ties directly to <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>, where the nations must &#8220;drink the wine of My wrath.&#8221; To drink is to accept the judgment God assigns (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>).
