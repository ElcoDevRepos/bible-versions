"The Portion of Jacob" refers to God as the inheritance and possession of the people of Israel, emphasizing a personal and covenantal relationship. Unlike the lifeless idols made by human hands, God is living and active. This distinction is rooted in the covenant God made with Jacob, also known as Israel, highlighting the unique relationship between God and His chosen people. The term "portion" suggests a deep, sustaining relationship, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>, where God is described as the strength and portion forever.<p><b>for He is the Maker of all things</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and creative power, setting Him apart from idols, which are created by human hands. The assertion that God is the "Maker of all things" affirms His role as the Creator of the universe, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible, beginning with <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>. This creative authority establishes God's supremacy over all creation, including the idols that people worship. It also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus is identified as the agent of creation in <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a> and <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>.<p><b>and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance</b><br>Here, the focus is on Israel's special status as God's chosen people. The term "tribe of His inheritance" indicates that Israel holds a unique place in God's plan, being set apart for His purposes. This concept is rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The idea of inheritance also points to the future fulfillment of God's promises, including the coming of the Messiah from the line of Israel, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<p><b>the LORD of Hosts is His name</b><br>This title, "LORD of Hosts," emphasizes God's supreme authority and command over the heavenly armies. It is a frequent title in the Old Testament, illustrating God's power and ability to protect and deliver His people. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the covenantal name of God, revealing His eternal and unchanging nature. This title reassures Israel of God's omnipotence and faithfulness, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>, where David invokes the "LORD of Hosts" in his battle against Goliath. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God over all spiritual and earthly powers, a theme echoed in the New Testament, particularly in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch whose descendants became the twelve tribes of Israel.

Return for your servants' sake, the tribes of your inheritance.">Isaiah 63:17</a>--Heb.), but its exact meaning is not clear. The word may be "rod" in the sense of "sceptre," as in <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/micah/7-14.htm" title="Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.">Micah 7:14</a>. Israel is that over which, or by means of which, God rules. But the other meaning in which it stands for "stem," "division," "tribe" (as in <a href="/isaiah/19-13.htm" title="The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.">Isaiah 19:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/28-21.htm" title="And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.">Exodus 28:21</a>), is equally tenable. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The portion of Jacob</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Jehovah. The phrase appears to have been coined at a lower level of religion, when every nation was supposed to have its own patron deity; just as the prophet says, ironically, to the fetish-worshippers of Israel, "Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion" (<a href="/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>), and Moses, in Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), speaks of the host of heaven as having been "divided [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. assigned] unto all nations under the whole heaven." But, of course, the phrase is susceptible of a high, spiritual application (comp. <a href="/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>). God's people are, by their very conception, an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span>, chosen out by God, and choosing him, and not the world, for their portion.

How much more forcible is the original phrase: "... of the whole," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the universe!
