This practice was prevalent among the Israelites despite God's commandments against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The worship of the Queen of Heaven involved rituals that were directly opposed to the worship of Yahweh, highlighting the Israelites' syncretism and spiritual adultery. Historically, this idolatry was a significant issue during the reigns of certain kings, such as Manasseh, who led Judah into deep idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-5</a>).<p><b>and pouring out drink offerings to her,</b><br>Drink offerings were part of the sacrificial system in ancient Near Eastern religions, including the worship of Yahweh, but here they are misappropriated for idol worship. This act of pouring out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven signifies a complete devotion and allegiance to a false deity, which was a direct violation of the covenant relationship with God. The Israelites' actions reflect a misunderstanding of true worship, which should be directed solely to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-15</a>).<p><b>we have lacked everything</b><br>The people of Judah are expressing their belief that their misfortunes began when they ceased their idolatrous practices. This reflects a misunderstanding of the source of their blessings and curses. According to the covenant outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, blessings come from obedience to God, while curses result from disobedience. Their lack of everything is a consequence of their disobedience to God, not the cessation of idol worship.<p><b>and have been perishing by sword and famine.&#8221;</b><br>The sword and famine are common judgments from God for covenant unfaithfulness, as seen throughout the prophetic literature (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>). These calamities were prophesied as consequences for Israel's idolatry and rebellion against God. The people's interpretation of their suffering as a result of stopping idol worship shows their spiritual blindness and failure to recognize God's hand in their discipline.

God&#8217;s people had mingled pagan rituals with covenant life, a pattern condemned in <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>.<p>- The people&#8217;s complaint shows their hearts remained loyal to false worship despite exile and destruction (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pouring out drink offerings to her</b><p>- Drink offerings were ordained for the LORD alone (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). Redirecting them symbolized total spiritual infidelity (<a href="/isaiah/57-6.htm">Isaiah 57:6</a>).<p>- By linking incense with libations, the people highlight a comprehensive worship system handed over to an idol&#8212;echoing the syncretism in <a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a> where gifts from God were credited to Baal.<p>- Their admission underscores culpability; they cannot plead ignorance but knowingly transferred sacred acts to a forbidden deity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>we have lacked everything</b><p>- The community interprets economic loss as proof that abandoning the goddess displeased her. They misread providence, much like Israel complained of &#8220;no water&#8221; in <a href="/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a> while standing before the Rock that would provide.<p>- Scripture teaches the opposite cause-and-effect: obedience brings blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-6</a>); disobedience brings lack (<a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5-11</a>).<p>- Their statement exposes misplaced trust; instead of repenting toward the LORD who controls rain and harvest (<a href="/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>), they cling to a counterfeit source.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have been perishing by sword and famine.</b><p>- Sword and famine are covenant curses explicitly listed in <a href="/leviticus/26-25.htm">Leviticus 26:25-26</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>&#8212;disciplinary tools God uses when His people persist in sin.<p>- The very disasters they cite fulfill Jeremiah&#8217;s earlier prophecies (<a href="/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8, 42</a>:17). Far from proving the goddess&#8217;s power, these hardships confirm God&#8217;s Word is true and active.<p>- Their logic inverts reality: rather than see judgment as validation of Scripture, they interpret it as evidence against obeying God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The people claim that stopping their offerings to the Queen of Heaven triggered scarcity, sword, and famine. In truth, Scripture shows that these calamities resulted from the very idolatry they defend. <a href="/jeremiah/44-18.htm">Jeremiah 44:18</a> exposes a heart hardened by misplaced loyalty and spiritual blindness: they reinterpret God&#8217;s corrective discipline as a sign to return to false worship. The passage challenges believers to trust the LORD&#8217;s covenant promises and warnings, recognizing that life and provision flow from obedience to Him alone, not from any rival deity or self-made solution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">To burn incense to the queen of heaven.--</span>This form of worship, characterised specially by its offerings of crescent-shaped cakes, would seem to have been the dominant fashion of the idolatry of the time.
