The power of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting His ability to create and sustain the universe. <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> begins with God's creation of the heavens and the earth, underscoring His sovereign power. The Hebrew word for "made" suggests an intentional act of creation, not a random occurrence. This power is also evident in the miracles throughout the Bible, such as the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14) and the resurrection of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-6</a>).<p><b>He established the world by His wisdom</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to God's wisdom in creation. <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> echoes this sentiment, stating, "By wisdom the LORD laid the earth&#8217;s foundations." The world is not only a product of power but also of divine wisdom, indicating a purposeful and ordered creation. This wisdom is seen in the intricate design of nature and the laws that govern it. The wisdom of God is also personified in Christ, who is described as the "wisdom of God" in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>, linking creation to redemption.<p><b>and stretched out the heavens by His understanding.</b><br>The imagery of "stretching out the heavens" suggests the vastness and expanse of the universe, a concept that aligns with modern understandings of the cosmos. <a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> also uses this imagery, portraying God as sovereign over the heavens. The term "understanding" implies a deep knowledge and insight, further emphasizing the intentionality behind creation. This understanding is reflected in the order and complexity of the universe. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the agent of creation (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), embodying the divine understanding that brought forth the heavens.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment and restoration of Israel and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a> is a prophecy against Babylon, a powerful empire known for its conquest of Judah and the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The verse references the act of creation, highlighting God's power, wisdom, and understanding in forming the earth and the heavens.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, having made the earth by His power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_understanding.htm">Wisdom and Understanding</a></b><br>Reflect on the wisdom and understanding of God, which are evident in the order and complexity of the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_power.htm">Trust in God's Power</a></b><br>In times of uncertainty, trust in the same power that created the universe to sustain and guide you.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/creation_as_a_reflection_of_god.htm">Creation as a Reflection of God</a></b><br>See the natural world as a testament to God's character and attributes, leading to worship and reverence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_control_over_nations.htm">God's Control Over Nations</a></b><br>Understand that just as God created the world, He also governs the rise and fall of nations, including Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_51_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 51:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_51_15_God_s_creative_power.htm">How does Jeremiah 51:15 affirm God's power in creation and sovereignty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_God_s_power_reveal_about_Him.htm">What does "made the earth by His power" reveal about God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jer_51_15_boost_our_faith.htm">How can understanding God's creation power in Jeremiah 51:15 strengthen our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jer_51_15_Gen_1_1_on_God_as_Creator.htm">Connect Jeremiah 51:15 with Genesis 1:1 on God's role as Creator.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Use_God_s_creativity_daily.htm">How can we apply God's creative power in Jeremiah 51:15 to daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_51_15_God_s_creation_power.htm">How does Jeremiah 51:15 affirm God's sovereignty over creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_s_the_history_behind_Jeremiah_51_15.htm">What historical context surrounds Jeremiah 51:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_51_15_and_divine_judgment.htm">How does Jeremiah 51:15 relate to the theme of divine judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_51.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 51?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_heal_on_the_sabbath.htm">Is there work in Heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_qualifies_as_my_neighbor.htm">Is your will being done on earth as in heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_leads_the_army_of_the_lord.htm">Who leads the Army of the Lord?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_is_babylon's_fall_reconciled.htm">Jeremiah 51:8 says Babylon has &#8220;suddenly fallen,&#8221; yet historical records indicate a gradual decline&#8212;how is this reconciled? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Jeremiah 51:15 Mean</div><b>The LORD made the earth by His power</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah reminds the exiles that creation itself testifies to God&#8217;s unrivaled strength.

The God who spoke continents into existence can certainly topple an empire.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a> adds the same thought: &#8220;The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.&#8221; The message is clear&#8212;if God&#8217;s power shaped the planet, no human power can stand against Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He established the world by His wisdom</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Established&#8221; conveys permanence and order. <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> says, &#8220;By wisdom the LORD laid the earth&#8217;s foundations.&#8221; Creation isn&#8217;t a cosmic accident; it is a carefully arranged home for humanity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a> celebrates the same truth: &#8220;How many are Your works, O LORD! In wisdom You made them all.&#8221; Every ecosystem, every physical law, displays thoughtful design.<p>&#8226; For the people of Judah, this meant that their covenant God not only had power but also a wise plan&#8212;even when exile felt chaotic. <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16&#8211;17</a> later affirms that in Christ &#8220;all things hold together,&#8221; grounding our confidence in His unchanging wisdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stretched out the heavens by His understanding</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;stretched out&#8221; paints a vivid picture of God unrolling the sky like a tent (<a href="/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>). Ancient observers saw the vast expanse above and marveled; Jeremiah points to God&#8217;s &#8220;understanding&#8221; as the architect behind that grandeur.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a> echoes this: &#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God.&#8221; Their ordered movements&#8212;day after day, season after season&#8212;preach God&#8217;s intelligence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/51-13.htm">Isaiah 51:13</a> comforts Israel with the same imagery: the God who &#8220;stretched out the heavens&#8221; is the one who shields His people. If He controls the cosmos, He can certainly control their future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Jeremiah 51:15</a> piles up three truths about the Lord&#8212;His power, His wisdom, His understanding&#8212;to prove that He alone is the sovereign Creator. In a chapter announcing Babylon&#8217;s fall, the verse reassures God&#8217;s people that the Maker of earth, world, and heavens is fully able to overthrow idols, judge nations, and keep every promise. Trust rests secure when it rests in the One who designed, sustains, and commands all creation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/51.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15-19) <span class= "bld">He hath made the earth by his power . . .</span>--The five verses are a reproduction of <a href="/context/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a>, fitted in here to enhance the majesty of Him Who decrees the destruction of Babylon, and appoints Israel to be the instrument of that destruction. The word "Israel," as the italics show, is wanting in the Hebrew, and we have a sufficient sense without it. "He is the former of all things, and <span class= "ital">of the rod </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the tribe) of his inheritance." The English version follows the Vulgate and the Targum in treating the omission as an error of transcription. (See Notes on <a href="/context/jeremiah/10-12.htm" title="He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and has stretched out the heavens by his discretion.">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/51.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-19.</span> - Probably interpolated from <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12-16</a> (the only verbal difference is in ver. 19, where "Israel" is left out before "the rod of his inheritance"). But may not Jeremiah have quoted himself? Conceivably, yes; but he would surely not have quoted such a passage here, where it spoils the context. For granting that a point of contact with ver. 14 may be found for vers. 15, 16 (Jehovah who has sworn has also the power to accomplish), yet the passage on the idols stands quite by itself, and distracts the attention of the reader. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/51-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#347;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1433;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by His power;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1495;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
