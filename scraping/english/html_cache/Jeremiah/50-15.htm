In the biblical context, Babylon represents a powerful empire that oppressed Israel and other nations. The call to surround and attack from every side signifies a complete and inescapable judgment. Historically, Babylon was a formidable city with strong defenses, making this call to surround it significant. This mirrors the siege warfare common in ancient times, where cities were encircled to cut off supplies and force surrender.<p><b>She has thrown up her hands in surrender;</b><br>The imagery of surrender highlights Babylon's defeat and helplessness. In ancient warfare, raising hands was a universal sign of giving up. This phrase suggests that despite Babylon's might, it will ultimately succumb to divine judgment. Theologically, it reflects the humbling of human pride before God's sovereignty. This surrender can be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets about Babylon's downfall.<p><b>her towers have fallen;</b><br>Towers were symbols of strength and defense in ancient cities. The fall of Babylon's towers signifies the collapse of its military power and defenses. Archaeologically, Babylon was known for its impressive structures, including the famous Ishtar Gate and its defensive walls. The fall of these towers represents the broader theme of God's judgment against human arrogance and self-reliance.<p><b>her walls are torn down.</b><br>Walls were crucial for a city's protection, and their destruction indicates total defeat. Babylon's walls were legendary for their thickness and height, making this statement a powerful image of divine retribution. This destruction fulfills prophecies about Babylon's fall and serves as a reminder of the futility of trusting in human fortifications over divine protection.<p><b>Since this is the vengeance of the LORD,</b><br>This phrase underscores that the judgment against Babylon is not merely a political or military event but a divine act of retribution. The concept of divine vengeance is rooted in the justice of God, who repays nations and individuals according to their deeds. This reflects the biblical principle that God is the ultimate judge who rights wrongs and punishes sin.<p><b>take out your vengeance upon her;</b><br>The call for vengeance is a directive for the agents of God's judgment to execute His justice. This reflects the biblical theme of retributive justice, where wrongs are avenged in accordance with divine will. It also serves as a warning to other nations about the consequences of defying God and oppressing His people.<p><b>as she has done, do the same to her.</b><br>This phrase highlights the principle of measure-for-measure justice, where Babylon receives the same treatment it meted out to others. It echoes the biblical law of retribution found in passages like <a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, "eye for eye, tooth for tooth." This principle is seen throughout scripture as a reflection of God's just nature, ensuring that actions have corresponding consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The city and empire that is the subject of God's judgment in this passage.

The verse assures believers that the Lord literally governs history, humbling every power that opposes His righteousness and vindicating those wronged by human tyranny.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">She hath given her hand.</span>--The words paint the attitude of one who submits and stretches forth his hand, as a sign that he gives himself into the power of the conqueror. (Comp. <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm" title="And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.">Ezra 10:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm" title="Now be you not stiff necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.">2Chronicles 30:8</a>; <a href="/lamentations/5-6.htm" title="We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.">Lamentations 5:6</a>.) So in Latin "<span class= "ital">dare manum</span>" was a synonym for submission (Cic. <span class= "ital">de Amic. </span>26).<p><span class= "bld">Her foundations are fallen.</span>--Better, with the LXX., <span class= "ital">bastions </span>or <span class= "ital">bulwarks.</span><p><span class= "bld">As she hath done, do unto her.</span>--We note an identity of thought and almost of language with <a href="/psalms/137-8.htm" title="O daughter of Babylon, who are to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards you as you have served us.">Psalm 137:8</a>. Had the Psalmist heard the prophecy, or the prophet the psalm? The former seems the more probable alternative.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shout against her</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> raise the battle cry (comp. <a href="/joshua/6-16.htm">Joshua 6:16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-13.htm">Isaiah 42:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">She hath given her hand.</span> This action is generally mentioned as a pledge of friendship or a ratification of a promise (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-19.htm">Ezra 10:19</a>); but the notion of surrender or submission would naturally follow (so in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-24.htm">1 Chronicles 29:24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-8.htm">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>).
