The fourth month corresponds to Tammuz in the Hebrew calendar, roughly June-July. The ninth day marks a significant point in the siege, highlighting the prolonged suffering of the city. This timing is crucial as it fulfills the prophecy of Jeremiah regarding the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2-3</a>).<p><b>the famine in the city was so severe</b><br>The severity of the famine underscores the dire conditions within Jerusalem due to the Babylonian siege. This was a common tactic in ancient warfare, where besieging armies would cut off supplies to force a city into submission. The famine fulfills the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16-17</a>), who foretold the consequences of Judah's disobedience to God. The famine also serves as a physical manifestation of spiritual desolation due to the people's rebellion against God.<p><b>that the people of the land had no food</b><br>This phrase highlights the desperation and suffering of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. The "people of the land" refers to the common citizens, emphasizing that the famine affected everyone, not just the ruling class. This situation is reminiscent of other biblical famines, such as those in the time of Joseph (Genesis 41) and during the siege of Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-29</a>). The lack of food symbolizes the judgment of God upon the nation for its idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. It also foreshadows the ultimate spiritual hunger that can only be satisfied by Christ, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.
