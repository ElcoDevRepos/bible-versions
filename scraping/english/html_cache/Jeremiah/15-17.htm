In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sitting with revelers would imply participation in activities contrary to God's commands. This separation highlights Jeremiah's commitment to his prophetic calling, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which advises against walking in the counsel of the wicked. The prophet's lifestyle serves as a model of holiness and dedication to God's mission.<p><b>nor did I celebrate with them</b><br>Jeremiah's refusal to join in celebrations with the revelers underscores his role as a prophet set apart for God's purposes. Celebrations in ancient times often included pagan rituals and idolatry, which Jeremiah was called to denounce. His abstention reflects a life of sacrifice and obedience, aligning with the Nazarite vow of separation for God's service, as seen in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>.<p><b>Because Your hand was on me</b><br>The phrase indicates divine calling and empowerment. God's hand on Jeremiah signifies both guidance and the burden of his prophetic mission. This echoes the experiences of other prophets, such as Ezekiel, who felt the hand of the Lord upon him (<a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament concept of being led by the Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>.<p><b>I sat alone</b><br>Jeremiah's solitude is a result of his prophetic office, which often required him to stand against the prevailing culture. This isolation is a common theme among prophets, who frequently faced rejection and loneliness. Elijah's experience in <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>, where he felt alone in his zeal for God, parallels Jeremiah's situation. The solitude underscores the cost of discipleship and the call to be set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>for You have filled me with indignation</b><br>The indignation Jeremiah feels is a righteous anger against the sin and idolatry of his people. This divine indignation is a reflection of God's own anger towards sin, as seen throughout the prophetic books. It aligns with Jesus' cleansing of the temple in <a href="/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15-17</a>, where His zeal for God's house consumed Him. Jeremiah's indignation is not personal but a response to the spiritual state of the nation, emphasizing the prophet's alignment with God's heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

He literally refused to join those whose gatherings were marked by mocking, idolatry, or drunken excess.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, &#8220;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4-5</a> shows the same resolve: &#8220;I do not sit with deceitful men&#8230; I hate the assembly of evildoers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Such separation safeguarded Jeremiah&#8217;s testimony and protected him from the corrupting influence warned about in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>.<p>God calls His people to holiness, and Jeremiah obeyed by steering clear of revelry that dishonored the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor did I celebrate with them</b><p>He adds that he did not even participate in their festivals or good-time gatherings. In Judah many civil and religious feasts had become empty rituals mixed with pagan practice (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusing to &#8220;celebrate with them&#8221; meant rejecting surface-level joy that ignored sin and judgment (<a href="/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a> reinforces this posture: &#8220;Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.&#8221;<p>Jeremiah&#8217;s abstinence underscores that true joy springs from obedience, not from the crowd&#8217;s entertainment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because Your hand was on me</b><p>The reason for Jeremiah&#8217;s separation is not elitism but divine calling. &#8220;Your hand&#8221; speaks of God&#8217;s compelling power and authority on his life (<a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God had formed and consecrated him before birth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; When the Lord lays hold of a servant, that servant&#8217;s first allegiance shifts permanently to Him (<a href="/acts/4-19.htm">Acts 4:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s choices, therefore, flowed from submission to God&#8217;s grip, not personal preference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I sat alone</b><p>Obedience often leads to loneliness. Jeremiah literally sat in solitary places, cut off from friends who chose compromise.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/3-28.htm">Lamentations 3:28</a> advises, &#8220;Let him sit alone in silence, for God has laid it on him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself modeled purposeful solitude to stay aligned with the Father&#8217;s will (<a href="/matthew/14-23.htm">Matthew 14:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The loneliness reinforced dependence on God, proving that fellowship with Him outweighs popularity with people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For You have filled me with indignation</b><p>The final clause reveals Jeremiah&#8217;s inward condition. God filled him with righteous anger against Judah&#8217;s sin, so revelry held zero appeal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>: &#8220;Zeal for Your house has consumed me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a> shows the same holy indignation in Jesus as He grieved over hardened hearts.<p>&#8226; This is not human bitterness but a Spirit-given burden that drives bold proclamation of truth (<a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>).<p>Jeremiah&#8217;s indignation mirrored God&#8217;s own, compelling him to speak even when it cost him companionship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a> paints a vivid picture of a man set apart. He declined sinful company and empty celebration because the Lord&#8217;s powerful hand rested on him. That call led to lonely moments, yet it also filled him with God&#8217;s righteous indignation, equipping him to confront a wayward nation. The verse reminds believers today that faithful obedience may isolate us from worldly amusements, but the presence and purpose of God more than compensate for any loss of human approval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">In the assembly of the mockers.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">of the mirthful. </span>The word, which is the same as that found in Isaac (= laughter), does not necessarily imply an evil or cynical mirth, like that of the "scorner" of <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm" title="Blessed is the man that walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful.">Psalm 1:1</a>. What is meant is, that from the time of his consecration to his office the prophet's life had not been as the life of other men, but had been marked by a strange loneliness, filled with the consuming wrath of Jehovah against the evils that surrounded him. The "hand" of Jehovah is used here, as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm" title="The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm" title="And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, for the special overpowering consciousness of the fulness of inspiration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of the mockers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the laughers</span>. The serious thoughts arising out of his sacred office restrained him from taking part in the festive meetings to which his youth would naturally incline him (comp. on Jeremiah 16:2). <span class="cmt_word">Because of thy hand</span>. The Hand of Jehovah is a figurative expression for the self-revealing and irresistible power of Jehovah; it is, therefore, equivalent to the Arm of Jehovah (<a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), but is used in preference with regard to the divinely ordained actions and words of the prophets. Thus we are told, in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, that "the hand of the Lord came upon" them (<a href="/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). Such a phrase was probably at first descriptive of a completely passive ecstatic state, and was retained when ecstasies had become rare, with a somewhat laxer meaning. Isaiah uses a similar expression but once (<a href="/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>); Ezekiel, however, who appears to have been unusually rifled with the overpowering thought of the supernatural world, is constantly mentioning "the hand of Jehovah" (see <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; and especially Ezekiel 3:14; 8:3). We may infer from this variation in the practice of inspired writers that, though symbolical, anthropomorphic language is not always equally necessary in speaking of Divine things, yet it cannot be entirely dispensed with, even by the most gifted and spiritual teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast filled me with indignation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hadst filled me</span>. Jeremiah was too full of his Divine message to indulge in impracticable sentimentalities. There was no thought of self when Jeremiah received his mission, nor any bitterness towards those who up-posed him. His "indignation" was that of Jehovah, whose simple instrument he was (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, "I am full of the fury of the Lord"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I never</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1445;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;a&#7687;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the band</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1505;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;s&#333;&#183;w&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
