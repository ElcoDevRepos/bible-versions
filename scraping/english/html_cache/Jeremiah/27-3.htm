Edom, Moab, and Ammon were neighboring nations east of the Jordan River, often in conflict with Israel. Tyre and Sidon were prominent Phoenician cities to the north, known for their trade and wealth. The inclusion of these nations highlights the widespread impact of Babylonian dominance. Historically, these regions had complex relationships with Israel, sometimes allies, other times adversaries. The message signifies God's sovereignty over all nations, not just Israel, and foreshadows the coming judgment through Babylon.<p><b>through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem</b><br>Envoys or messengers from these nations were present in Jerusalem, likely to discuss political alliances or strategies against the rising Babylonian threat. This setting underscores the political tension of the time, as smaller nations sought to resist Babylon's expansion. The presence of these envoys in Jerusalem suggests a temporary unity among these nations, possibly considering rebellion against Babylon. The use of envoys also reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of diplomacy and alliance-building.<p><b>to Zedekiah king of Judah</b><br>Zedekiah was the last king of Judah, placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. His reign was marked by political instability and pressure from both Babylon and internal factions. Zedekiah's position was precarious, as he was caught between loyalty to Babylon and the desire for independence. This message to Zedekiah emphasizes his role as a key figure in the unfolding events and highlights the prophetic warning given to him. The historical context of Zedekiah's reign, leading to the eventual fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, is crucial for understanding the gravity of Jeremiah's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom,_moab,_ammon,_tyre,_and_sidon.htm">Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon</a></b><br>Neighboring nations of Judah, each with its own history of interactions with Israel and Judah, often characterized by conflict and alliances.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/envoys.htm">Envoys</a></b><br>Representatives or messengers from these nations who have come to Jerusalem, likely to discuss political alliances or responses to the Babylonian threat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the time of the Babylonian conquest and was known for his vacillation between allegiance to Babylon and rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, a central location for political and religious activity, and the focal point of God's messages through Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br><a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a> reminds us that God is sovereign over all nations, not just Israel.

The verse underlines God&#8217;s absolute authority over every nation, the futility of rebellion, and the call to humble submission to His appointed yoke. Political schemes, bloodlines, wealth, or influence cannot cancel God&#8217;s Word; only obedience brings life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And send them to the king of Edom.</span>--The princes that are named had, as the context shows, sent their ambassadors to Zedekiah, proposing an alliance against Nebuchadnezzar. They are named in the same order as in the prophecy of <a href="/context/jeremiah/25-21.htm" title="Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,">Jeremiah 25:21-22</a>, which had been delivered fifteen years before. The prophecy then delivered had been in part fulfilled, but these princes were still struggling against it, encouraged, apparently, by the difficulties which in Media and elsewhere seemed to delay the complete triumph of the Chaldaean king; and the prophet is commissioned to tell all of them alike that their efforts are in vain, and that the supremacy of Babylon was, for the time, part of God's order, for the chastisement of the nations. In Jeremiah 49 we have a fuller, and probably later, development of the same strain of prediction.<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And send them</span>, etc. The letter of the text certainly suggests that Jeremiah actually delivered a separate yoke to each of the five ambassadors. Some commentators, however, finding such an act almost incredible, suppose the statement to be allegorical, and the "sending of the yoke" to mean the declaration of the subjection of the nations to Nebuchadnezzar which follows, somewhat as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> the "causing all the nations to drink "means the utterance of a prophecy of woe to the various peoples concerned. But we can hardly pronounce upon this passage by itself. We have to consider whether a whole group of similar statements is or is not to be taken literally. It may be enough to instance <a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which are come</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Send</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;il&#183;la&#7717;&#183;t&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
