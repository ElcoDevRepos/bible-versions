Jeremiah, as a prophet, received divine revelations which he then communicated to his scribe, Baruch. This method underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, as it was directly from the prophet's mouth. The use of dictation highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, similar to how Moses received the Law from God and conveyed it to the Israelites.<p><b>Baruch replied.</b><br>Baruch, the son of Neriah, was a faithful scribe and companion to Jeremiah. His role was crucial in preserving the prophetic messages. Baruch's presence in the narrative emphasizes the importance of scribes in the transmission of biblical texts. Historically, scribes were educated individuals responsible for writing and maintaining records, which was a respected and essential role in ancient societies. Baruch's loyalty and dedication to Jeremiah's mission reflect the commitment required to uphold God's word.<p><b>He recited all these words to me</b><br>This phrase indicates the oral tradition of passing down messages before they were written. Jeremiah's recitation to Baruch signifies the careful preservation of God's word. The oral transmission of divine messages is a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke to His disciples and the crowds. The emphasis on "all these words" suggests the completeness and precision required in conveying God's messages, ensuring nothing was omitted or altered.<p><b>and I wrote them in ink</b><br>The use of ink signifies the permanence and seriousness of the message. In ancient times, writing materials were precious, and the use of ink on a scroll indicates the intention for the message to be preserved and disseminated. This act of writing down the words aligns with the biblical theme of recording God's laws and prophecies, as seen in the tablets of the Law given to Moses. The written word serves as a lasting testament to God's communication with His people.<p><b>on the scroll.</b><br>Scrolls were the primary medium for written documents in the ancient Near East. The use of a scroll for Jeremiah's prophecies indicates the importance of the message and its intended public reading. Scrolls were often used for official and religious texts, highlighting the sacred nature of the content. This method of documentation connects to other scriptural instances, such as the scrolls of the Law and the scrolls mentioned in Revelation, symbolizing the continuity and fulfillment of God's word throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>The scribe and faithful companion of Jeremiah, who transcribed the words of the prophet as dictated by him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his resistance to Jeremiah's prophecies and his eventual destruction of the scroll.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>A physical representation of God's word, written by Baruch at Jeremiah's dictation, intended to be read to the people and the king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem where the scroll was read to the people, symbolizing the presence of God among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithful_transmission.htm">The Importance of Faithful Transmission</a></b><br>Baruch's role as a scribe highlights the importance of accurately preserving and transmitting God's word.

This echoes <a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>, where the Lord says, &#8220;Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows the prophet as a conduit, not an editor (<a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>; 30:2; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). God&#8217;s message flows through Jeremiah&#8217;s mouth to Baruch&#8217;s pen without alteration, underscoring verbal inspiration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Baruch replied</b><p>&#8226; Baruch functions as a faithful scribe (<a href="/jeremiah/32-12.htm">Jeremiah 32:12</a>; 45:1). His response under oath before the officials (<a href="/jeremiah/36-17.htm">Jeremiah 36:17</a>) affirms the chain of custody for the scroll, assuring the leaders&#8212;and us&#8212;that nothing was fabricated.<p>&#8226; His integrity models how believers today ought to steward God&#8217;s Word (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He recited all these words to me</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s complete oral delivery means Baruch received the full message, not selective highlights (<a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2, 32</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear when Samuel relays the Lord&#8217;s word to Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17&#8211;18</a>) and when John is told, &#8220;Write in a book what you see&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>). The pattern: revelation spoken, faithfully repeated, then recorded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I wrote them in ink</b><p>&#8226; Writing &#8220;in ink&#8221; stresses permanence. Unlike clay tablets that could be wiped, ink on parchment signified lasting testimony (cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>, &#8220;write it on a tablet&#8230; inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The written form guards the message against distortion (<a href="/galatians/6-11.htm">Galatians 6:11</a> shows Paul likewise emphasizing his own handwriting for authenticity).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the scroll</b><p>&#8226; A single scroll gathers all prophecies from Josiah&#8217;s reign onward (<a href="/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>). Scroll imagery pervades Scripture&#8212;Ezekiel&#8217;s scroll of lament (<a href="/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9&#8211;10</a>) and the sealed scroll in heaven (<a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>). Each signifies God&#8217;s authoritative record that invites either obedience or judgment.<p>&#8226; When King Jehoiakim later cuts and burns this very scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>), he attacks the physical medium but cannot erase the divine message; God simply commands a new, expanded scroll (<a href="/jeremiah/36-32.htm">Jeremiah 36:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-18.htm">Jeremiah 36:18</a> showcases a seamless chain of revelation: God speaks to Jeremiah; Jeremiah dictates every word; Baruch records them permanently on a scroll.
