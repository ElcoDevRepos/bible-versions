The triad of "sword, famine, and plague" is a common biblical motif representing comprehensive judgment (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>). Historically, these were real threats faced by nations during times of war and siege, particularly in the ancient Near East. The mention of these calamities underscores the severity of the situation and the urgency of heeding God's warning.<p><b>as the LORD has decreed</b><br>This emphasizes the divine authority behind the message. The decree of the LORD is irrevocable and highlights the sovereignty of God over nations. In the context of Jeremiah, God's decrees often come as a result of covenant violations by His people. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's justice and the fulfillment of His word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon</b><br>This part of the verse situates the prophecy within the historical context of the Babylonian Empire's dominance. Serving the king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, was presented as God's will for the nations at that time. This was a period when Babylon was the instrument of God's judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). Theologically, it reflects the theme of submission to God's appointed authority, even when it comes through foreign powers. This can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate authority over all nations, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

27:13 Mean</div><b>Why should you and your people die</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah poses a pointed question to Judah&#8217;s leaders, much like Moses&#8217; &#8220;I have set before you life and death&#8230; choose life&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already warned King Zedekiah in the previous verse: &#8220;Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The appeal is pastoral as well as prophetic&#8212;there is still a path to life if they will heed the warning. Compare <a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17-20</a>, where the prophet repeats this call to surrender and live.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by sword and famine and plague</b><p>&#8226; These three judgments form a familiar triad in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>; 21:7) and throughout Scripture (<a href="/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11-12</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Sword: literal military defeat at Babylon&#8217;s hands.<p>&#8226; Famine: siege conditions cutting off food (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Plague: disease that often follows war and hunger.<p>&#8226; The repetition underlines that no avenue of self-preservation remains if Judah resists. God&#8217;s Word here is not symbolic hyperbole but a concrete forecast of what will happen.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD has decreed</b><p>&#8226; The calamity is not Babylon&#8217;s idea; it is &#8220;the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel&#8221; who has spoken (<a href="/jeremiah/27-4.htm">Jeremiah 27:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s decrees stand firm (<a href="/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24</a>). He had long announced seventy years of Babylonian domination (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>; 29:10).<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17</a> confirms, &#8220;The LORD has done what He purposed; He has fulfilled His word.&#8221; Resisting this decree places Judah in direct conflict with God, not merely with a foreign empire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?</b><p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar is called &#8220;My servant&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>), God&#8217;s chosen instrument to discipline the nations.<p>&#8226; The scope is universal&#8212;&#8220;any nation.&#8221; Surrounding kingdoms received the same message (<a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Submission to Babylon, therefore, equals submission to God&#8217;s present plan; refusal equals rebellion against heaven (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37-38</a> later affirms that the Most High gives kingdoms to whom He wills, confirming Jeremiah&#8217;s prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/27-13.htm">Jeremiah 27:13</a> is a divine plea wrapped in a warning. God, who commands history, asks Judah why they would choose death&#8212;literal death through war, starvation, and disease&#8212;when life is still available through humble obedience. The sword, famine, and plague are real and inevitable for any nation that rejects His decree to submit to Babylon, His appointed servant for that season.
