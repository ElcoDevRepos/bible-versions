The wilderness often symbolizes a place of solitude and separation from society, as seen in the experiences of figures like Moses and Elijah. The "traveler's lodge" suggests a temporary refuge, indicating Jeremiah's yearning for a brief respite from the moral decay surrounding him. This longing for isolation echoes the prophet's role as an outsider, often rejected by his own people for delivering God's messages.<p><b>I would abandon my people and depart from them</b><br>Jeremiah expresses a profound sense of frustration and disillusionment with the Israelites. His desire to abandon them highlights the severity of their unfaithfulness and the burden of his prophetic mission. This sentiment is reminiscent of other prophets who felt overwhelmed by the people's persistent rebellion, such as Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>. The prophet's struggle underscores the tension between divine calling and human emotion.<p><b>for they are all adulterers</b><br>The term "adulterers" is used metaphorically to describe the Israelites' spiritual unfaithfulness to God. In the Old Testament, idolatry is often equated with adultery, as seen in Hosea's prophetic ministry. This imagery conveys the seriousness of Israel's covenant breach, portraying their worship of other gods as a betrayal akin to marital infidelity. The use of "all" emphasizes the widespread nature of this sin among the people.<p><b>a crowd of faithless people</b><br>The phrase "a crowd of faithless people" underscores the collective nature of Israel's apostasy. The term "faithless" suggests a lack of trust and loyalty to God, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature. This description aligns with the broader biblical narrative of Israel's repeated cycles of disobedience and repentance. The crowd imagery may also evoke the idea of a mob mentality, where individuals are swept up in the prevailing culture of unfaithfulness, further illustrating the pervasive spiritual decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing his deep sorrow and frustration over the sinful state of his people, Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is the focus of Jeremiah's lament due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Symbolically represents a place of isolation and separation, where Jeremiah wishes to escape from the corruption of his people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/adulterers.htm">Adulterers</a></b><br>Refers to the spiritual unfaithfulness of the people of Judah, who have turned away from God to worship idols.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/traitors.htm">Traitors</a></b><br>Indicates the betrayal of God's covenant by the people, highlighting their disloyalty and deceit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_pain_of_prophetic_ministry.htm">The Pain of Prophetic Ministry</a></b><br>Jeremiah's lament highlights the emotional burden of speaking God's truth to a rebellious people.

The verse invites us to examine our own loyalties, refuse to normalize idolatry, and stay close enough to the Lord that, if needed, we too would rather flee to the wilderness than join the crowd in unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Oh, that I had . . .!</span>--Literally, as before, <span class= "ital">Who will give<span class= "bld"> . . .</span></span>?<p><span class= "bld">A lodging place of wayfaring men.</span>--i.e., a place of shelter, a <span class= "ital">khan </span>or <span class= "ital">caravanserai, </span>such as were built for travellers, such, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>as the "inn" of <a href="/genesis/42-27.htm" title="And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.">Genesis 42:27</a>, the "habitation" of Chimham (<a href="/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a>), which the son of Barzillai had erected near Bethlehem, as an act of munificent gratitude to his adopted country (<a href="/2_samuel/19-40.htm" title="Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.">2Samuel 19:40</a>).
