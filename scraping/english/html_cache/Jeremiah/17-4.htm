The inheritance includes not only the physical land but also the spiritual blessings associated with being God's chosen people. The relinquishing of this inheritance is a consequence of the people's disobedience and idolatry, as seen throughout the book of Jeremiah. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-68</a>, where God outlines the consequences of turning away from Him.<p><b>I will enslave you to your enemies in a land that you do not know,</b><br>This prophecy was fulfilled during the Babylonian exile when the people of Judah were taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar and brought to Babylon, a foreign land (<a href="/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14-16</a>). The concept of being enslaved to enemies is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often serving as a punishment for Israel's unfaithfulness (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>). The phrase "a land that you do not know" emphasizes the unfamiliarity and alienation the Israelites would experience, contrasting with the familiarity and security of their own land.<p><b>for you have kindled My anger;</b><br>The anger of God is a response to the persistent sin and rebellion of His people. Throughout Jeremiah, the prophet highlights the idolatry, injustice, and covenant unfaithfulness that provoked God's wrath (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18-20</a>). This divine anger is not arbitrary but is rooted in the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>).<p><b>it will burn forever.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "it will burn forever" signifies the intensity and seriousness of God's judgment. While "forever" can denote an indefinite period rather than eternity, it underscores the enduring consequences of sin. However, in the broader biblical narrative, God's judgment is often followed by restoration and hope, as seen in the promises of a new covenant and return from exile (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>). This tension between judgment and mercy is ultimately resolved in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who bears God's wrath on behalf of humanity (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Thus we get for the opening of this verse, "And thou shalt let loose thy hand" (i.e. as Authorized Version, "shalt discontinue"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you yourself will relinquish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
