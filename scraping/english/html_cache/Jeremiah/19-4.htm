Abandoning God signifies a breach of the covenant relationship established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The term "foreign place" suggests that the land, once dedicated to Yahweh, has been defiled by idolatry, making it unrecognizable as a place of worship to the true God. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness seen throughout the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where the lack of knowledge of God leads to destruction.<p><b>They have burned incense in this place to other gods</b><br>Burning incense was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religious rituals, symbolizing prayers or offerings to deities. The act of burning incense to other gods indicates a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This idolatry was not only a religious betrayal but also a cultural assimilation into the practices of surrounding nations, which God had explicitly warned against (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30-31</a>). The reference to "this place" likely points to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, associated with idolatrous practices and later known as Gehenna, a symbol of judgment.<p><b>that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have ever known</b><br>This phrase underscores the novelty and severity of the idolatry being practiced. The gods being worshiped were foreign to the traditional worship of Yahweh, indicating a departure from the faith of their ancestors. This highlights the generational shift away from the covenantal faithfulness expected by God. The mention of "kings of Judah" suggests that even the leadership, which should have upheld the worship of Yahweh, was complicit in this apostasy. This is reminiscent of the reforms of King Josiah (2 Kings 23), who sought to eradicate such practices.<p><b>They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent</b><br>The shedding of innocent blood likely refers to child sacrifices, a heinous practice associated with the worship of Molech, which was explicitly condemned in <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21 and 20</a>:2-5. This act of violence and moral corruption was a grave sin in the eyes of God, leading to divine judgment. The phrase "blood of the innocent" also evokes the broader biblical theme of justice and the sanctity of life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> with Abel's blood crying out from the ground. This foreshadows the ultimate innocent blood shed by Jesus Christ, who, unlike these victims, willingly gave His life for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>Deities worshiped by the surrounding nations, which the people of Judah adopted, forsaking the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_judah.htm">Kings of Judah</a></b><br>The rulers who, at various times, led the nation either towards or away from God, with many succumbing to idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blood_of_the_innocent.htm">The blood of the innocent</a></b><br>Refers to the practice of child sacrifice and other forms of innocent bloodshed that were part of the idolatrous practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forsaking_god.htm">The Danger of Forsaking God</a></b><br>Turning away from God leads to spiritual and moral decay.

Throughout Scripture, abandonment of the Lord leads to judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>). In Jeremiah&#8217;s day, Judah&#8217;s leaders and people consciously chose self-reliance and idolatry over obedience, mirroring earlier warnings like <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, &#8220;My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water, and dug their own cisterns.&#8221; God&#8217;s first grievance, then, is relational: His people broke fellowship with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have made this a foreign place</b><p>By turning from the Lord, Judah transformed their own land&#8212;meant to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>)&#8212;into &#8220;a foreign place,&#8221; a spiritually alien territory. The valley of Ben-Hinnom, where this prophecy is spoken (<a href="/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2</a>), had become so defiled that God no longer recognized it as His. Similar language appears in <a href="/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>, where Israel&#8217;s conduct causes the land to reflect the nations rather than God&#8217;s kingdom. The people&#8217;s sin rebranded a sacred inheritance as strange ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have burned incense in this place to other gods</b><p>Incense was designed for the worship of Yahweh alone (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-9</a>), yet Judah redirected it to false deities. Incense signifies continuous prayer and devotion (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). When that symbol is hijacked, it tells heaven that allegiance has shifted. The very act that was to express intimacy with God now broadcasts betrayal, echoing God&#8217;s lament in <a href="/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12-13</a> that Judah has &#8220;as many altars to Shame as there are streets in Jerusalem.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Gods neither they nor their fathers nor Judah&#8217;s kings have ever known</b><p>The phrase underscores how radical their apostasy was. They were not merely reviving an old compromise; they introduced brand-new idols, severing ties with the faith heritage of Abraham, Moses, and David (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-7</a>). By choosing unknown gods, they rejected centuries of revealed truth. God&#8217;s righteous kings, such as Josiah, had reclaimed worship (<a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24-25</a>), yet the nation reverted, proving that past reforms cannot substitute for present obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent</b><p>Idolatry inevitably cheapens life. Jeremiah points to child sacrifice in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom (<a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37-38</a>). The shedding of innocent blood violates the heart of God, who declares life sacred from <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a> onward. In <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>, Jesus indicts the leaders of His day for the same pattern&#8212;bloodguilt piling up across generations. Spiritual infidelity always spills over into moral atrocity; abandoning truth breeds violence against the vulnerable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a> provides God&#8217;s indictment in five linked charges: Judah abandoned Him, desecrated their land, redirected worship to idols, sought gods without covenant history, and perpetrated murderous injustice. Each sin deepens the next, showing how forsaking the Lord corrupts worship, culture, and eventually human life itself.
