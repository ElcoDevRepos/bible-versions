In the ancient Near East, the reputation of a nation was crucial, and shame was a significant cultural concept. The defeat of Egypt, a powerful nation, would have been a shocking event, resonating with other nations who might have feared Egypt's military might. This echoes the biblical theme of God humbling the proud, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."<p><b>and your outcry fills the earth</b><br>The imagery of an outcry filling the earth emphasizes the magnitude of Egypt's distress and the impact of their defeat. This can be compared to the cries of other nations in the Bible who faced God's judgment, such as in <a href="/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>, where Moab's cries are heard. The outcry signifies not only physical defeat but also spiritual and emotional turmoil, reflecting the consequences of opposing God's will.<p><b>because warrior stumbles over warrior</b><br>This phrase paints a vivid picture of chaos and confusion among the Egyptian forces. The stumbling of warriors suggests a lack of coordination and the breakdown of military strength. This can be seen as a fulfillment of God's judgment, where He causes confusion among His enemies, as in <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>, where the Egyptian army is thrown into confusion during the pursuit of the Israelites. It highlights the futility of relying on human strength against divine intervention.<p><b>and both of them have fallen together.</b><br>The fall of both warriors together signifies a complete and total defeat. This can be seen as a metaphor for the collapse of Egypt's power and influence. It also serves as a reminder of the ultimate downfall of those who oppose God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>, where the wicked will perish. The phrase underscores the theme of divine justice and the certainty of God's plans prevailing over human endeavors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of God upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.
