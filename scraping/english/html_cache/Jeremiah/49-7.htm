The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all nations, including Edom. This introduction sets the stage for a divine pronouncement, highlighting the seriousness and authority of the message. The historical enmity between Edom and Israel is rooted in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where God foretells the struggle between the two nations.<p><b>Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?</b><br>Teman was a city in Edom known for its wise men, as referenced in <a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8-9</a>. The rhetorical question implies a loss of wisdom, suggesting that Edom's renowned understanding and counsel have vanished. This could be seen as a judgment against their pride and self-reliance, as wisdom is often associated with humility and the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>Has counsel perished from the prudent?</b><br>The prudent, those who are typically wise and discerning, are depicted as having lost their ability to provide sound advice. This reflects a broader theme in Scripture where human wisdom fails in the face of divine judgment (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19-20</a>). It underscores the futility of relying on human insight apart from God.<p><b>Has their wisdom decayed?</b><br>The decay of wisdom suggests a moral and spiritual decline, not just an intellectual one. This aligns with the biblical principle that true wisdom is rooted in righteousness and the knowledge of God (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13-17</a>). The decay could also symbolize the impending downfall of Edom, as their lack of wisdom leads to their destruction, fulfilling prophecies like those in Obadiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.

God foretold this moment: &#8220;Will I not in that day&#8230;destroy the wise men out of Edom?&#8221; (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>).

Obadiah had prophesied against them, probably shortly before Jeremiah's utterance, and what we find here stands in the same relation to his language as the prophecy against Moab in Jeremiah 48 does to Isaiah 15, 16. Possibly, however, as <a href="/obadiah/1-11.htm" title="In the day that you stood on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots on Jerusalem, even you were as one of them.">Obadiah 1:11</a> seems to indicate, Obadiah was the later of the two.

Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span> was celebrated for its "wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this "wisdom" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that "Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country" (<a href="/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>).
