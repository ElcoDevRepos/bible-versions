The "council of the LORD" refers to the divine assembly or heavenly court where God reveals His plans. In ancient Near Eastern culture, kings and leaders often had councils for decision-making, and this imagery is used to depict God's sovereign rule. The true prophets, like Jeremiah, were those who had access to this divine council, receiving genuine revelations from God. This echoes the experience of prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-8</a>) and Micaiah (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>), who had visions of the heavenly throne room.<p><b>to see and hear His word?</b><br>Seeing and hearing God's word implies a direct and authentic encounter with the divine message. In biblical terms, "seeing" often symbolizes understanding or perceiving spiritual truths, while "hearing" indicates obedience and attentiveness. This phrase challenges the false prophets who claimed to speak for God without having truly received His word. It underscores the importance of genuine revelation, as seen in the experiences of Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10-11</a>), who both had direct communications with God.<p><b>Who has given heed to His word and obeyed it?</b><br>This part emphasizes the necessity of not only hearing God's word but also responding to it with obedience. In the historical context, many leaders and prophets in Judah were ignoring God's commands, leading to the nation's spiritual decline. The call to heed and obey is a recurring biblical theme, seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>, where Israel is instructed to listen and act on God's laws. This obedience is a mark of true discipleship and is exemplified in the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the Father's will (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder that true prophetic ministry involves both receiving and faithfully delivering God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who communicates His will and purposes through His prophets.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals in Jeremiah's time who claimed to speak for God but did not truly stand in His council or deliver His authentic message.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_council_of_the_lord.htm">The Council of the LORD</a></b><br>A metaphorical place where God reveals His plans and purposes to His true prophets.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_true_prophetic_insight.htm">The Importance of True Prophetic Insight</a></b><br>True prophets stand in the council of the LORD, receiving and delivering His authentic message.

The verse invites us to value Scripture&#8217;s divine origin, measure every message by it, and live out what God has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The counsel.</span>--Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">the council, </span>the "assembly" of chosen friends with whom a man shares his secret plans.

Could any of the false prophets say that they had thus been called as into the privy council of Jehovah? (Comp. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm" title="Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.">Amos 3:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1Kings 22:19-23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the council</span>. This verse is connected with ver. 16; it gives the reason why the false prophets were not to be listened to. None of them had been admitted to the secret council of the Lord; the interrogation is here a form of denial. "To stand in the council" is not the same as "to sit" (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>); the latter phrase implies taking an active part in the consultations. It is specially applicable to the true prophets, according to ver. 22, and this, as we gather from other passages, m a twofold sense. Sometimes the prophets had visions, in which their inner eye was granted a sight of Jehovah in consultation with his trusted servants (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, comp. 8; <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>); and the words of Eliphaz, "Weft thou listening in the council of God?" (<a href="/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>), appear to be descriptive of a similar experience. But the phrase may also be used in a wider sense of entirely unecstatic revelations. Amos says (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), "Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret counsel unto his servants the prophets; ' and a psalmist extends the term "secret counsel" to the communion which God grants to the pious in general (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; comp. <a href="/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>). Thus there is no hard and-fast line between the experiences of the prophets and those of humbler believers. In so far as the latter are "disciples of Jehovah" (<a href="/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>), they too may be truly said to "stand," at least in the doorway, "in the council of Jehovah;" just as a well-known collect inherited from the Latin Church beseeches that "by God's holy inspiration we may think those things that he good." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath marked his word</span>? A Jewish tradition, represented by the marginal notes in the Hebrew Bible, has taken offence at this variation in the expression, and would correct the reading to "my word." But such changes of person are of frequent occurrence, and we know that the prophets were thoroughly assured that the word which they spoke was not theirs, but that of him who sent them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">which of them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has stood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;ma&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the council</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1505;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;s&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
