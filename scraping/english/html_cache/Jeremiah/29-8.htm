"LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, underscoring His power and ability to fulfill His promises. "The God of Israel" reaffirms His covenant relationship with Israel, reminding the exiles in Babylon of their unique identity and God's ongoing commitment to them. This introduction is common in prophetic literature, asserting that the message is not from human origin but from God Himself, as seen in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners among you:</b><br>During the Babylonian exile, false prophets and diviners were prevalent, offering messages of false hope and quick deliverance. These figures often claimed to speak for God but were not sent by Him, as seen in the confrontation between Jeremiah and Hananiah in <a href="/jeremiah/28.htm">Jeremiah 28</a>. The warning against deception highlights the importance of discernment and faithfulness to God's true word. In the broader biblical context, this echoes warnings against false prophets found in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a> and later in the New Testament in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>.<p><b>and do not listen to the dreams you elicit from them:</b><br>The phrase "dreams you elicit from them" suggests that the exiles were actively seeking out these false visions, perhaps out of desperation or impatience. Dreams were a common means of divine communication in the ancient Near East, but not all dreams were from God. This caution against relying on self-generated or manipulated dreams is a call to trust in God's timing and revelation.
