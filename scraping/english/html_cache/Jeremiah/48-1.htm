The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, through an incestuous relationship with his daughter (<a href="/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>). Moab had a complex relationship with Israel, sometimes allies, often enemies. This prophecy against Moab reflects the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on nations that oppose His people.<p><b>this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all armies, both heavenly and earthly. "The God of Israel" underscores His covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting that the judgment on Moab is not just a political maneuver but a divine decree. This phrase establishes the authority and seriousness of the prophecy.<p><b>&#8220;Woe to Nebo, for it will be devastated.</b><br>Nebo was a city in Moab, not to be confused with Mount Nebo where Moses viewed the Promised Land. The pronouncement of "woe" is a common prophetic expression of impending doom. The devastation of Nebo signifies the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. This aligns with other biblical prophecies where specific cities are targeted as representative of a nation's downfall (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a> concerning Babylon).<p><b>Kiriathaim will be captured and disgraced;</b><br>Kiriathaim was another significant city in Moab. Its capture and disgrace symbolize the humiliation and defeat of Moab. The mention of specific cities highlights the thoroughness of the coming judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that pride and opposition to God lead to downfall, as seen in other prophetic books like Obadiah's prophecy against Edom.<p><b>the fortress will be shattered and dismantled.</b><br>Fortresses were symbols of strength and security. The shattering and dismantling of Moab's fortress indicate the complete removal of their defenses and the futility of relying on human strength against divine judgment. This echoes the biblical theme that true security is found only in God, as seen in Psalms and Proverbs. The destruction of physical strongholds often serves as a metaphor for spiritual realities, pointing to the ultimate victory of God's kingdom over all earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>An ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.

(See Notes there.) The relations between Moab and Israel had for a long period been more or less uneasy. The former had been tributary to the latter under Ahab, but on his death Mesha revolted, and a war ensued, which ended in the defeat of the Moabites by the allied forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom (2 Kings 3).
