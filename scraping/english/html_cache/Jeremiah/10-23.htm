Jeremiah, the prophet, is speaking directly to God, indicating a relationship of intimacy and reverence. The use of "O LORD" signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature. This invocation is consistent with the prophetic tradition, where prophets often begin their declarations by affirming their awareness of God's sovereignty and wisdom. It echoes the sentiments found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-6</a>, where the psalmist acknowledges God's complete knowledge and understanding.<p><b>that a man&#8217;s way is not his own;</b><br>Here, Jeremiah acknowledges human limitations in controlling one's destiny. This reflects the biblical theme of divine sovereignty versus human free will. The phrase suggests that humans, despite their plans and desires, are ultimately subject to God's will and guidance. This is consistent with <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>, which states, "In their hearts humans plan their course, but the LORD establishes their steps." The cultural context of the time often involved reliance on divination and omens to determine one's path, but Jeremiah emphasizes trust in God's direction over human methods.<p><b>no one who walks directs his own steps.</b><br>This phrase reinforces the idea of human dependence on divine guidance. The imagery of walking suggests a journey or life path, and the inability to direct one's own steps highlights the need for God's intervention and leadership. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises believers to trust in the Lord with all their heart and not rely on their own understanding. The historical context of Jeremiah's ministry, during a time of national crisis and impending exile, underscores the importance of seeking God's direction rather than relying on human wisdom or political alliances. This reliance on God is a type of Christ, who perfectly submitted to the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, where Jesus states that He can do nothing by Himself but only what He sees the Father doing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

As <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> reminds, &#8220;Know that the LORD is God; it is He who made us, and we are His.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By beginning with knowledge of the LORD, Jeremiah models <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221; All true understanding starts here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that a man&#8217;s way is not his own</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Way&#8221; points to the course of life&#8212;plans, choices, destinations. Jeremiah insists that these do not ultimately originate with us.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> echoes this: &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps.&#8221; Human intentions are real, yet subordinate to God&#8217;s sovereign purpose.<p>&#8226; This truth counters the cultural myth of absolute self-determination. <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a> notes that God &#8220;knows our frame,&#8221; reminding us of our creaturely limits.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>no one who walks</b><p>&#8226; The phrase zooms in on daily movement&#8212;every person &#8220;who walks&#8221; through ordinary routines.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a> assures, &#8220;The steps of a man are ordered by the LORD, and He delights in his way.&#8221; Guidance is not random but lovingly personal.<p>&#8226; This applies universally; the verse leaves no room for exceptions. <a href="/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a> affirms, &#8220;In Him we live and move and have our being.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>directs his own steps</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah states the negative: we do not self-direct.

The two Hebrew words for "man" are used in the two clauses, the first expressing the weakness, the latter the strength of men. Even the strong man has to confess that he needs a hand other than his own to direct his steps.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-25.</span> - These verses confirm the view taken above, of the speaker of this whole section. Jeremiah and the people, each is, in a sense, the speaker; but here the prophetic faith seems to run rather in advance of that of his fellow-countrymen. They form, however, a fitting sequel to the charges brought against the people in <a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9</a>. The speaker admits that he (either the People of Judah personified, or Jeremiah as a representative of its best portion) fully deserves chastisement for having attempted to go his own way (comp. <a href="/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). He has now attained an insight into the truth that man's duty is simply to walk in the path which God has marked out for him. He only asks that Jehovah would chastise him <span class="cmt_word">with judgment</span>, or,, more clearly, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>. The contrast is between punishment inflicted in anger, the object of which is to cause pain to the criminal, and that inflicted as a duty of justice, and of which the object is the criminal's reformation" (Payne Smith). The fear expressed, however, is not exactly <span class="cmt_word">lest thou bring me to nothing</span>, which is too strong for the Hebrew, but lest <span class="accented">thou make me small</span>. Israel was secured against annihilation by the promise of Jehovah, but feared he might possibly survive only as the shadow of his former self. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I know,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124;
