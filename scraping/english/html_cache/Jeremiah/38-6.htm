The cistern, typically used for storing water, belonged to Malchiah, a member of the royal family, indicating the involvement of high-ranking individuals in Jeremiah's persecution. This reflects the hostility Jeremiah faced from the political and religious leaders of Judah. The act of dropping him into a cistern symbolizes the rejection of God's message, as Jeremiah was God's appointed prophet. This event foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was also rejected by the leaders of His time.<p><b>which was in the courtyard of the guard</b><br>The location of the cistern in the courtyard of the guard suggests it was a place of confinement and punishment. This setting underscores the severity of Jeremiah's situation, as he was not only imprisoned but also subjected to harsh conditions. The courtyard of the guard was likely a secure area within the palace complex, emphasizing the control and authority of those who opposed Jeremiah. This setting parallels the trials of Jesus, who was also held and judged by authorities in a courtyard setting.<p><b>They lowered Jeremiah with ropes into the cistern</b><br>The use of ropes to lower Jeremiah indicates the depth and inaccessibility of the cistern, emphasizing the intent to isolate and abandon him. This method of descent suggests a deliberate and calculated effort to ensure Jeremiah's suffering. The imagery of being lowered into a pit is reminiscent of Joseph's experience in <a href="/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>, where he was cast into a pit by his brothers, foreshadowing his eventual rise to power and deliverance. Similarly, Jeremiah's ordeal points to the theme of suffering leading to eventual vindication.<p><b>which had no water but only mud</b><br>The absence of water in the cistern signifies a place of desolation and despair. Instead of being a source of life, the cistern becomes a symbol of death and abandonment. The presence of mud highlights the physical and emotional mire Jeremiah faced, reflecting the spiritual state of Judah, which had turned away from God. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>, where the psalmist speaks of being lifted from the "miry bog," symbolizing deliverance from dire circumstances.<p><b>and Jeremiah sank down into the mud</b><br>Jeremiah's sinking into the mud illustrates his helplessness and the depth of his suffering. This physical descent into the mire can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral decline of the nation. It also prefigures the suffering of Christ, who descended into the depths of human sin and suffering to bring redemption. The image of sinking evokes the need for divine intervention, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-55.htm">Lamentations 3:55-57</a>, where the writer calls upon the Lord from the depths of the pit and is heard.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The same phrase is so translated in <a href="/1_kings/22-26.htm" title="And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;">1Kings 22:26</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-7.htm" title="And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.">2Chronicles 28:7</a>, and would seem to have been an official or court title, applied to one of the royal house, as distinguished from. others. (See Note on Jerahmeel in <a href="/jeremiah/36-26.htm" title="But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.">Jeremiah 36:26</a>.) We have no data for judging whether this Malchiah is identical with the lather of Pashur in <a href="/jeremiah/38-1.htm" title="Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,">Jeremiah 38:1</a>; but it is not unlikely. In <a href="/context/lamentations/3-53.htm" title="They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone on me.">Lamentations 3:53-55</a> we have probably a reminiscence of these days of horrible suffering. The cistern had been partly dried up (possibly through the supply of water having been cut off during the protracted siege), but there remained a thick deposit, three or four feet deep, of black foetid mud,, and there, it is obvious from <a href="/jeremiah/38-9.htm" title="My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.">Jeremiah 38:9</a> of this chapter, his enemies meant to leave him to die of hunger. They probably shrank from the odium of a public execution, or thought, with the strange superstition of the Eastern mind, that in this way they could escape the guilt of shedding the prophet's blood.

A grotto bearing the name of Jeremiah has been shown at Jerusalem since the fifteenth century. Under its floor are vast cisterns, the deepest of which professes to be the prison into which the prophet was thrown. The objection is that the sacred narrative proves that the prison was in the city, whereas "the present grotto was not included within the walls until the time of Herod Agrippa" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1881, p. 555). <span class="cmt_word">The son of Hammelech;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a royal prince</span> (as <a href="/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
