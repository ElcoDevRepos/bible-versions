Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>), symbolizing a commitment to God. Here, it is used metaphorically to indicate a need for inner purity and dedication to God. The call to circumcise "to the LORD" emphasizes a personal and communal relationship with God, urging the people to align their hearts and actions with His will.<p><b>and remove the foreskins of your hearts</b><br>The heart in biblical terms often represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Removing the "foreskins of your hearts" suggests a need for repentance and the removal of spiritual impurities. This metaphorical language is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16 and 30</a>:6, where God calls for a heart transformation. It underscores the importance of internal change over mere external compliance with religious rituals.<p><b>O men of Judah and people of Jerusalem</b><br>This addresses the inhabitants of the southern kingdom of Judah, specifically those in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center. Historically, this period was marked by idolatry and social injustice, despite the presence of the temple. The call is directed at both the leaders and the general populace, highlighting the widespread nature of the problem and the need for collective repentance.<p><b>Otherwise, My wrath will break out like fire</b><br>The imagery of fire is often used in the Bible to describe God's judgment and purifying presence (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15-16</a>, <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>). Fire represents both destruction and purification, indicating that God's wrath is both a response to sin and a means to cleanse His people. This warning serves as a call to repentance to avoid impending judgment.<p><b>and burn with no one to extinguish it</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the severity and inevitability of God's judgment if the people do not repent. The idea that no one can extinguish the fire of God's wrath underscores His sovereignty and the seriousness of the situation. It reflects the irreversible nature of divine judgment once it is set in motion, as seen in other prophetic warnings (e.g., <a href="/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a>).<p><b>because of your evil deeds.</b><br>The root cause of the impending judgment is the people's "evil deeds." This encompasses idolatry, injustice, and moral corruption prevalent in Judah at the time. The prophets consistently link divine judgment to the moral and spiritual failings of the people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder that God's judgment is just and directly related to human actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah and Jerusalem.

A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were "circumcised to the Lord." There were but too many who were "circumcised in uncircumcision" (<a href="/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (<a href="/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>).
