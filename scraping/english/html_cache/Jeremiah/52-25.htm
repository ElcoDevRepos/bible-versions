By seizing the man who could raise another army, Babylon eliminates future resistance, fulfilling the prophecy that &#8220;the strength of the mighty men of Judah will fail&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sixty men found in the city</b><p>Finally, Nebuzaradan gathers &#8220;sixty men who were found in the city.&#8221; These may be prominent citizens or remaining soldiers. Their number underlines how thoroughly Jerusalem has been emptied; only a handful remain compared with the earlier multitudes (<a href="/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13-15</a>). Their capture echoes God&#8217;s warning that the city&#8217;s inhabitants would be &#8220;few in number&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-62.htm">Deuteronomy 28:62</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/52-25.htm">Jeremiah 52:25</a> records Babylon&#8217;s systematic roundup of Jerusalem&#8217;s leadership&#8212;military, advisory, administrative, and laymen&#8212;fulfilling every prior warning the Lord had spoken through His prophet. The verse underscores God&#8217;s total sovereignty: when He decrees judgment, no rank or role can shield a person. Yet even here, Scripture drives home the reliability of God&#8217;s Word; what He promised, He performed, laying the groundwork for eventual restoration just as surely as He executed discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/52.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">An eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war.</span>--Omit the article before "charge."
