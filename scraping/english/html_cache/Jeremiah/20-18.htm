It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11</a>, where Job questions the purpose of his birth amidst suffering. Jeremiah's calling as a prophet brought him immense personal hardship, leading him to question the very purpose of his existence. This lament is not uncommon among biblical figures who faced intense trials, highlighting the human struggle with divine purpose and suffering.<p><b>to see only trouble and sorrow</b><br>Jeremiah's ministry was marked by conflict, persecution, and rejection. The "trouble and sorrow" he refers to are the direct results of his prophetic mission to a rebellious nation. This phrase can be connected to the broader theme of the suffering servant, a motif that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who also faced rejection and sorrow (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). Jeremiah's life serves as a type of Christ, prefiguring the suffering and rejection that Jesus would endure.<p><b>and to end my days in shame?</b><br>The shame Jeremiah speaks of is tied to the cultural context of honor and shame in ancient Near Eastern societies. Prophets were often ridiculed and scorned, and Jeremiah experienced this firsthand (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7-8</a>). His lament here foreshadows the shame and humiliation that Christ would bear on the cross (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). Despite the shame, both Jeremiah and Jesus remained faithful to their divine missions, demonstrating the ultimate victory of God's purposes over human disgrace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is speaking in this verse. Known as the "weeping prophet," Jeremiah often expressed deep sorrow and lament over the state of Israel and his own personal suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jeremiah prophesied.

The physical pain and public humiliation provoke this raw lament.<p>&#8226; His question echoes <a href="/job/3-11.htm">Job 3:11-19</a>, where Job also asks why he was ever born. Honest lament has a long biblical pedigree; God allows His servants to bring their anguish to Him.<p>&#8226; Yet even while questioning, Jeremiah&#8217;s life remains purpose-filled. Earlier God had told him, &#8220;Before I formed you in the womb I knew you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>). <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a> reinforces that every life begins by God&#8217;s deliberate design.<p>&#8226; The prophet is not rejecting God&#8217;s sovereignty; he is wrestling with it. Scripture records the wrestling so we can see faith persevering under pressure (<a href="/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see only trouble and sorrow</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;to see only trouble and sorrow&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-18.htm">Jeremiah 20:18</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Trouble&#8221; summarizes decades of rejection:<p>&#8211; False accusations (<a href="/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13-14</a>)<p>&#8211; Imprisonment in a cistern (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>)<p>&#8211; Constant ridicule: &#8220;I am a laughingstock all day long&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus prepared His disciples for the same reality: &#8220;In this world you will have tribulation&#8221; (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). Paul later affirmed, &#8220;We must go through many troubles to enter the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Sorrow is not the whole story. <a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a> records how God&#8217;s words also became &#8220;the joy and rejoicing of my heart.&#8221; Following Christ means both the fellowship of His sufferings (<a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>) and the comfort of His presence (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing &#8220;only&#8221; trouble feels absolute in the moment, but <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a> promises, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to end my days in shame</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and to end my days in shame?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-18.htm">Jeremiah 20:18</a>)<p>&#8226; Jeremiah fears dying disgraced, buried beneath the contempt of his nation. Shame in Scripture often reflects public scorn (<a href="/psalms/31-11.htm">Psalm 31:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; God immediately counters that fear: &#8220;But the LORD is with me like a dread warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble&#8230; their everlasting disgrace will never be forgotten&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11</a>). The shame Jeremiah dreads will ultimately land on those who reject the word of the LORD.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/50-7.htm">Isaiah 50:7</a> anticipates Messiah&#8217;s confidence: &#8220;I know I will not be put to shame.&#8221; <a href="/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11</a> applies the promise to every believer: &#8220;Everyone who believes in Him will not be put to shame.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The New Testament widens the horizon: what looks like defeat can be God&#8217;s path to honor. Jesus endured the cross, &#8220;despising the shame,&#8221; and is now exalted (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). Similarly, temporary disgrace for righteousness will be reversed in glory (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-18.htm">Jeremiah 20:18</a> records a faithful prophet at his lowest ebb, voicing the anguish of a life spent confronting sin in a hostile culture. He wonders why he was born, seeing only relentless trouble and anticipating a shameful end. Scripture responds on three levels: God ordained Jeremiah&#8217;s birth and ours; trouble is real yet never unaccompanied by divine comfort; and apparent shame will be overturned in God&#8217;s final vindication. Honest lament, endured in faith, becomes another way God proves His steadfast love and ultimate triumph.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Wherefore came I forth . . .?</span>--Like the preceding verse, this is in its tone, almost in its words, an echo of <a href="/context/job/3-11.htm" title="Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?">Job 3:11-12</a>;
