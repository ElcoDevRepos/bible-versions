The "forest" symbolizes the strength and resources of Egypt, often depicted as a place of refuge and abundance. In biblical times, forests were seen as sources of wealth and protection. The act of chopping down signifies destruction and desolation. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature where God uses natural elements to convey His judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>). The declaration by the LORD emphasizes the certainty and authority of the prophecy.<p><b>dense though it may be</b><br>The density of the forest represents the perceived invincibility and prosperity of Egypt. Despite its apparent strength and impenetrability, it will not withstand the coming judgment. This reflects the biblical theme that human power and resources are ultimately futile against God's will. The imagery of a dense forest also evokes the idea of complexity and entanglement, suggesting that Egypt's political and military might, though formidable, will be dismantled.<p><b>for they are more numerous than locusts</b><br>The comparison to locusts highlights the overwhelming number of the invaders, likely referring to the Babylonian army led by Nebuchadnezzar. Locusts are often used in the Bible as symbols of devastation and divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>). The imagery suggests an unstoppable force that consumes everything in its path, leaving desolation behind. This also connects to the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, where locusts were a sign of God's power over nations.<p><b>they cannot be counted</b><br>This phrase underscores the vastness and innumerability of the invading forces. It conveys a sense of inevitability and totality in the coming destruction. The inability to count them suggests that human efforts to resist or comprehend the scale of the invasion will be futile. This echoes other biblical passages where God's judgments are described as beyond human understanding or control (e.g., <a href="/psalms/40-5.htm">Psalm 40:5</a>). The overwhelming nature of the force serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Jeremiah was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The nation being addressed in this prophecy.
