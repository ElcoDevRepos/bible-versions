His role was significant in the Babylonian military hierarchy, and he was entrusted with executing King Nebuchadnezzar's orders. This title indicates his authority and responsibility in overseeing the capture and deportation of the people of Judah. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their military prowess and administrative efficiency, which is reflected in Nebuzaradan's position.<p><b>carried away to Babylon</b><br>The act of carrying away the people to Babylon was part of the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. This deportation fulfilled the prophecies of Jeremiah and other prophets who warned of the consequences of Judah's disobedience to God. Babylon, located in modern-day Iraq, was the center of the Babylonian Empire and a place of exile for the Jewish people. This event marked a significant shift in the Jewish experience, leading to a period of reflection and transformation.<p><b>the remnant of the people who had remained in the city</b><br>The "remnant" refers to those who survived the siege of Jerusalem. This group included the poor and those who had not been killed or fled during the Babylonian attack. The concept of a remnant is a recurring theme in the Bible, often symbolizing hope and the continuation of God's covenant with His people. Despite the destruction, God preserved a remnant to ensure the survival and eventual restoration of Israel.<p><b>along with the deserters who had defected to him</b><br>The deserters were those who had chosen to surrender to the Babylonians, possibly seeking safety or favor. This act of defection was seen as a betrayal by some, but it also fulfilled Jeremiah's counsel to surrender to the Babylonians to preserve life (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>). This phrase highlights the complex decisions faced by the people of Judah during the siege and the varying responses to the prophetic warnings.

His title, &#8220;captain of the guard,&#8221; identifies him as the direct executor of God&#8217;s foretold judgment against Judah (see <a href="/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a> and <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>). God had repeatedly warned through Jeremiah that foreign armies would act as His instrument of discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>). By highlighting this single commander, the text reminds us that earthly authorities, even pagan ones, ultimately serve God&#8217;s sovereign purposes&#8212;whether they realize it or not (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carried away to Babylon</b><p>The action phrase underlines a forced relocation, not merely a military victory. Babylon, nearly 700 miles away, becomes both a place of exile and a proving ground for faith (compare <a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-7</a>). Jeremiah had prophesied precisely this outcome (<a href="/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6-7</a>), so the carrying away demonstrates the literal fulfillment of God&#8217;s word. It also foreshadows the seventy-year captivity timetable promised in <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>, confirming God&#8217;s timeline and His faithfulness to both discipline and eventual restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The remnant of the people who had remained in the city</b><p>&#8220;Remnant&#8221; usually signals hope, yet here even the last survivors in Jerusalem are taken. They represent those who resisted earlier calls to surrender (<a href="/jeremiah/38-2.htm">Jeremiah 38:2-3</a>) and clung to city walls until famine and breach made resistance impossible (<a href="/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10-12</a>). Their capture verifies Jeremiah&#8217;s warning that staying in the city would result in sword, famine, or captivity (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>). Spiritually, this underscores that partial obedience or delayed repentance is still disobedience&#8212;God&#8217;s full word must be heeded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Along with the deserters who had defected to him</b><p>Those who switched sides earlier may have hoped to fare better, but they too are deported. This levels all social and political distinctions; only wholehearted trust in God&#8217;s instructions provides safety (<a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>). The verse pairs &#8220;remnant&#8221; and &#8220;deserters&#8221; to illustrate that human strategies&#8212;whether stubborn resistance or opportunistic surrender&#8212;cannot substitute for genuine faith and obedience. Similar leveling occurs in <a href="/2_kings/25-11.htm">2 Kings 25:11</a>, showing that God judges motives, not merely actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a> records the precise execution of God&#8217;s foretold judgment: Babylon&#8217;s commander seizes every remaining resident and even prior defectors, proving that no human plan can sidestep divine decree. The verse validates earlier prophecies, showcases God&#8217;s sovereign use of worldly powers, and affirms that true security lies in humble obedience to His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/39.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard.</span>--Here again the title in the Hebrew--<span class= "ital">Bab-tab-bachim</span>--takes a form like that of Rab-saris and Rab-shaken, and means literally, "chief of the slaughterers" The title is given to Potiphar in <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm" title="And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.">Genesis 37:36</a>, and probably answered to our "commander of the king's body-guard." The name has been interpreted as "the prince-lord, or the worshipper, of Nebo," but the etymology of the last three syllables is uncertain, He does not appear as taking part with the other generals in the siege of Jerusalem, but comes on the capture of the city, arriving a month afterwards (<a href="/jeremiah/52-12.htm" title="Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,">Jeremiah 52:12</a>) to direct, even in its minute details, the work of destruction (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm" title="And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.">2Kings 25:9</a>). The defenders and deserters were involved in the same doom of exile. It need scarcely be said that, as in the case of the conquests of Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>), Shalmaneser (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2Kings 17:6</a>), Esar-haddon (<a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>), and Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-32.htm" title="Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.">2Kings 18:32</a>), this wholesale deportation was part of the systematic policy of the great Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs. So Darius carried off the Paeonians from Thrace (Herod. v. 14). To distribute the lands of the exiles thus dispossessed among "the poor of the people," was, it was thought, likely to enlist their interests on the side of the conqueror; and, by keeping up the cultivation of the soil, secured the payment of tribute. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nebuzar-adan;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="accented">Nabu-zira-iddina</span>, "Nebo gave a seed." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1514;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
