In the historical context of Jeremiah, many prophets claimed to speak for God, yet they delivered messages that contradicted His true word. These false prophets often assured the people of peace and safety when judgment was imminent (<a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>). The use of "in My name" indicates the seriousness of their offense, as they were misusing God's authority to lend credibility to their deceit. This echoes the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a> about the severe consequences for those who falsely claim to speak for God.<p><b>&#8216;I had a dream! I had a dream!&#8217;</b><br>Dreams were a common means of divine communication in the ancient Near East, as seen in the stories of Joseph (Genesis 37) and Daniel (Daniel 2). However, in this context, the repetition of "I had a dream" suggests a mocking tone, emphasizing the emptiness and frequency of these false claims. The false prophets were using dreams to assert their authority and mislead the people, similar to how false teachers might misuse spiritual experiences today. This phrase also contrasts with the true prophetic dreams given by God, which were rare and significant, serving His purposes and aligning with His revealed word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals claiming to speak on behalf of God but delivering messages that are not from Him, often for personal gain or to mislead the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was often the focus of Jeremiah's prophecies due to its persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dreams.htm">Dreams</a></b><br>In the context of this verse, dreams are used by false prophets as a means to claim divine revelation, though they are deceitful.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who hears and judges the false claims made in His name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_prophecy.htm">Discernment in Prophecy</a></b><br>Believers must exercise discernment when evaluating claims of divine revelation.

Dreams took their place among the recognised channels of divine revelation (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm" title="And they said to him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said to them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.">Genesis 40:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/41-16.htm" title="And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.">Genesis 41:16</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-1.htm" title="In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.">Daniel 7:1</a>), but their frequent misuse by the false prophets brought them into discredit, and the teaching of <a href="/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a> accordingly brought the "dreamer of dreams" no less than the prophet to the test whether what he taught was in accordance with the law of Jehovah. The iteration of "I have dreamed" represents the affected solemnity with which the false prophets proclaimed their visions. Of the disparagement of dreams, consequent on this abuse, we have a striking example in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-3.htm" title="For a dream comes through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a>, and later still in <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/34-1.htm" title="The hopes of a man void of understanding are vain and false: and dreams lift up fools.">Ecclesiasticus 34:1-7</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have dreamed</span>. Jeremiah mentions it as one of the marks of a false prophet that he appealed to his dreams (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>); true prophecy contented itself with less ambiguous media of communication with the unseen world. It may be objected that Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), at any rate, and Abimelech (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) received Divine revelations in dreams; but these were not officially prophets. Nathan and the contemporaries of the author of Job had messages from God by night, but these are called, not dreams, but visions (<a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, comp. 17; <a href="/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). Deuteronomy (and this is one of its striking points of agreement with Jeremiah) expressly describes a false prophet as "a dreamer of dreams" (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). Two passages in the Old Testament seem inconsistent with this discouragement of dreams as a medium of revelation - <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, where the Lord is said to make himself known to prophets by visions and dreams, and <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where the prophetic dreams of the old men are one of the features of a Messianic description; but it is noteworthy that the first of these refers to the primitive period of Israel's history, and the second to the distant Messianic age. In its classical period prophecy kept itself sedulously aloof from a field on which it had such compromising companionship (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sayings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the prophets</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1488;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7687;i&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
