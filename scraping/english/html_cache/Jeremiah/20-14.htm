This phrase echoes <a href="/job/3.htm">Job 3:1-3</a>, where Job curses the day of his birth amidst his suffering. The expression of cursing one's birth highlights the intense emotional and spiritual turmoil faced by those chosen to deliver God's messages, often met with rejection and persecution. Jeremiah's ministry was marked by opposition, and this lament reveals the human side of a prophet grappling with the weight of his mission.<p><b>May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.</b><br>This continuation of the curse emphasizes the depth of Jeremiah's distress. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the birth of a child, especially a male, was typically a cause for celebration and blessing. By wishing that his birth never be blessed, Jeremiah is expressing a profound sense of regret and sorrow over his existence and the suffering it has brought him. This sentiment can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced rejection and suffering despite being the bearer of God's message. The lamentation here is not just personal but reflects the broader rejection of God's word by the people of Judah, highlighting the prophet's role as a suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is expressing deep anguish and despair in this verse.

He is not rejecting God&#8217;s gift of life; rather, he is venting deep anguish over the painful circumstances that have marked his life from the start.<p>&#8226; Scripture often records God-honoring people pouring out honest lament. Job cried, &#8220;May the day I was born perish&#8221; (<a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>), and even Moses once asked God to take his life (<a href="/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14-15</a>). Their transparency shows that raw emotion can coexist with authentic faith.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah&#8217;s outburst also exposes the high cost of obedience. Earlier he confessed, &#8220;Your word has brought me reproach&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/15-15.htm">Jeremiah 15:15</a>). His curse on his birthday is less about life itself and more about the suffering attached to his prophetic calling (compare <a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice he addresses the day, not God. The prophet never denies the Lord&#8217;s goodness; he simply loathes the misery tied to his entrance into a hostile world&#8212;a world that refuses to heed God&#8217;s truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the day my mother bore me never be blessed.</b><p>Jeremiah intensifies his lament by wishing the date of his birth could be erased from the calendar of blessings. He longs for a reality where that day would draw no celebration because his painful ministry would never have been needed.<p>&#8226; This longing echoes other moments when people of God felt their burden too heavy. David wrote, &#8220;My guilt has overwhelmed me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>), and Elijah despaired, &#8220;I am no better than my fathers&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). Such parallels remind us that spiritual giants wrestle with discouragement.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah is not cursing his mother; instead, he wishes that the day of his birth had never occurred, sparing both of them grief. Contrast this with the biblical call to honor parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>); the prophet&#8217;s lament underscores his emotional turmoil, not a violation of God&#8217;s command.<p>&#8226; God does not rebuke Jeremiah here. The Lord understands human frailty (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13-14</a>) and later renews the prophet&#8217;s strength, confirming that honest lament can lead to deeper reliance on God&#8217;s sustaining grace (<a href="/jeremiah/20-11.htm">Jeremiah 20:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14</a> captures the prophet&#8217;s raw lament after relentless persecution. By cursing the day of his birth, he voices profound sorrow over the suffering attached to his divine calling, much like Job, Moses, and Elijah did in their darkest hours. Yet even in this anguish, Jeremiah neither curses God nor abandons faith; instead, he models transparent dependence on the Lord who understands and ultimately comforts His servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Cursed be the day wherein I was born . . .</span>--The apparent strangeness of this relapse from the confidence of the two previous verses into a despair yet deeper than before is best explained by the supposition that it is in no sense part of the same poem or meditation, but a distinct fragment belonging to the same period, and placed in its present position by Jeremiah himself, or by the first editor of his prophecies. By some, indeed, it has been thought that we have here an accidental dislocation, and that <a href="/context/jeremiah/20-14.htm" title="Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed.">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a> should stand before <a href="/jeremiah/20-7.htm" title="O LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocks me.">Jeremiah 20:7</a>. The prophet utters a cry of anguish yet keener than that which now precedes it, and borrows the language of that cry from the book of Job (<a href="/jeremiah/3-3.htm" title="Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.">Jeremiah 3:3</a>). The prophet turned in the depth of his suffering to the words in which the great representative of sufferers had <span class= "ital">"</span>cursed his day." The question whether we are to blame or to palliate such utterances, how far they harmonise with Christian feeling, is one on which we need not dwell long. It is enough to note (1) that, while we cannot make for them the half-evasive apology which sees in Jeremiah's prayers against his enemies, and in the imprecatory psalms, prophecies rather than prayers, they indicate the same temper as those psalms and prayers indicate when taken in their natural sense, and so help us to understand them; and (2) that in such cases, while we give thanks that we have the blessing of a higher law and the example of a higher life, we are not called upon to apportion praise or blame. It is enough to reverence, to sympathise, to be silent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-18.</span> - Jeremiah curses the day of his birth. The passage is a further development of the complaint in <a href="/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and stands in no connection with the consolatory close of the preceding passage. There is a very striking parallel in <a href="/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-12</a>, and the question cannot be evaded, Which is the original? It is difficult to believe that Jeremiah copied from an earlier poem. Deep emotion expresses itself in language suggested by the moment; and, even after retouching his discourses, Jeremiah would leave much of the original expression. But impressions of this sort cannot be unreservedly trusted. The argument from parallel passages is only a subsidiary one in the determination of the date of books. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Cursed be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;r&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_779.htm">Strong's 779: </a> </span><span class="str2">To execrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
