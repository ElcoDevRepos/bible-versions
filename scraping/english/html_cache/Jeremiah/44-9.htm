The "fathers" refers to the ancestors of the Israelites, who often turned away from God despite His repeated warnings through prophets. This is reminiscent of passages like <a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10-12</a>, where a new generation arose that did not know the Lord or His works, leading to idolatry.<p><b>and of the kings of Judah and their wives</b><br>The kings of Judah, such as Manasseh and Amon, were notorious for leading the nation into idolatry and other sins. Their wives often played significant roles in promoting pagan worship, as seen with Queen Jezebel's influence over King Ahab in the northern kingdom of Israel. This highlights the impact of leadership and the influence of those in power on the spiritual state of a nation.<p><b>as well as the wickedness that you and your wives committed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal accountability, indicating that the current generation is also guilty of similar sins. It reflects the biblical principle that each individual is responsible for their own actions, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, which states that the soul who sins shall die. The inclusion of "your wives" suggests that the family unit as a whole was complicit in these transgressions.<p><b>in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem</b><br>The mention of specific locations underscores the gravity of the sin, as Judah and Jerusalem were central to the identity and worship of the Israelites. Jerusalem, being the site of the Temple, was supposed to be a place of holiness and devotion to God. The reference to "streets" suggests that the wickedness was public and widespread, not hidden or isolated, indicating a societal departure from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fathers_of_judah.htm">Fathers of Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the ancestors of the people of Judah who engaged in idolatry and disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_judah.htm">Kings of Judah</a></b><br>The rulers who led the nation in practices contrary to God's commands, often promoting idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wives_of_judah.htm">Wives of Judah</a></b><br>The women of Judah who participated in and supported the idolatrous practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_judah.htm">Land of Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where these acts of wickedness took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/streets_of_jerusalem.htm">Streets of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, symbolizing the heart of the nation's spiritual and moral decline.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting past sins and God's deliverance can lead to repeated disobedience.
