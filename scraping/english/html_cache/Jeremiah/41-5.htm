The act of cutting oneself, however, was generally prohibited in Israelite law (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), suggesting these men might have been influenced by surrounding pagan practices or were in extreme distress. The number eighty may symbolize completeness or a significant group, though not necessarily a literal count.<p><b>came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria</b><br>These locations are significant in Israel's history. Shechem was an ancient city of refuge and a place of covenant renewal (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). Shiloh was the early religious center where the tabernacle was located before the temple was built in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>). Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, often represented apostasy and idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). The mention of these places suggests a gathering of Israelites from regions with deep historical and religious significance, possibly indicating a remnant of faithful worshippers.<p><b>carrying grain offerings and frankincense for the house of the LORD</b><br>Grain offerings were part of the Levitical sacrificial system, symbolizing dedication and thanksgiving to God (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>). Frankincense, a costly and fragrant resin, was used in the temple for incense offerings (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). The mention of these offerings indicates an intention to worship and honor God, despite the destruction of the temple. This act of bringing offerings to the house of the LORD, even in its absence, reflects a continued devotion and hope for restoration. The use of frankincense also foreshadows its later association with the worship of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighty_men.htm">Eighty Men</a></b><br>These men were pilgrims coming to worship at the temple, demonstrating their devotion despite the political turmoil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem,_shiloh,_and_samaria.htm">Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria</a></b><br>These are significant locations in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, each with historical and religious importance.

They are enough to form a caravan yet not enough to defend themselves, foreshadowing vulnerability to Ishmael&#8217;s treachery (<a href="/jeremiah/41-6.htm">Jeremiah 41:6&#8211;7</a>). Similar remnant-sized groups appear elsewhere&#8212;compare <a href="/nehemiah/7-66.htm">Nehemiah 7:66</a>, where a counted remnant seeks renewed worship. The number underscores that, though judgment has fallen, some hearts still turn toward the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shaved off their beards</b><p>In the Ancient Near East a beard symbolized dignity; shaving it off expressed deep mourning or disgrace. <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a> show Moab shaving heads and beards in grief. Here, the men&#8217;s shaven faces confess national humiliation after Jerusalem&#8217;s fall, aligning with <a href="/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4-5</a>, where shamed men hide until their beards grow back. Their outward loss mirrors Judah&#8217;s spiritual collapse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Torn garments</b><p>Tearing clothing dramatized sorrow or repentance. Jacob tore his robe over Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>); Job tore his cloak when catastrophe struck (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). These worshipers likewise publicize heartbreak over the desolation of Zion. The gesture matches God&#8217;s call to &#8220;rend your heart and not your garments&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>), hinting that true repentance must accompany the visible sign.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cut themselves</b><p>Self-laceration was a pagan mourning rite forbidden to Israel (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>). The prophets Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a>; 47:5) decried it. That these pilgrims bear such wounds reveals how syncretism had seeped into the northern regions. Yet even through flawed practices they seek the LORD&#8212;a poignant picture of mixed devotion needing grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria</b><p>These cities represent the old northern kingdom (Ephraim/Israel).<p>&#8226; Shechem&#8212;historic covenant site (<a href="/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>) and later a center of idolatry (<a href="/bsb/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>).<p>&#8226; Shiloh&#8212;earlier tabernacle location, abandoned after judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Samaria&#8212;capital of the fallen northern realm (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>).<p>Pilgrims from such places show that God still has a remnant beyond Judah (<a href="/jeremiah/31-6.htm">Jeremiah 31:6</a>), fulfilling the promise that scattered Israelites would seek Him again.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Carrying grain offerings and frankincense</b><p><a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1-2</a> prescribes fine flour with frankincense as a &#8220;soothing aroma&#8221; to the LORD. Bringing these costly items after Jerusalem&#8217;s ruin displays costly faith. <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> prays that God &#8220;remember all your grain offerings.&#8221; Their gifts are tangible evidence that worship has not been extinguished.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the house of the LORD</b><p>Though the temple lay charred (<a href="/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), the phrase shows Jerusalem remains the spiritual axis. <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-6</a> had appointed one place of worship; their journey confesses that only the LORD&#8217;s house&#8212;however damaged&#8212;can satisfy covenant longing (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>). Tragically, Ishmael&#8217;s massacre (<a href="/jeremiah/41-7.htm">Jeremiah 41:7</a>) turns their pious trek into martyrdom, reinforcing the darkness of the era and the need for God&#8217;s promised new covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a> paints a vivid tableau of eighty northern Israelites: visibly mourning&#8212;shaved, torn, cut&#8212;yet still trekking to the devastated temple with grain and frankincense. Their outward grief acknowledges national sin and loss; their mixed practices show lingering compromise; their offerings and destination reveal enduring faith. The verse teaches that even in judgment God preserves a remnant whose imperfect devotion reaches toward Him, anticipating the fuller restoration He alone will provide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">There came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria.</span>--The LXX. gives Salem instead of Shiloh, and this agrees better with the order of the names, Salem being a tower or fortress near Shechem (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>), while Shiloh lay further off. The eighty travellers were coming apparently on a pilgrimage of mourning to the ruins of the Temple, perhaps to keep the Feast of Tabernacles in the hope of finding at least an altar there on which they might present their oblations. Mizpah lay directly on their road from all three places. It is significant that they bring with them not burnt offerings but the <span class= "ital">mincha, </span>or meat offering, the cakes of flour with incense. The outward signs of mourning were, perhaps, connected either with the approaching Day of Atonement, which fell in the seventh month; or with some special fast day belonging to the same season (<a href="/zechariah/7-5.htm" title="Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?">Zechariah 7:5</a>); or in token of their sorrow for the destruction of the Temple. In the signs themselves we note a relapse into a half-heathen custom which the Law had forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-37.htm" title="For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands shall be cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.">Jeremiah 48:37</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/41.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There came certain from Shechem,</span> etc. A number of pious pilgrims, descend. ants of the old ten tribes, passed by on their way to the holy site of the temple at Jerusalem (?)

Hence Thenius and Gratz have conjectured that Gedaliah had erected a provisional temple at Mizpah, which was already hallowed by its association with the Prophet Samuel. This is confirmed by 1 Macc. 3:46, where it is said of the pious Jews in the Maccabean rising, that they "assembled themselves... and came to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">eighty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8084.htm">Strong's 8084: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eighty, eightieth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1440;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who had shaved off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1490;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7713;ul&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1548.htm">Strong's 1548: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bald, to shave, to lay waste</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their beards,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;q&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2206.htm">Strong's 2206: </a> </span><span class="str2">Beard, chin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">torn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;q&#601;&#183;ru&#183;&#8216;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
