The prophet warns the people to be cautious even with those who are close to them. This mirrors the societal breakdown described in <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5-6</a>, where trust is eroded within families and communities. The call to "guard" suggests a defensive posture, indicating the pervasive nature of deceit and betrayal. Historically, this period was marked by political instability and idolatry, leading to a breakdown in social cohesion.<p><b>do not trust any brother,</b><br>The term "brother" here extends beyond familial ties to include fellow Israelites, emphasizing the widespread nature of treachery. This reflects the covenant community's failure to uphold the values of loyalty and truthfulness. In <a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>, Cain's betrayal of Abel is an early example of fraternal distrust, highlighting the recurring theme of broken relationships due to sin. The admonition not to trust even a brother underscores the severity of the moral crisis facing Judah.<p><b>for every brother deals craftily,</b><br>The word "craftily" suggests deceit and cunning, reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>. This behavior is contrary to the covenantal expectations of honesty and integrity among God's people. The Hebrew term used here can also imply treachery, indicating a deliberate intent to deceive. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of humanity's propensity for sin and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>and every friend spreads slander.</b><br>Slander, or false accusations, is condemned throughout Scripture as destructive to community and individual relationships (<a href="/proverbs/10-18.htm">Proverbs 10:18</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, reputation and honor were paramount, making slander a particularly grievous offense. This phrase highlights the breakdown of trust and the prevalence of malicious speech, which is also addressed in the New Testament (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). The pervasive nature of slander in Jeremiah's time foreshadows the need for a new covenant, as prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

God is not endorsing paranoia; He is exposing a society so corrupted by sin that basic social trust had evaporated.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/psalms/101-7.htm">Psalm 101:7</a> David vows that &#8220;No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house,&#8221; underscoring God&#8217;s call to vigilance when deceit becomes normal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5&#8211;6</a> paints a similar picture: &#8220;Do not trust a neighbor; put no confidence in a friend,&#8221; showing that Jeremiah&#8217;s warning was not isolated but part of a broader prophetic indictment.<p>God&#8217;s people were to be alert, not because suspicion itself is virtuous, but because sin had so saturated daily life that guarding one&#8217;s heart and conduct became essential for survival and holiness (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not trust any brother</b><p>&#8220;Do not trust any brother&#8221; points to a breakdown even within family ties. When covenant standards collapse, kinship loses its reliability.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6&#8211;8</a>, Israel was warned that even a &#8220;brother, the son of your mother&#8221; might entice you to idolatry, reminding us that loyalty to God supersedes familial loyalty when the two conflict.<p>&#8226; Jesus later acknowledged this painful reality, noting that &#8220;a man&#8217;s enemies will be the members of his own household&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34&#8211;36</a>).<p>Jeremiah highlights that sin&#8217;s reach can pervert the very bonds God designed for security and encouragement, urging discernment over blind trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for every brother deals craftily</b><p>Jeremiah specifies the reason for distrust: &#8220;every brother deals craftily.&#8221; The word pictures a habitual, calculated deceit rather than occasional failure.<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s early life illustrates craftiness between brothers (<a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>), showing how deception strains relationships.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24&#8211;26</a> cautions that &#8220;a hateful man disguises himself with his speech,&#8221; reinforcing Jeremiah&#8217;s assessment that some people intentionally manipulate.<p>The verse reminds believers to weigh character and fruit (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16&#8211;17</a>) rather than titles or relationships when assessing trustworthiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every friend spreads slander</b><p>The corruption extends to friendships: &#8220;every friend spreads slander.&#8221; Gossip and false accusation poison community life and reflect hearts alienated from truth.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> laments, &#8220;Even my close friend&#8230;has lifted up his heel against me,&#8221; a foreshadowing of Judas&#8217;s betrayal of Christ (<a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a> warns that &#8220;a perverse man spreads strife, and a gossip separates close friends,&#8221; echoing Jeremiah&#8217;s observation.<p>Slander not only wounds reputations; it reveals an alliance with &#8220;the accuser of our brothers&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).

The verse is a sober diagnostic: when people abandon God&#8217;s truth, relational bonds decay. For believers today, the passage calls for vigilant discernment, commitment to integrity, and faithfulness to God above all human loyalties, while we pray and labor for hearts transformed by the gospel so that trust and truth can flourish once again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Take ye heed . . .</span>--The extreme bitterness of the prophet's words is explained in part by what we read afterwards of his personal history (<a href="/jeremiah/12-6.htm" title="For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; yes, they have called a multitude after you: believe them not, though they speak fair words to you.">Jeremiah 12:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm" title="Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.

Every brother Israelite is found to be a thorough-paced Jacob.

Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were "the salt" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">Every brother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. <span class="cmt_word">Will utterly supplant</span>.
