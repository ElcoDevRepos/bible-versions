Historically, Zedekiah was the last king of Judah before the Babylonian exile. The phrase underscores the inevitability of God's judgment due to the nation's persistent disobedience. The grasp refers to the power and reach of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was God's instrument of judgment. This reflects the broader biblical theme of divine sovereignty over nations and rulers.<p><b>but will surely be captured and delivered into his hand</b><br>The certainty of Zedekiah's capture is emphasized here. The phrase "delivered into his hand" suggests divine orchestration, where God allows Nebuchadnezzar to succeed as part of His judgment against Judah. This aligns with the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah, who consistently called for repentance. The historical context shows that despite alliances and attempts to resist, Judah could not withstand Babylon's might, fulfilling God's prophetic word.<p><b>You will see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face</b><br>This prophecy indicates a personal encounter between Zedekiah and Nebuchadnezzar, highlighting the humiliation and accountability Zedekiah would face. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeing a conqueror "eye to eye" was a sign of submission and defeat. This encounter is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-7</a>, where Zedekiah is captured and brought before Nebuchadnezzar, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy. The phrase also underscores the personal nature of God's judgment, where leaders are held accountable for their actions.<p><b>and you will go to Babylon</b><br>This final phrase confirms the exile of Zedekiah to Babylon, a significant event in Jewish history. The Babylonian exile was a pivotal moment, marking the end of the Davidic reign in Jerusalem until the coming of Christ. Theologically, it represents the consequences of covenant unfaithfulness. The exile is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus would later fulfill the role of the true King who restores and redeems His people, bringing them back from spiritual exile.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s word removes every illusion of safety: &#8220;Though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>). Zedekiah&#8217;s eventual attempt to flee by night through a breach in Jerusalem&#8217;s wall (<a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>) only confirms that God&#8217;s warning was literally fulfilled. The lesson is unmistakable: when the Lord decrees judgment, human ingenuity cannot outrun it (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but will surely be captured and delivered into his hand</b><p>The double assurance&#8212;&#8220;surely be captured&#8221;&#8212;reinforces certainty. The prophet had already said, &#8220;He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he will remain&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-5.htm">Jeremiah 32:5</a>). That capture comes through the Babylonians at Riblah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>). Scripture often pairs divine sovereignty with very specific historical detail (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17&#8211;20</a>), underscoring that God governs both the broad sweep of nations and the exact fate of one man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will see the king of Babylon eye to eye</b><p>Personal confrontation replaces distant rumor. Standing face-to-face with Nebuchadnezzar forces Zedekiah to acknowledge the authority he once despised (<a href="/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>). Similar moments appear elsewhere: Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/10-28.htm">Exodus 10:28&#8211;29</a>), Paul before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26-1.htm">Acts 26:1&#8211;3</a>). God orchestrates these encounters to display His justice publicly. In Zedekiah&#8217;s case the meeting occurs at Riblah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and speak with him face to face</b><p>Conversation implies interrogation and judgment. According to <a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6&#8211;7</a>, Nebuchadnezzar passes sentence after dialogue, then orders Zedekiah&#8217;s sons killed and the king&#8217;s eyes put out. God&#8217;s word was exact: Zedekiah would see Nebuchadnezzar&#8212;then see no more. His last visual memory is the execution of his heirs, a tragic picture of sin&#8217;s cost (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will go to Babylon</b><p>The route ends in exile, mirroring Judah&#8217;s national punishment (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). Ezekiel, prophesying from Babylon, adds the striking detail that Zedekiah &#8220;will not see it&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>); after his blinding, he travels sightless to the city. Yet even in judgment God preserves life, fulfilling His earlier word that Zedekiah would die in peace and be mourned (<a href="/jeremiah/34-4.htm">Jeremiah 34:4&#8211;5</a>). Captivity is severe, but mercy threads through it, proving God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant promises (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a> delivers a five-fold prophecy that unpacks the certainty, specificity, and purpose of God&#8217;s judgment on King Zedekiah. He will not escape; he will be captured; he will meet Nebuchadnezzar; he will converse with him; he will be exiled to Babylon. Every detail came to pass, demonstrating the absolute reliability of God&#8217;s word, the futility of resisting His declared plan, and the intertwining of justice and mercy even in the darkest moments of Israel&#8217;s history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
