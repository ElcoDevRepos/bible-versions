"LORD God of Hosts" refers to God's command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His power and majesty. The title "God of Israel" highlights His covenant relationship with the nation of Israel, reminding the people of their unique identity and responsibilities as His chosen people. This introduction sets the stage for a divine pronouncement, demanding attention and reverence.<p><b>Why are you doing such great harm to yourselves:</b><br>The rhetorical question points to the self-destructive behavior of the people. Historically, the Israelites often turned to idolatry and disobedience, leading to their downfall. This phrase suggests that their actions are not only against God but also detrimental to their own well-being. It reflects the biblical principle that sin leads to suffering and separation from God, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>by cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant:</b><br>This phrase indicates the severe consequences of the people's actions, leading to the decimation of the population. Historically, the Babylonian conquest resulted in significant loss of life and exile. The mention of "man and woman, child and infant" underscores the totality of the destruction, affecting all demographics. This echoes the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity.<p><b>leaving yourselves without a remnant:</b><br>The concept of a "remnant" is significant in biblical theology, often referring to a faithful group preserved by God despite widespread judgment. Here, the warning is that their continued rebellion could result in the absence of such a remnant, threatening the survival of the nation. This connects to prophecies in Isaiah and other prophets where a remnant is preserved for future restoration. The absence of a remnant would mean the loss of hope for renewal and fulfillment of God's promises to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is addressing His people through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who is delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is facing judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>The recipients of the message, who are engaging in practices that lead to their own destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where many of the Judeans have fled, seeking refuge but continuing in idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God leads to self-destruction.
