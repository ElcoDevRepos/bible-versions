These words were a direct message from God, warning of impending judgment due to the people's disobedience. The context is crucial as it highlights the gravity of the message, which was meant to provoke repentance. The scroll was read in the presence of King Jehoiakim, who was ruling during a tumultuous period in Judah's history, marked by political instability and spiritual decline.<p><b>the king and his servants</b><br>King Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, was known for his rebellion against God and his alliance with Egypt. His reign was characterized by idolatry and injustice. The "servants" likely refer to his officials and advisors, who were complicit in his actions. This group represents the leadership of Judah, who were responsible for guiding the nation spiritually and politically. Their response to the prophetic message is indicative of their hardened hearts and unwillingness to heed God's warnings.<p><b>did not become frightened</b><br>The lack of fear in response to God's words is significant. In biblical times, fear of the Lord was considered the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The absence of fear suggests a deep spiritual insensitivity and arrogance. This reaction contrasts with other biblical figures who responded with fear and repentance when confronted with God's judgment, such as the people of Nineveh in the book of Jonah.<p><b>or tear their garments</b><br>Tearing one's garments was a traditional expression of mourning, repentance, or distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It was a physical manifestation of inner turmoil and a sign of humility before God. The fact that neither the king nor his servants tore their garments indicates a refusal to acknowledge their sin or the seriousness of the prophetic message. This lack of response is a stark contrast to King Josiah, Jehoiakim's father, who tore his garments upon hearing the Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>) and led a national reform.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah, often warning them of impending judgment due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_jehoiakim.htm">King Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his disregard for God's word and his rebellious actions against the prophetic messages delivered by Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baruch.htm">Baruch</a></b><br>Jeremiah's scribe, who wrote down the words of the prophecy as dictated by Jeremiah and read them to the people and officials.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The central place of worship in Jerusalem where Baruch read the scroll to the people, highlighting the importance of the message being delivered in a sacred space.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>The written record of Jeremiah's prophecies, which was read aloud to the people and later destroyed by King Jehoiakim, symbolizing his rejection of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reverence_for_god's_word.htm">The Importance of Reverence for God's Word</a></b><br>The indifference of Jehoiakim and his servants serves as a warning against taking God's word lightly.

In the immediate context (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>), King Jehoiakim had just cut up Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll and burned it piece by piece. One would expect immediate repentance, as happened when Nineveh heard Jonah (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>) or when Judah&#8217;s earlier king Hezekiah humbled himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-26.htm">2 Chronicles 32:26</a>). Instead, the inspired narrator pauses with &#8220;Yet&#8221; to highlight stubborn indifference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In hearing all these words</b><p>- These were not mere human opinions; they were &#8220;all the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah&#8217;s dictation&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4, 32</a>).<p>- Scripture teaches that &#8220;faith comes by hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), and that we are to &#8220;be doers of the word, and not hearers only&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Jehoiakim and his officials heard every syllable, so they were fully accountable.<p>- God repeatedly says, &#8220;He who has ears, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>). Hearing brings responsibility; ignoring it invites judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king and his servants</b><p>- Leadership matters. When a nation&#8217;s head resists God, followers often imitate him (<a href="/proverbs/29-12.htm">Proverbs 29:12</a>).<p>- Contrast Jehoiakim with his ancestor Josiah: &#8220;When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11</a>). One king trembled; the other scoffed.<p>- Jehoiakim&#8217;s servants shared the guilt. <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a> shows God looks for even one individual to &#8220;stand in the gap.&#8221; No one in this court did.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Did not become frightened</b><p>- &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Refusing to fear God is spiritual insanity.<p>- Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll contained dire warnings&#8212;sword, famine, pestilence (<a href="/jeremiah/36-29.htm">Jeremiah 36:29</a>). Yet they felt nothing.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a> says God looks to the one &#8220;who trembles at My word.&#8221; Their lack of fear reveals hardened hearts (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or tear their garments</b><p>- In Old Testament culture, tearing one&#8217;s clothes showed grief and repentance (<a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a>).<p>- By noting what did not happen, the verse underscores their callousness. Josiah tore his garments and sparked nationwide reform (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-19.htm">2 Chronicles 34:19</a>). Jehoiakim did the opposite, escalating national rebellion.<p>- Genuine contrition involves both heart and action (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>, &#8220;Rend your hearts and not your garments&#8221;). Jehoiakim exhibited neither.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-24.htm">Jeremiah 36:24</a> exposes the chilling indifference of King Jehoiakim and his court. Though they plainly heard God&#8217;s warnings, they chose defiance over fear, pride over repentance. Their failure to tremble or tear garments stands as a sober reminder: hearing God&#8217;s Word without humble response hardens the heart and invites judgment. May we, unlike Jehoiakim, receive Scripture with reverent fear and immediate obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24-25) <span class= "bld">Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments . . .</span>--If we suppose that the "servants" are identical with the princes, these were the very men who, when they first heard the words, had been afraid, "both one and other."
