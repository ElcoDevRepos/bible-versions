The officials here refer to the Judean leaders who were part of King Jehoiakim's court. These officials were aware of the political and religious implications of Jeremiah's prophecies, which often called for repentance and warned of impending judgment. Their decision to speak to Baruch indicates their recognition of the seriousness of the message he had delivered on behalf of Jeremiah.<p><b>&#8220;You and Jeremiah must hide yourselves</b><br>The command to hide reflects the dangerous political climate in Jerusalem at the time. Jeremiah's prophecies were not well-received by the ruling authorities, as they often predicted the downfall of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. The officials' advice to hide suggests that they understood the threat posed by King Jehoiakim, who had previously shown hostility towards Jeremiah's messages. This situation highlights the tension between God's prophets and the political powers of the day, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>and tell no one where you are.&#8221;</b><br>This instruction underscores the need for secrecy and protection. The officials likely feared that if Jeremiah and Baruch were found, they would face severe punishment or even death. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's protection over His messengers, as seen in other instances where prophets were shielded from harm (e.g., Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>). The need for secrecy also emphasizes the gravity of the prophetic message and the lengths to which God's servants must sometimes go to ensure its preservation and delivery.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

Like the officials in <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a> who sat &#8220;in the new gate of the LORD&#8217;s house&#8221; to hear prophetic charges, these leaders stand at a decisive intersection of truth and power. Their reverence for the message shows that God&#8217;s word pierces even palace walls (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said to Baruch,</b><p>Addressing the scribe rather than the prophet underscores Baruch&#8217;s vital role. Earlier they had asked him, &#8220;Tell us now, how did you write all these words?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/36-17.htm">Jeremiah 36:17&#8211;18</a>). God often works through &#8220;faithful men&#8221; who handle His word accurately (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>). Just as Hilkiah handed the rediscovered Law to Shaphan the scribe in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-15.htm">2 Chronicles 34:15&#8211;18</a>, Baruch carries the revelation entrusted to him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You and Jeremiah</b><p>The officials speak of the pair as a single unit, recognizing their shared mission. Baruch penned what Jeremiah heard from God (<a href="/jeremiah/36-4.htm">Jeremiah 36:4</a>). The scene illustrates <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>: &#8220;Men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Partnership in obedience magnifies the testimony (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>must hide yourselves</b><p>Their counsel is protective, not cowardly. Kings who reject Scripture often lash out (<a href="/jeremiah/36-23.htm">Jeremiah 36:23</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3&#8211;10</a>). Earlier, the prophet Uriah was hunted down and killed for similar words (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20&#8211;23</a>). God sometimes commands flight: &#8220;When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>). Obedience can include strategic retreat, as when Elijah hid by the brook (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>) or Paul escaped Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell no one where you are.</b><p>Secrecy serves the preservation of the message. <a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a> notes, &#8220;The prudent see danger and take cover.&#8221; Jesus Himself &#8220;would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-1.htm">John 7:1</a>). Silence here is not denial but wisdom, ensuring the word remains available for God&#8217;s appointed time (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/36-19.htm">Jeremiah 36:19</a> shows palace officials acting on conviction: they recognize God&#8217;s word, protect its messengers, and advise prudent concealment.
