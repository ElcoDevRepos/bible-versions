The term "abomination" often refers to idolatry and practices detestable to God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>. The rhetorical question implies a lack of repentance and awareness of sin, echoing the spiritual insensitivity found in <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>. The historical context involves Judah's persistent idolatry despite prophetic warnings, reflecting a hardened heart similar to that of Pharaoh in Exodus.<p><b>No, they have no shame at all;</b><br>This statement highlights the people's complete moral desensitization. In ancient Near Eastern culture, shame was a powerful social force, yet here it is absent. This mirrors the condition described in <a href="/zephaniah/3-5.htm">Zephaniah 3:5</a>, where justice is perverted. The lack of shame indicates a deep spiritual decay, akin to the state of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.<p><b>they do not even know how to blush.</b><br>Blushing signifies an innate sense of guilt or embarrassment, which is absent here. This phrase suggests a total loss of moral compass, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>, where people are described as having lost all sensitivity. The cultural context of the time valued honor and shame, making this insensitivity particularly egregious.<p><b>So they will fall among the fallen;</b><br>This predicts inevitable judgment and downfall, aligning with the principle of reaping what one sows, as in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. The imagery of falling suggests defeat and destruction, reminiscent of the fall of Israel to Assyria in <a href="/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>. It underscores the certainty of divine justice.<p><b>when I punish them, they will collapse,</b><br>The phrase indicates God's active role in judgment, consistent with His character as a just judge, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-8.htm">Psalm 9:8</a>. The collapse signifies total ruin, similar to the fate of Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/47.htm">Isaiah 47</a>. This serves as a warning of the consequences of persistent sin.<p><b>says the LORD.</b><br>This affirms the divine authority behind the message, emphasizing its certainty. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) connects to God's covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting their breach of covenant. It reflects the prophetic tradition where God's word is final and unchangeable, as in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

Without repentance, judgment is inevitable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is not arbitrary but is a response to persistent sin and rebellion.

God is not seeking information; He is revealing the depth of their sin (<a href="/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Abomination&#8221; points to idolatry, injustice, and the distortion of worship that had spread from the leaders to the people (<a href="/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>).<p>&#8226; True repentance always begins with godly sorrow (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). The absence of sorrow shows that the people have silenced conscience and prophetic warning alike (<a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a>; <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, they have no shame at all; they do not even know how to blush.</b><p>&#8226; The blunt answer underscores a seared conscience (<a href="/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>).

Yet the principle extends beyond Judah: every nation or individual that rejects God&#8217;s standards faces ultimate accountability (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Collapse here is total&#8212;political, social, spiritual.
