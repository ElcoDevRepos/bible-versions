The context is a dialogue between Jeremiah and the Jewish exiles in Egypt. The women are speaking collectively, indicating a shared belief and practice among them. This reflects the communal nature of religious practices in ancient cultures, where family and community often participated together in worship.<p><b>&#8220;when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her,&#8221;</b><br>The "Queen of Heaven" refers to a pagan deity, likely associated with Ishtar or Astarte, goddesses of fertility and war in Mesopotamian and Canaanite religions. Burning incense and pouring out drink offerings were common practices in ancient Near Eastern worship, signifying devotion and seeking favor from the deity. This practice was condemned by the prophets as idolatry, directly violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The Israelites' adoption of these practices shows the syncretism that had infiltrated their worship, blending Yahweh worship with pagan rituals.<p><b>&#8220;was it without our husbands&#8217; knowledge&#8221;</b><br>This phrase suggests that the women were not acting independently but with the consent or at least the awareness of their husbands. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, religious practices were typically family or community decisions. This implies a collective turning away from God, involving both men and women, which underscores the depth of the apostasy.<p><b>&#8220;that we made sacrificial cakes in her image&#8221;</b><br>Sacrificial cakes were offerings made in the shape or image of the deity being worshiped. This practice is reminiscent of the offerings made to other gods in the region, such as the cakes offered to the goddess Asherah. The making of these cakes was a tangible act of devotion and idolatry, directly opposing the worship of Yahweh, who forbade the making of graven images (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>).<p><b>&#8220;and poured out drink offerings to her?&#8221;</b><br>Drink offerings were libations of wine or other liquids poured out as part of a sacrificial ritual. This act was meant to honor the deity and seek their blessing. In the context of Israelite religion, drink offerings were part of the sacrificial system ordained by God (<a href="/leviticus/23-13.htm">Leviticus 23:13</a>), but here they are misappropriated for idol worship. This highlights the perversion of true worship and the people's rebellion against God's commandments. The repeated mention of drink offerings emphasizes the seriousness of their idolatry and the complete departure from covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women_of_judah.htm">The Women of Judah</a></b><br>These women were involved in idol worship, specifically offering sacrifices to the "queen of heaven," a pagan deity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_queen_of_heaven.htm">The Queen of Heaven</a></b><br>A title used for a pagan goddess, likely associated with fertility and celestial bodies, worshiped by some Israelites in defiance of God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/husbands_of_the_women.htm">Husbands of the Women</a></b><br>The men who were complicit or at least aware of their wives' idolatrous practices, indicating a family-wide departure from worshiping Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's message of judgment against Judah for their idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place where the remnant of Judah had fled, seeking refuge but continuing their idolatrous practices, which Jeremiah condemned.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry's_deceptive_appeal.htm">Idolatry's Deceptive Appeal</a></b><br>Idolatry often promises immediate benefits or security, but it leads to spiritual decay and separation from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_influence_in_spiritual_matters.htm">Family Influence in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>The complicity of husbands highlights the importance of spiritual leadership and accountability within the family unit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_pressures_and_faithfulness.htm">Cultural Pressures and Faithfulness</a></b><br>The Israelites' adoption of local deities in Egypt underscores the challenge of maintaining faithfulness to God amidst cultural pressures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Persistent disobedience to God's commands results in judgment and loss of His protection and blessings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite their rebellion, God's desire for His people is always repentance and restoration, as seen throughout the prophetic messages.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_44_19_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 44:19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_44_19_Idolatry_s_impact_today.htm">How does Jeremiah 44:19 illustrate the consequences of idolatry in our lives today?

The women are adding to Jeremiah&#8217;s ongoing confrontation, not starting a new topic. Their &#8220;moreover&#8221; mirrors how people often pile justification on top of previous arguments (see <a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12-13</a> for that same deflecting pattern). It reminds us that rebellion rarely stops with one excuse; it stacks up layer after layer (<a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said the women</b><p>Women in Egypt&#8217;s Jewish community step forward as spokespeople. This highlights the pervasiveness of idolatry: it had saturated family life so thoroughly that wives confidently voiced it in public (compare <a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a> where Jezebel&#8217;s influence drives Ahab). Scripture shows that spiritual compromise infects whole households when left unchecked (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven</b><p>Incense belongs to worship (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-9</a>), and these women consciously shift that sacred act to a pagan goddess&#8212;probably Ishtar or Astarte. They are admitting direct, intentional competition against the LORD&#8217;s exclusive claims (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). By naming the act, they expose how idolatry counterfeits genuine devotion (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and poured out drink offerings to her</b><p>Drink offerings were designed for the LORD alone (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>). Diverting them to the &#8220;Queen of Heaven&#8221; is theft of what rightfully belongs to God (<a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>). Notice the repetition&#8212;incense, then drink offerings&#8212;showing a full-orbed worship package, not a casual mistake (<a href="/2_kings/17-12.htm">2 Kings 17:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was it without our husbands&#8217; knowledge</b><p>They argue joint complicity. Culturally, husbands bore spiritual responsibility for the household (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>). By invoking their husbands, the women imply, &#8220;We&#8217;re not rogue; the men were in on it.&#8221; It&#8217;s a rationalization: shared guilt feels safer (<a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-4</a>). Yet collective sin never lessens personal accountability (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that we made sacrificial cakes in her image</b><p>These shaped cakes, likely pressed with the goddess&#8217;s emblem, reflect craftsmanship put in service of idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>). The act recalls Israel&#8217;s golden calf, fashioned as a tangible deity (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). It demonstrates how external rituals can harden internal rebellion&#8212;hands busy baking while hearts grow cold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and poured out drink offerings to her?</b><p>The repetition bookends their defense, stressing deliberate, ongoing practice. Their question is rhetorical&#8212;they expect Jeremiah to concede their rituals were transparent and family-approved. Instead, Jeremiah will expose that open, communal sin still provokes God&#8217;s righteous anger (<a href="/jeremiah/44-22.htm">Jeremiah 44:22-23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/44-19.htm">Jeremiah 44:19</a> captures a self-justifying community doubling down on idolatry. By itemizing incense, drink offerings, cakes, and family consensus, the women unwittingly reveal the depth of their rebellion. God&#8217;s exclusive right to worship remains absolute, and shared participation never excuses sin. The verse warns that whenever God&#8217;s ordained worship is replaced, whether by cultural consensus or household tradition, judgment inevitably follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/44.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Without our men.--</span>Better, as in the margin, <span class= "ital">without our husbands. </span>We have here, it is obvious, the very words of the women who were stung by what they looked on as Jeremiah's intimation that the chief guilt lay on them.
