It reflects the divine dilemma of balancing mercy with righteousness. The question underscores the gravity of the people's rebellion and the need for genuine repentance. It echoes similar sentiments found in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/micah/6-3.htm">Micah 6:3</a>, where God calls His people to reason and reflect on their actions.<p><b>Your children have forsaken Me</b><br>The term "children" refers to the people of Israel, emphasizing their covenant relationship with God. Forsaking God indicates a deliberate turning away from the covenant, akin to spiritual adultery. This theme of forsaking God is prevalent throughout the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where the consequences of abandoning God are dire.<p><b>and sworn by gods that are not gods.</b><br>This phrase points to idolatry, a recurring sin in Israel's history. Swearing by false gods signifies allegiance and trust in entities that have no power or existence. This is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and is condemned throughout the prophetic writings, such as in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, which mocks the futility of idol worship.<p><b>I satisfied their needs,</b><br>God's provision for Israel is a recurring theme, reminding them of His faithfulness and care, as seen in the wilderness provision (Exodus 16). Despite God's abundant blessings, the people's ingratitude and rebellion are highlighted. This ingratitude is a common human failing, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, where failure to honor God leads to a darkened heart.<p><b>yet they committed adultery</b><br>Adultery here is both literal and metaphorical, symbolizing unfaithfulness to God. The prophets often use marital imagery to describe Israel's relationship with God, as seen in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>. This unfaithfulness is a breach of the covenant, akin to a spouse breaking marital vows, and is a serious offense in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and assembled at the houses of prostitutes.</b><br>This phrase likely refers to participation in pagan rituals, which often included sexual immorality. Such practices were common in Canaanite religion and were strictly forbidden for the Israelites (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). The imagery of prostitution is used throughout the prophets to describe Israel's spiritual infidelity, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a> and <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>, where the harlot represents false religion and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites, who are being addressed in this passage for their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_gods.htm">False gods</a></b><br>Idols or deities that the Israelites swore by, representing their spiritual adultery and departure from worshiping the one true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/houses_of_prostitutes.htm">Houses of prostitutes</a></b><br>Symbolic of the spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry of the Israelites, often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe infidelity to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one true God, Yahweh, who is expressing His righteous anger and disappointment over the unfaithfulness of His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god.htm">Faithfulness to God</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were called to be faithful to God, we are called to remain true to Him in our daily lives, avoiding modern forms of idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_idolatry.htm">Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>The passage warns of the spiritual and moral decline that results from turning away from God, reminding us of the importance of staying committed to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_our_response.htm">God's Provision and Our Response</a></b><br>Despite God's provision and care, the Israelites turned away.

The latter finds its parallel in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm" title="According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.">Hosea 13:6</a>.

But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading.

The "adultery" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the "harlots' houses" in the next clause.
