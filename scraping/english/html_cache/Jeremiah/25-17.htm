The "cup" symbolizes God's wrath and judgment, a common biblical metaphor (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jeremiah's action of taking the cup indicates his obedience and submission to God's will, reflecting the seriousness of the prophetic message. The imagery of the cup is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the cup of suffering He must drink (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>), drawing a parallel between Jeremiah's mission and Christ's redemptive work.<p><b>and made all the nations drink from it,</b><br>The act of making the nations drink from the cup represents the execution of divine judgment. This is not a literal drinking but a symbolic act of experiencing God's wrath. The nations mentioned later in the chapter (<a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18-26</a>) were historical entities that faced judgment due to their sins and rebellion against God. This reflects the universal scope of God's sovereignty and justice, emphasizing that no nation is exempt from accountability. The concept of nations drinking from the cup is echoed in <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>, where those who oppose God face His wrath.<p><b>each one to whom the LORD had sent me,</b><br>This phrase underscores Jeremiah's divine commission and the specificity of his prophetic mission. God directed Jeremiah to particular nations, highlighting the intentionality of divine judgment. It also reflects the broader theme of prophetic responsibility, where prophets are sent to deliver God's message regardless of the audience's response. This mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus sends His disciples to all nations, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan for salvation and judgment throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah and the surrounding nations.

Receiving the cup from the LORD&#8217;s hand, Jeremiah demonstrates willing obedience. Passing it on to every assigned nation affirms that no people are exempt from divine accountability. The verse therefore stands as both a historical marker of fulfilled judgment and a timeless warning: God&#8217;s holiness demands a response, and His Word&#8212;accurate in every detail&#8212;will come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Then took I the cup . . .</span>--The words describe the act of the prophet as in the ecstasy of vision. One by one the nations are made to drink of that cup of the wrath of Jehovah of which His own country was to have the first and fullest draught. It is a strange example of the literalism of minds incapable of entering into the poetry of a prophet's work, that one commentator (Michaelis) has supposed that the prophet offered an actual goblet of wine to the ambassadors of the states named, who were then, as he imagines, assembled at Jerusalem, as in <a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm" title="And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah;">Jeremiah 27:3</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then took I the cup... and made all the nations to drink</span>. It is too pro-sale to suppose either that Jeremiah made a journey to "all the nations," or that he actually went through the form of presenting the cup to the ambassadors who (it is conjectured, comp. <a href="/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>b) had come to Jerusalem to take measures against the common foe (so J. D. Michaelis). But the supposition arises (as Keil has well observed) out of an imperfect comprehension of the figure. It is not a cup with wine which the prophet receives from Jehovah, but a wine-cup filled with the wine of God's fury, which wine (one may add) is no more a literal wine than the "sword of Jehovah" is a literal sword. The "making all the nations to drink" is simply a way of expressing the prophet's firm faith that the word of Jehovah will not "return unto him void " - that a prophecy once uttered must fulfill itself; and "sent me," in the last clause, merely means "entrusted me with a message" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>). For the fulfillment of this detailed prediction, see on Jeremiah 46-51. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
