The call to women here emphasizes the communal nature of lamentation and the importance of passing down traditions of mourning. This phrase underscores the urgency and seriousness of the message from God, as women are often seen as the keepers of cultural and familial continuity. The "word of the LORD" signifies a divine message that demands attention and action, reflecting the prophetic tradition where God communicates directly with His people.<p><b>Open your ears to the word of His mouth.</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of active listening and obedience to God's commands. In biblical times, hearing was closely associated with obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, where the Shema calls Israel to hear and love God. The emphasis on "the word of His mouth" suggests a direct and personal communication from God, reinforcing the authority and truth of the prophetic message. It calls for a readiness to receive and respond to divine instruction, a theme prevalent throughout the prophetic books.<p><b>Teach your daughters to wail,</b><br>The instruction to teach daughters to wail indicates the perpetuation of mourning practices across generations. In the ancient Near East, professional mourners were often employed to express grief publicly, and this cultural practice is reflected here. The act of wailing is a physical manifestation of sorrow and repentance, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature as a response to sin and impending judgment. This teaching also implies a communal responsibility to prepare the next generation for the realities of life and the consequences of disobedience to God.<p><b>and one another to lament.</b><br>Lamentation is a profound expression of grief and sorrow, often associated with repentance and seeking God's mercy. The communal aspect of lamenting together suggests solidarity and shared responsibility among the people. This practice is seen throughout the Psalms and Lamentations, where collective mourning is a response to national calamity or divine judgment. The call to lament is not only an acknowledgment of current suffering but also a plea for divine intervention and restoration, pointing to the hope of redemption and reconciliation with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

The words rest upon the idea that wailing was an art, its cries and tones skilfully adapted to the special sorrows of which it was in theory the expression. They perhaps imply also that death would do its work so terribly that the demand for mourners would be greater than the supply, and that supernumeraries must be trained to meet it.
