The "stubbornness of their hearts" refers to the willful disobedience and pride that leads people away from God's commandments. Biblically, the heart is often seen as the center of will and emotion (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). This stubbornness is a rejection of divine wisdom, contrasting with the call to have a heart of flesh, sensitive to God's guidance (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). The Israelites' persistent rebellion is a pattern seen throughout their history, as in the wilderness wanderings (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>).<p><b>and gone after the Baals</b><br>The Baals were Canaanite deities associated with fertility and weather, often worshiped through rituals that included idolatry and immorality. This phrase indicates a turning away from the worship of Yahweh to engage in pagan practices. The worship of Baal was a significant issue during the time of the Judges and the monarchy (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>, <a href="/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>). This idolatry was not just a religious failure but also a cultural assimilation that led to moral and social decay. The prophets frequently condemned this practice, emphasizing the exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>).<p><b>as their fathers taught them.</b><br>This phrase underscores the generational nature of sin and disobedience. The Israelites' ancestors had also fallen into idolatry, setting a precedent for future generations (<a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>). This reflects the biblical principle that the sins of the fathers can influence their descendants (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). However, it also highlights the responsibility of each generation to choose obedience to God, as seen in the call to break from the past and follow God's ways (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>).
