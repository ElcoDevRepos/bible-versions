This reflects a spiritual apathy and neglect of their primary role. In the context of Israel's history, the priesthood was established to mediate between God and the people (Exodus 28-29). Their failure to inquire of the Lord indicates a breakdown in their relationship with Him, reminiscent of the period of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>The experts in the law no longer knew Me,</b><br>The experts in the law, or scribes, were tasked with studying, interpreting, and teaching the Law of Moses. Their ignorance of God suggests a departure from true understanding and application of the Scriptures. This parallels the criticism Jesus later directs at the Pharisees and scribes for their legalism and lack of genuine knowledge of God (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23-28</a>). It highlights the danger of knowing the letter of the law without knowing the God who gave it.<p><b>and the leaders rebelled against Me.</b><br>The leaders, likely referring to the political and social leaders of Judah, actively opposed God's authority. This rebellion is a recurring theme in Israel's history, where kings and leaders often led the people into idolatry and away from God's commandments (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). Their rebellion is a direct violation of the covenant relationship established at Sinai, where God was to be their ultimate King (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p><b>The prophets prophesied by Baal</b><br>Baal was a Canaanite deity often associated with fertility and storms. The prophets' allegiance to Baal instead of Yahweh represents a profound spiritual adultery. This is reminiscent of the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), where the powerlessness of Baal is exposed. The prophets' actions are a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and followed useless idols.</b><br>The term "useless idols" underscores the futility and emptiness of idol worship. Idols, made by human hands, have no power or life (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). This phrase echoes the prophetic critique found throughout the Old Testament, where idols are contrasted with the living God (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). The pursuit of idols leads to spiritual bankruptcy and is a betrayal of the covenant relationship with God, who alone is worthy of worship and trust.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders responsible for temple worship and teaching the law.

Faithful believers are urged to keep asking, &#8220;Where is the LORD?&#8221; stay relationally acquainted with Him, submit to His rule, and reject every substitute that cannot save (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4&#8211;8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">The priests said not . . .</span>--As throughout the work of Jeremiah and most of the prophets of the Old Testament, that which weighed most heavily on their souls was that those who were called to be guides of the people were themselves the chief agents in the evil. The salt had lost its savour. The light had become darkness. The rebuke, we must remember, came from the lips of one who was himself a priest.<p><span class= "bld">The priests said not, Where is the Lord?</span>--The same failure to seek as that condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/2-6.htm" title="Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelled?">Jeremiah 2:6</a>.

The Hebrew word was general in its significance, but in its Old Testament use was applied chiefly to civil rulers, as in <a href="/psalms/78-71.htm" title="From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-17.htm" title="And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.">1Kings 22:17</a>. Even in Ezekiel 34, where the spiritual aspect of rule is most prominent, the contrast between the false shepherds and the one true shepherd of the house of David (<a href="/jeremiah/2-23.htm" title="How can you say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see your way in the valley, know what you have done: you are a swift dromedary traversing her ways;">Jeremiah 2:23</a>) shows that the kingly, not the priestly, office was in the prophet's mind. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priests</span>, etc. The blame principally falls on the three leading classes (as in ver. 26; <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). First on the priests who "handle the <span class="accented">Law</span>," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who have a traditional knowledge of the details of the Law, and teach the people accordingly (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9-11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; see also on Jeremiah 8:8); next on the "pastors," or "shepherds" (in the Homeric sense), the civil and not the spiritual authorities; so generally in the Old Testament (see <a href="/jeremiah/3-15.htm">Jeremiah 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Jeremiah 10:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-22.htm">Jeremiah 22:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>; <a href="/zechariah/10-3.htm">Zechariah 10:3</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5, 8, 16</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); and lastly on the prophets, who sought their inspiration, not from Jehovah (comp. note on ver. 30), but from Baal. <span class="cmt_word">To prophesy by</span> (by means of) <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span> or rather, <span class="accented">the Baal</span>, implies that prophecy is due to an impulse from the supernatural world; that it is not an objectifying of the imaginations of the prophet himself. Even the Baal prophets yielded to an impulse from without, but how that impulse was produced the prophet does not tell us. We are told in <a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, that even prophets of Jehovah could be led astray by a "lying spirit;" much more presumably could prophets of the Baal. <span class="accented">The Baal is</span> here used as a representative of the idol-gods, in antithesis to Jehovah; sometimes "Baalim," or the Baals, is used instead (e.g. ver. 23; <a href="/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a>), each town or city having its own Baal ("lord"). <span class="cmt_word">Things that do not profit</span>. A synonym for idols (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/16-19.htm">Jeremiah 16:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9</a>;. <a href="/1_samuel/12-21.htm">1 Samuel 12:21</a>).
