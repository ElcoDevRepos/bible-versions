In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the sun, moon, and stars were often deified and worshiped. This idolatry was explicitly condemned in the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). The exposure of the bones to these celestial bodies signifies a reversal of their worship, as they are now powerless and dishonored before the very objects they revered.<p><b>which they have loved, served, followed, consulted, and worshiped</b><br>This list of actions underscores the depth of Judah's apostasy. Each verb indicates a progression of idolatry: "loved" suggests affection, "served" implies acts of devotion, "followed" indicates allegiance, "consulted" suggests seeking guidance, and "worshiped" denotes reverence. This mirrors the first commandment's prohibition against idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>). The comprehensive nature of these actions shows how deeply ingrained idolatry had become in their society.<p><b>Their bones will not be gathered up or buried</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, proper burial was a sign of honor and respect, while exposure of bones was a disgrace (<a href="/1_kings/13-22.htm">1 Kings 13:22</a>). The lack of burial signifies divine judgment and ultimate shame. This imagery is a stark contrast to the hope of resurrection and eternal life, which is a theme found throughout Scripture (<a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>).<p><b>but will become like dung lying on the ground</b><br>This simile emphasizes the utter contempt and worthlessness of the unburied bones. Dung, considered unclean and repulsive, symbolizes the defilement and judgment upon those who forsake God. This imagery is reminiscent of the curses for disobedience outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-26.htm">Deuteronomy 28:26</a>, where the carcasses of the disobedient would be food for birds and beasts, indicating total disgrace and abandonment by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

The passage declares that idolatry ends in utter shame, while affirming God&#8217;s justice and His sole right to worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Whom they have loved . . .</span>--Here, again, there is a peculiar characteristic emphasis in the piling up, one upon another, of verbs more or less synonymous. So far as there is a traceable order, it is from the first inward impulse prompting to idolatry to the full development of that feeling in ritual. The sun, moon, and stars shall look, not on crowds of adoring worshippers, but on the carcases of those whose love and worship, transferred from Jehovah to the host of heaven, have brought on them that terrible doom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall spread them</span>, etc. Not as an act of solemn mockery, for the agents are idolaters themselves, but God so overrules the passions of his unconscious instruments that no more effective ceremonial could have been devised. <span class="cmt_word">Whom</span> <span class="cmt_word">they have loved</span>, etc. The prophet is designedly diffuse in his description. With all their misspent zeal, these unhappy idolaters cannot even find tombs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/8-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will be exposed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1496;&#1464;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
