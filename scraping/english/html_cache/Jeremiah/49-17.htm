This prophecy against Edom reflects the judgment of God due to their pride and hostility towards Israel (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4</a>). Historically, Edom was located south of the Dead Sea, in present-day Jordan. The prophecy indicates a complete desolation, aligning with other biblical prophecies (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-15</a>). The term "object of horror" suggests a transformation from a once-thriving nation to a desolate wasteland, serving as a warning to other nations about the consequences of opposing God's people.<p><b>All who pass by will be appalled</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of Edom's destruction. Travelers witnessing the devastation would be shocked and dismayed. This reaction is similar to the response to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-28</a>), where the sight of the ruins served as a testament to divine judgment. The appalling sight would serve as a visual reminder of God's power and justice, reinforcing the seriousness of Edom's sins.<p><b>and will scoff at all her wounds.</b><br>The scoffing indicates a sense of derision and mockery from onlookers. Edom's wounds symbolize the consequences of their actions and the fulfillment of divine retribution. This mirrors the fate of other nations that opposed Israel, such as Babylon (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>). The wounds also suggest a complete and irreversible downfall, highlighting the futility of opposing God's will. The imagery of wounds can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore wounds for humanity's sins, contrasting Edom's deserved punishment with Christ's redemptive suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

This is not exaggeration; it is a literal verdict, already echoed in <a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a> and later affirmed in <a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-4</a>.<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s judgment is comprehensive: cities, fortresses, and people. <a href="/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3-4</a> describes the same desolation, promising that Edom&#8217;s proud heights will become a wasteland.<p>&#8226; The moral reason is clear. Edom repeatedly chose violence against Israel (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>-14). By setting itself against God&#8217;s covenant people, Edom placed itself under the covenant curses of <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will curse those who curse you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When Scripture says &#8220;object of horror,&#8221; it signals a real-world ruin so stark that travelers physically recoil (compare <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>). God shows His holiness by making sin&#8217;s consequences visible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All who pass by will be appalled</b><p>&#8226; The prophecy widens the circle: every passerby&#8212;trader, pilgrim, foreign king&#8212;will be stunned. <a href="/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22-24</a> uses identical language for the barren plains of Sodom, making Edom&#8217;s fate a living proverb.<p>&#8226; Appalled onlookers highlight God&#8217;s universal witness. <a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a> says of Judah&#8217;s judgment, &#8220;All who pass by it will be horrified.&#8221; Judgment turns geography into a sermon, reminding nations that the Lord alone rules history (<a href="/psalms/46-8.htm">Psalm 46:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse implicitly invites us to consider our own response. Are we merely shocked spectators, or do we let God&#8217;s warnings stir repentance as <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9-10</a> urges when Babylon falls?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and will scoff at all her wounds</b><p>&#8226; The term &#8220;scoff&#8221; shows an added layer of humiliation. Not only is Edom destroyed, she is mocked. <a href="/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15-16</a> records similar taunts against fallen Jerusalem. Divine justice may permit enemies to jeer so the conquered nation feels the full weight of her pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wounds&#8221; are both physical ruins and moral injuries. <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 12</a> forbids gloating over a brother&#8217;s calamity, yet Edom once laughed at Judah&#8217;s downfall. God now turns the tables: the mocker is mocked (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-13</a> shows Edom&#8217;s gleeful vengeance against Israel; now that same ridicule rebounds on her. The principle is simple: the measure you use will be measured back to you (<a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17</a> delivers a sober, literal forecast: Edom&#8217;s pride and hostility toward God&#8217;s people will end in horrifying desolation, worldwide astonishment, and humiliating mockery. The scene affirms God&#8217;s unwavering justice, the certainty of His covenant promises, and the inevitable downfall of any nation or person that opposes His purposes. The passage stands as a billboard on history&#8217;s highway, warning every passerby that the Lord&#8217;s word never fails and urging us to choose humility and obedience while grace is still offered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Edom shall be a desolation.</span>--The words did not receive an immediate or even a rapid fulfilment. Idumaea was a populous and powerful country in the time of John Hyrcanus. Petra, as we have seen, was rebuilt by the Romans as a centre of trade and government, and had its baths, and theatres, and temples. But the end came at last, and there are few lands, once the seat of a thriving nation, more utterly desolate than that of Edom. From the ninth century of the Christian era it disappears from history (Robinson's <span class= "ital">Researches, ii.</span> 575).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A desolation;</span> rather, <span class="accented">an astonishment.</span> The word is from the same root as the following verb.
