This phrase highlights the severity of using God's name to legitimize falsehoods. Biblically, this is a violation of the commandment against taking the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed great importance on the authority of prophets, making false prophecy particularly dangerous.<p><b>replied the LORD.</b><br>This indicates that the message comes directly from God, emphasizing its authority and truth. Throughout the Old Testament, God often communicated through prophets like Jeremiah to correct and guide His people. The use of "replied" suggests a response to a situation or question, underscoring the ongoing dialogue between God and His people.<p><b>I did not send them or appoint them or speak to them.</b><br>God clarifies that these prophets have no divine mandate. In biblical history, true prophets were chosen and sent by God, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8-9</a>). This phrase underscores the importance of divine commissioning in authentic prophecy.<p><b>They are prophesying to you a false vision,</b><br>The false prophets were presenting visions that did not originate from God. In the Bible, visions are often used to convey divine messages, such as those given to Daniel (Daniel 7) and Ezekiel (Ezekiel 1). The term "false vision" indicates a counterfeit revelation, misleading the people away from God's truth.<p><b>a worthless divination,</b><br>Divination refers to seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means. In <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>, divination is condemned as detestable to God. The use of "worthless" suggests that these practices are not only ineffective but also devoid of any true spiritual value.<p><b>the futility and delusion of their own minds.</b><br>This phrase highlights the human origin of the false prophecies, contrasting them with divine revelation. The futility and delusion indicate that these messages are based on human imagination and deception rather than God's truth.

They are filling you with false hopes&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>).<p>&#8226; False prophets often invoke God&#8217;s name to gain credibility (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). The misuse of the divine name is not a minor mistake; it is taking the Lord&#8217;s name in vain on a national scale (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; For us, any teaching that contradicts clear Scripture&#8212;even if labeled &#8220;Christian&#8221;&#8212;must be rejected (<a href="/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The statement comes directly from Yahweh, underscoring divine authority. God&#8217;s personal response mirrors other moments when He speaks into confusion, such as His reply to Job (<a href="/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly shows God confronting error rather than ignoring it (<a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>).
