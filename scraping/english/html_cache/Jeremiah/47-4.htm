The Philistines occupied the coastal region of Canaan and were often in conflict with Israel, as seen in the stories of Samson and David. The "day" refers to a divinely appointed time of reckoning, a common theme in prophetic literature where God enacts justice against nations. This judgment fulfills earlier prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29-31</a> and <a href="/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a>, where the Philistines' downfall is foretold.<p><b>to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every remaining ally</b><br>Tyre and Sidon were prominent Phoenician cities known for their trade and wealth. They often had alliances with neighboring nations, including the Philistines. The cutting off of allies signifies a complete isolation and vulnerability of the Philistines, emphasizing the totality of their destruction. This also reflects the broader theme of God's sovereignty over nations, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/28.htm">Ezekiel 28</a>, where Tyre's judgment is pronounced.<p><b>Indeed, the LORD is about to destroy the Philistines</b><br>The use of "the LORD" underscores the divine authority behind the impending destruction. It is not merely a geopolitical event but an act of divine judgment. The Philistines' destruction is part of God's plan to purify the land and establish His justice, as seen in the broader narrative of the Old Testament where God judges nations for their sins and idolatry.<p><b>the remnant from the coasts of Caphtor</b><br>Caphtor is traditionally identified with Crete, suggesting the Philistines' origins. This reference to the "remnant" indicates that even the survivors or those who might have escaped previous judgments will not be spared. The mention of Caphtor ties back to <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a> and <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>, where the Philistines' origins and migrations are noted, highlighting God's control over the movements and destinies of peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>An ancient people who were often in conflict with Israel.

Both, as occupying the sea-board of Palestine, were to suffer from Nebuchadnezzar's invasion. <a href="/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a> indicates that they were not unfrequently in alliance. In the "helper that remaineth" we have probably a reference to the foreign mercenaries, especially the Philistines, employed by the two great commercial cities. "Caphtor" has been identified with Crete, Cyprus, Caria, Cappadocia, and the delta of the Nile. On the latter view the name is held to be connected with <span class= "ital">Coptic. </span><a href="/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a> points to a migration of the people known as Philistines from that region, and there is accordingly a touch of scorn in the way in which Jeremiah speaks of them as the mere "remnant of Caphtor." In agreement with the first view we find among David's mercenaries the Cherethim and Pelethim (<a href="/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2Samuel 8:18</a>), the two names being probably modifications of Cretans and Philistines. The ethnological table of <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm" title="And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.">Genesis 10:14</a> connects both the Philistines and the Caphtorim with Mizraim or Egypt, and is, so far as it goes, in favour of the Egyptian identification.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The day that cometh;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the day that hath come</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall have come). It is "the day of the Lord" that is meant, that revolutionary "shaking of all things" (to use Haggai's expression, <a href="/haggai/2-21.htm">Haggai 2:21</a>), as to which see further in note on Jeremiah 46:10. <span class="cmt_word">To cut off... every helper that remaineth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every ally on whom they could still reckon. This passage favours the view that the judgment upon the Philistines took place at the same time as that upon Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar's object was to isolate Tyre and Sidon as completely as possible. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> The Philistines had suffered so much from repeated invasions as to be only a "remnant" of the once powerful nation which oppressed Israel (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">The country of Caphtor.</span> Some would render "the coastland of Caphtor," but the idea of "coast" seems to be a secondary one, derived in certain passages from the context. Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for "land," and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. "Caphtor" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun -
