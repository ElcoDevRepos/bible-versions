The "house of the king of Judah" refers to the Davidic dynasty, which held significant importance in biblical history as the line through which the Messiah was prophesied to come (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This context underscores the gravity of the message, as it addresses the leadership responsible for guiding the nation according to God's covenant.<p><b>You are like Gilead to Me,</b><br>Gilead was a region east of the Jordan River known for its balm, a valuable healing ointment (<a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>). By comparing the house of the king to Gilead, God is highlighting its preciousness and potential for healing and blessing. This metaphor suggests that the royal house was once esteemed and held a place of favor in God's eyes, much like the fertile and resource-rich land of Gilead.<p><b>like the summit of Lebanon;</b><br>Lebanon was renowned for its majestic cedar trees, which were highly prized for construction, including the building of Solomon's Temple (<a href="/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). The "summit of Lebanon" evokes images of grandeur and beauty. This comparison indicates the high status and splendor that the house of Judah once possessed. It also alludes to the potential for greatness and the divine favor that was available to them.<p><b>but I will surely turn you into a desert,</b><br>The transformation from a lush, fertile region to a desert signifies judgment and desolation. This stark contrast serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience and unfaithfulness to God's covenant. The imagery of a desert, a place of barrenness and lifelessness, underscores the severity of the impending judgment that would strip away the prosperity and glory once enjoyed by the royal house.<p><b>like cities that are uninhabited.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the desolation that will come upon the house of the king of Judah. Uninhabited cities suggest complete abandonment and ruin, a fate that befell many cities in the ancient Near East as a result of conquest or divine judgment. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic warnings throughout Jeremiah, where the consequences of turning away from God lead to devastation and exile (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). The desolation serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who speaks through the prophet Jeremiah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_king_of_judah.htm">The House of the King of Judah</a></b><br>Refers to the royal lineage and the ruling authority in Judah, specifically during the time of Jeremiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land, symbolizing beauty and prosperity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>Known for its majestic cedar trees, representing strength and grandeur.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of judgment and hope to Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's message through Jeremiah highlights the severe consequences of turning away from His commandments.

Even in his utterance of woes the prophet's mind is still that of a poet. The chief point of the comparison in both cases is to be found in the forests that crowned the heights of both ranges of mountains. The "oaks of Bashan," in the Gilead district (<a href="/isaiah/2-13.htm" title="And on all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and on all the oaks of Bashan,">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="/zechariah/11-2.htm" title="Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O you oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.">Zechariah 11:2</a>), were as famous as the cedars of Lebanon, and both were alike the fit symbol of the glory of sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm" title="By your servants have you reproached the Lord, and have said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-3.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, long winged, full of feathers, which had divers colors, came to Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:">Ezekiel 17:3</a>). There may be a reference to the group of cedar-buildings, which of old gave to one of the palaces the name of "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm" title="That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.">2Samuel 7:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/7-7.htm" title="In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build you not me an house of cedar?">2Samuel 7:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm" title="He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.">1Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-21.htm" title="And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.">1Kings 10:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the king's house of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">concerning the house of the King of Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the royal palace, which, on account of its height and its being constructed so largely out of cedar-weed (comp. vers. 14, 23), is called "Gilead, and the summit of Lebanon," just as Solomon's palace was called "the house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). Of Gilead in general, Canon Tristram writes, "No one can fairly judge of Israel's heritage who has not seen the luxuriant exuberance of Gilead, as well as the bard rocks of Judaea." And again, "Lovely knolls and dells open out at every turn, gently rising to the wooded plateau above. Then we rise to higher ground and ride through noble forests of oak. Then for a mile or two through luxuriant green corn, or perhaps through a rich forest of scattered olive trees, left untended and uncared for, with perhaps patches of corn in the open glades" ('Bible Places,' p. 322). The cedars of Lebanon, however diminished, still bear witness to the ancient fame of this splendid mountain district. <span class="cmt_word">A wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited</span>. The comparison has a terrible significance when read in the light of De Vogue's and Freshfield's discoveries. For Gilead itself is full of ruined cities of massive stone architecture. "It is no uncommon thing," says Mr. F.A. Eaton, "to see these houses in a complete state of preservation, built of huge blocks of black basalt, with slabs of the same for the roof, twelve feet long, a foot and a half wide, and half a foot thick, and entrance doors also of basalt... great solid stones of the same material being used as lintels at the top and bottom" (Speech at the meeting for setting on foot the survey of Eastern Palestine, November 30, 1880: <span class="accented">Statement of Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, January, 1880, p. 11). <span class="accented">Cities which are not inhabited</span>; not, indeed, the cities of Gilead of the time of Jeremiah, but constructed of materials which may reasonably be presumed to have been chiseled in a far more remote antiquity. (The date of the cities in their present state is subsequent to the Christian era.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;
