This phrase introduces a divine oracle against them, indicating God's direct communication and judgment. The Ammonites' territory was east of the Jordan River, and they frequently opposed Israel (<a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4-33</a>). This sets the stage for a prophetic message, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>Has Israel no sons?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies that Israel should have rightful heirs to their land. It suggests a challenge to the Ammonites' encroachment on Israelite territory. The question underscores the covenantal promise to Israel of land and descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), highlighting the expectation of Israel's continued presence and inheritance.<p><b>Is he without heir?</b><br>This reinforces the previous question, emphasizing the absurdity of Israel lacking an heir. It points to the historical context where Israel, despite exile and dispersion, retains a divine promise of restoration and continuity (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>). The heirship is both physical and spiritual, foreshadowing the ultimate heir, Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promises to Israel.<p><b>Why then has Milcom taken possession of Gad?</b><br>Milcom, also known as Molech, was the chief deity of the Ammonites, associated with child sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). The mention of Gad, a tribe of Israel, indicates territorial loss to the Ammonites. This reflects historical incursions where Ammon took advantage of Israel's weakness, particularly during times of exile or internal strife (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>).<p><b>Why have his people settled in their cities?</b><br>This question highlights the Ammonites' occupation of Israelite cities, suggesting a reversal of fortunes. It reflects the historical reality of shifting control in the region due to military conquests and political alliances. Theologically, it points to the consequences of Israel's disobedience but also anticipates divine justice and restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a>).

On the deportation of the Trans-jordanic tribes by Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm" title="In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.">2Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-6.htm" title="Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.">1Chronicles 5:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>), they made a more successful effort, and their king Baalis appears as prompting the conspiracy of Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah (<a href="/jeremiah/40-14.htm" title="And said to him, Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay you? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.">Jeremiah 40:14</a>). The prophecy on which we now enter was probably delivered before that time, in or about the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/25-21.htm" title="Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon,">Jeremiah 25:21</a>). Its opening words recall the long-standing territorial controversy. "Had Israel no heir?" Was the land he had occupied so long to pass into the possession of a stranger? . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/49.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - The violence of the Ammonites shall be severely punished. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath Israel no sons!</span> The violent seizure, perpetrated before his eyes, of parts of the sacred territory, forces the indignant question from the prophet, "How can these things be?" It was so on a former occasion (see <a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), and it is so again, now that the Ammonites are occupying the land of the Gadites. True, the present generation has lost its property, but the next is the heir to all its rights and privileges. <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">their King</span> - their Melech or Moloch; it is the heavenly, not the earthly king who is referred to (so in <a href="/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, however, read <span class="accented">Milcom</span>, which was the name of the Ammonite deity; this is only a different vocalizing of the consonants of the text. The actual vowel points give "malcam." This reading may, of course, be interpreted of the <span class="accented">earthly</span> king of the Ammonites.
