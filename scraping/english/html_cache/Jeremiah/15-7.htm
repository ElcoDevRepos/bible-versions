In biblical times, this was a common practice, symbolizing judgment and separation. The "gates of the land" likely refer to the entry points of Judah, indicating a comprehensive judgment affecting the entire nation. This scattering is a metaphor for the dispersion of the people due to their disobedience, reminiscent of the scattering of Israel in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The winnowing fork is a tool of separation, symbolizing God's discernment and judgment, similar to the separation of wheat and chaff in <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>.<p><b>I will bereave and destroy My people who have not turned from their ways.</b><br>The term "bereave" suggests a loss of children, indicating severe punishment and sorrow. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>, where disobedience leads to loss and devastation. The phrase "My people" underscores the relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the gravity of their rebellion. Despite being His chosen people, their persistent sinfulness leads to destruction, as seen in the repeated calls for repentance throughout Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>). The failure to turn from their ways emphasizes the theme of repentance, a central message in prophetic literature, and foreshadows the ultimate call to repentance through Christ (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah.

God, wielding the winnowing fork, sifts a resistant nation right at its gates, stripping away security, relationships, and resources, because the people stubbornly refuse to turn back. The passage reminds us that the Lord&#8217;s discipline flows from His holiness and His covenant love&#8212;He separates, grieves, and even destroys, not out of spite, but to purge sin and invite genuine repentance before it is forever too late.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">I will fan them with a fan.</span>--The image is, of course, the familiar one of the threshing-floor and the winnowing-fan or shovel (<a href="/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.">Matthew 3:12</a>).
