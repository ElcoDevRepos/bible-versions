A cubit is generally considered to be about 18 inches, making each pillar approximately 27 feet tall. This height signifies strength and stability, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel. The pillars, named Jachin and Boaz, stood at the entrance of the Temple, representing God's establishment and strength (<a href="/1_kings/7-21.htm">1 Kings 7:21</a>). Their height also reflects the majesty and glory of God, as the Temple was a place where His presence dwelled among His people.<p><b>and twelve cubits in circumference;</b><br>The circumference of twelve cubits, or about 18 feet, suggests a substantial and robust structure. The number twelve often represents completeness or the people of God in biblical numerology, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles. This measurement could symbolize the completeness of God's people and His covenant with them. The pillars' size and dimensions emphasize the Temple's role as a central place of worship and a symbol of God's relationship with Israel.<p><b>each was hollow,</b><br>The fact that the pillars were hollow indicates a practical approach to construction, allowing for a lighter structure that was easier to transport and erect. This detail also highlights the craftsmanship and engineering skills of the period. Spiritually, the hollowness could symbolize the need for God's presence to fill the Temple, just as believers are called to be filled with the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). The hollowness may also suggest that outward appearances can be deceiving, and true strength comes from within, a theme echoed in various biblical teachings.<p><b>four fingers thick.</b><br>The thickness of four fingers, approximately three inches, suggests a balance between strength and practicality. This detail underscores the durability and resilience of the pillars, designed to withstand the test of time. In a spiritual sense, the thickness could represent the protection and security provided by God to His people. The number four often symbolizes universality or completeness in creation, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four living creatures in Revelation. This measurement may imply the comprehensive nature of God's protection and presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire responsible for the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, as well as the exile of the Jewish people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon's_temple.htm">Solomon's Temple</a></b><br>The first temple in Jerusalem, built by King Solomon, which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bronze_pillars.htm">Bronze Pillars</a></b><br>Part of the temple's structure, these pillars were significant in the temple's design and symbolized strength and stability.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who conquered Jerusalem and ordered the destruction of the temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_strength_and_stability.htm">Symbolism of Strength and Stability</a></b><br>The bronze pillars represented the strength and stability of God's presence among His people.

They had names&#8212;Jachin (&#8220;He establishes&#8221;) and Boaz (&#8220;In Him is strength&#8221;)&#8212;and stood at the entrance to the temple, a daily visual of God&#8217;s stability and power for every worshiper who entered. In <a href="/bsb/jeremiah/52.htm">Jeremiah 52</a> they are being cataloged as the Babylonians dismantle and carry them off (<a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>), proving that no earthly structure, however sacred, is immune to judgment when the people reject the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eighteen cubits tall</b><p>&#8220;Eighteen cubits&#8221; comes out to about twenty-seven feet.

An empty shell of religion collapses when tested (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God delights to fill vessels that recognize their emptiness (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).
