The imagery of "eating" the words suggests internalization and acceptance, akin to the consumption of food for nourishment. In the ancient Near Eastern context, eating often symbolized taking something into one's life and being. This metaphor is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/3.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>, where Ezekiel is instructed to eat a scroll, symbolizing the acceptance and proclamation of God's message. The discovery of God's words may refer to the rediscovery of the Book of the Law during King Josiah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>), which profoundly impacted Judah and its prophets. This phrase emphasizes the transformative power of God's word, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-103.htm">Psalm 119:103</a>, where God's words are described as sweeter than honey.<p><b>Your words became my joy and my heart&#8217;s delight.</b><br>Jeremiah's response to God's words is one of joy and delight, indicating a profound spiritual satisfaction and fulfillment. Despite the challenging messages he had to deliver, Jeremiah found personal joy in his relationship with God. This joy is not dependent on external circumstances but is rooted in the divine truth and presence. The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of emotion and will, suggesting that God's words deeply affected Jeremiah's entire being. This joy parallels the New Testament teaching in <a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>, where Jesus speaks of His joy being in believers, making their joy complete. The delight in God's word is also echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous person meditates on God's law day and night.<p><b>For I bear Your name, O LORD God of Hosts.</b><br>Bearing God's name signifies a close, covenantal relationship with Him. In the ancient world, names were deeply significant, often reflecting character and destiny. Jeremiah's identity and mission are tied to the name of the LORD, the covenant name of God revealed to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>). The title "God of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power, often associated with His role as the commander of heavenly armies. This title reassures Jeremiah of God's ultimate authority and support, even amidst opposition. Bearing God's name also implies representation and responsibility, as seen in the New Testament where believers are called to bear the name of Christ (<a href="/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>). This phrase highlights the prophet's role as God's spokesperson and the honor and burden that come with it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His messages to the people of Judah.

Scripture is not a human creation but a treasure waiting to be uncovered (<a href="/psalms/119-162.htm">Psalm 119:162</a>: &#8220;I rejoice in Your promise like one who finds great spoil,&#8221;). When we open the Bible, we, too, &#8220;find&#8221; the very words of God&#8212;truth revealed, not imagined.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I ate them</b><p>Jeremiah doesn&#8217;t merely survey God&#8217;s words; he ingests them, echoing Ezekiel&#8217;s call to &#8220;eat this scroll&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; To &#8220;eat&#8221; speaks of personal appropriation&#8212;Scripture internalized until it nourishes the soul (<a href="/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a>, &#8220;I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; It also implies exclusivity: no substitute diet satisfies (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p>The prophet models a habit of wholehearted consumption rather than occasional sampling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your words became my joy and my heart&#8217;s delight</b><p>Once ingested, the word produces gladness. <a href="/psalms/119-111.htm">Psalm 119:111</a> says, &#8220;Your testimonies are my heritage forever, for they are the joy of my heart,&#8221;. Joy here is not circumstantial; Jeremiah ministers in dark days, yet Scripture anchors his emotions. Jesus later promises, &#8220;These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>). When God&#8217;s word moves from page to heart, delight replaces despair.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I bear Your name, O LORD God of Hosts</b><p>Jeremiah&#8217;s identity explains his response. Bearing God&#8217;s name signifies representation and ownership (<a href="/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). The &#8220;LORD God of Hosts&#8221; title stresses divine authority over every army, earthly or heavenly. Because Jeremiah belongs to this Commander, he cannot treat the Word casually (<a href="/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). Loyalty to the Name compels loyalty to the Word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a> shows the progression every believer should experience: discover God&#8217;s Word, internalize it, enjoy its transforming power, and live it out as a marked representative of the LORD of Hosts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Thy words were found . . .</span>--The words <span class= "ital">go </span>back to the mission of Jeremiah 1, and paint, with a wonderful power, the beginning of a prophet's work, the new-born intensity of joy in the sense of communion with the Eternal. The soul feeds on the words that come to it (see the same figure in a bolder form in <a href="/ezekiel/2-8.htm" title="But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.">Ezekiel 2:8</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/3-1.htm" title="Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-9.htm" title="And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make your belly bitter, but it shall be in your mouth sweet as honey.">Revelation 10:9</a>). They are "sweeter than honey and the honeycomb" (<a href="/psalms/19-10.htm" title="More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.">Psalm 19:10</a>). They are incorporated with its life, are "the rejoicing of its heart." He is called by the Name of "the Lord God of hosts," or, more literally, that Name <span class= "ital">is called upon him. </span>As the witness of his special consecration, he becomes, like other prophets, "a man of God" (<a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat thereof.">2Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1Timothy 6:11</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy words were found</span>. Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like "treasure hid in a field;" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can "find" it. But there are some things which no "searching" of the intellect can "find" (<a href="/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; <a href="/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>); yet by a special revelation they may be "found" by God's "spokesmen," or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The "words," or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as "descending" from thence (comp. <a href="/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>) into the consciousness of the prophet.
