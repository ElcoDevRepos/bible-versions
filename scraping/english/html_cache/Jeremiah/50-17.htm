The imagery of a scattered flock is common in the Bible, symbolizing a lack of leadership and protection (<a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5-6</a>). Historically, Israel faced dispersion due to invasions and exiles, leading to a loss of national unity and identity. This scattering is a consequence of Israel's disobedience to God, as warned by the prophets (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>).<p><b>chased away by lions</b><br>Lions represent powerful and destructive forces, often used in Scripture to symbolize enemies or oppressors (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). In this context, the lions are the foreign nations that attacked and exiled Israel. The imagery underscores the ferocity and relentlessness of these nations in pursuing Israel, leading to their scattering.<p><b>The first to devour him was the king of Assyria</b><br>The king of Assyria refers to the Assyrian Empire, which conquered the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC. This event marked the beginning of Israel's dispersion, as the Assyrians deported many Israelites and resettled the land with foreigners (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The Assyrian conquest fulfilled prophetic warnings about the consequences of Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>).<p><b>the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, represents the final blow to the nation of Judah, the southern kingdom. In 586 BC, he destroyed Jerusalem and the Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-11</a>). This event is seen as a divine judgment for Judah's persistent sin and rebellion. The phrase "crush his bones" indicates total devastation and the end of national sovereignty. The Babylonian exile is a pivotal moment in biblical history, setting the stage for future restoration and the coming of the Messiah, who is seen as the ultimate shepherd and restorer of Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as a "scattered flock," symbolizing the nation of Israel's dispersion and vulnerability due to external threats and internal disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lions.htm">Lions</a></b><br>Metaphorically represents the powerful nations and rulers that have attacked and oppressed Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The Assyrian Empire was the first to conquer and exile the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BC, leading to the scattering of the ten tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar,_king_of_babylon.htm">Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon</a></b><br>The Babylonian king who conquered Judah, destroyed Jerusalem, and exiled the Jewish people in 586 BC, completing the scattering of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that played a significant role in the history of Israel's exile, representing God's instrument of judgment against His people for their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God uses nations as instruments of His judgment, demonstrating His control over history and His commitment to justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Israel's scattering serves as a warning about the consequences of turning away from God and His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_for_restoration.htm">Hope for Restoration</a></b><br>Despite judgment, God promises to gather His people, offering hope and restoration for those who return to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership.htm">The Role of Leadership</a></b><br>The leaders of Israel failed to protect and guide the flock, reminding us of the importance of godly leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Even in judgment, God remains faithful to His covenant promises, ensuring that His plans for His people will ultimately prevail.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Jeremiah_50_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Jeremiah 50:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_50_17_God_s_judgment_on_foes.htm">How does Jeremiah 50:17 illustrate God's judgment on Israel's oppressors?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Israel_in_Jeremiah_50_17.htm">What lessons can we learn from Israel's experience in Jeremiah 50:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Jeremiah_50_17_to_Deut_28_promises.htm">How does Jeremiah 50:17 connect with God's promises in Deuteronomy 28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Jeremiah_50_17_to_today_s_spirituality.htm">How can we apply the themes of Jeremiah 50:17 to modern spiritual challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_50_17_on_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">What does Jeremiah 50:17 teach about God's sovereignty over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_50_17_Israel_s_Assyria_Babylon.htm">What historical events does Jeremiah 50:17 refer to regarding Israel's oppression by Assyria and Babylon?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Jeremiah_50_17_God_s_judgment_justice.htm">How does Jeremiah 50:17 illustrate God's judgment and justice in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_flock_scattered_in_Jer_50_17.htm">What is the significance of the imagery of a scattered flock in Jeremiah 50:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_jeremiah_50.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Jeremiah 50?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_for_gaza,_ashkelon_destruction.htm">Zephaniah 2:4 references the destruction of Gaza and Ashkelon;

The "lion" appears here, as in <a href="/daniel/7-4.htm" title="The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.">Daniel 7:4</a>, as the symbol of the great Eastern monarchies.

The prophet returns to the present condition of Israel, who is likened to a sheep scared away from its fold by lions. The ruin wrought by the lions is described first as "devouring" and then as "breaking the bones" of Israel - in either case it is complete destruction, but the completeness is more emphasized by the second figure.
