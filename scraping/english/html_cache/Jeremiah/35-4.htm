Bringing the Rechabites into the temple signifies a solemn and significant event, as the temple was considered the dwelling place of God on earth. This act underscores the importance of the message Jeremiah is about to convey, highlighting the contrast between the Rechabites' obedience and Judah's disobedience.<p><b>to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God</b><br>The mention of a specific chamber indicates the structured and organized nature of the temple complex, which included various rooms for different purposes. Hanan, son of Igdaliah, is described as "a man of God," a title often used for prophets or individuals devoted to God's service. This suggests that the chamber was a place of spiritual significance, possibly used for teaching or prophetic activities, and adds weight to the setting of Jeremiah's demonstration.<p><b>This room was near the chamber of the officials</b><br>The proximity to the chamber of the officials implies a location of importance within the temple, possibly indicating that the events taking place were meant to be observed or acknowledged by those in positions of authority.

Surrounded by godly descendants, governmental officials, and vigilant gatekeepers, the Rechabites&#8217; steadfast obedience is put on elevated display. The verse teaches that God uses physical settings to amplify spiritual lessons, calling every observer&#8212;ancient and modern&#8212;to measured, visible, and enduring faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">I brought them into the house of the Lord . . .</span>--The Temple of Solomon appears from <a href="/1_kings/6-5.htm" title="And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:">1Kings 6:5</a> to have had, like a cathedral, apartments constructed in its precincts which were assigned, by special favour, for the residence of conspicuous priests or prophets. Huldah the prophetess seems to have dwelt in some such apartments known as "the college" (see <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>). In this case the chamber was occupied by the sons of Hanan. He, or Igdaliah (the Hebrew punctuation is decisive in favour of Hanan), is described as "a man of God--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>as a prophet--and therefore sympathising, we may believe, with Jeremiah's work (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-1.htm" title="And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm" title="And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?">1Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/13-1.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD to Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.">1Kings 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/20-28.htm" title="And there came a man of God, and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, Thus said the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the LORD.">1Kings 20:28</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-7.htm" title="Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.">2Kings 4:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-9.htm" title="And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.">2Kings 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-14.htm" title="Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.">1Chronicles 23:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/11-2.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,">2Chronicles 11:2</a>). It would seem, from the narrative, that Jeremiah had no chamber of his own. Here also "the sons of Hanan" are probably a company of scholars under the training of the prophet, Jeremiah introducing as it were the two religious orders to each other. The "princes," as in <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm" title="When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house.">Jeremiah 26:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm" title="Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, see, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.">Jeremiah 36:12</a>, were probably official persons who, though not priests, were entitled to residence in the precincts, as we see in the case of Gemariah in <a href="/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>. The "keeper of the door," as in <a href="/jeremiah/52-24.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">Jeremiah 52:24</a>, was probably one of the higher section of the priesthood. The stress laid on all these details was probably intended to show that the memorable dramatic scene that followed, daring as it seemed, was acted in the presence of representatives of the priestly, prophetic, and official orders. The name of Maaseiah has, however, a special interest attached to it. Shallum, the name of his father, is found in <a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a> as that of the husband of Huldah the prophetess of the reign of Josiah, and he is described as the "keeper of the wardrobe," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>probably of the vestments of the priests, and as dwelling in the "college" (literally, the "second" part, or <span class= "ital">annexe </span>of some other building). It is hardly possible to resist the inference that in the Maaseiah who now appears as receiving Jeremiah and the Rechabites, we have the son of the prophetess who had taken so active a part in the work of reformation in the reign of Josiah, whose influence had coloured the whole of the prophet's life, who had brought up her son within the precincts of the Temple. We are brought as it were into the innermost circle of the prophetic company of Jerusalem, and are reminded of Simeon and Anna, and those who waited for the consolation, for the redemption of Israel (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>). The influence of Shallum may, perhaps, be traced in the fact that the king who appears in history as Jehoahaz had probably been named by Josiah after him (<a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm" title="And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead.">2Kings 23:30</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm" title="And the sons of Josiah were, the firstborn Johanan, the second Jehoiakim, the third Zedekiah, the fourth Shallum.">1Chronicles 3:15</a>), as David named one of his sons after Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm" title="And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,">2Samuel 5:14</a>). It is, perhaps, from this point of view, characteristic of Jeremiah that he adheres in <a href="/jeremiah/22-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,">Jeremiah 22:1</a> to the old name given on his birth, and not to that which he had apparently adopted upon his accession to the throne. The name Shallum, it may be noted, means "retribution," whether for good or for evil. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man of God.</span> The title, according to Hebrew usage, belongs to Hanan, not to his father, and means "prophet" (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>); comp.
