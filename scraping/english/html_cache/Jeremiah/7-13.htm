The "things" refer to the idolatry and disobedience of the Israelites, as detailed in the preceding verses. The phrase "declares the LORD" emphasizes the authority and finality of God's pronouncement. This is a common prophetic formula used to assert divine authority, seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>. The historical context is the reign of King Josiah and his successors, a time of religious reform that was ultimately superficial for many in Judah.<p><b>and because I have spoken to you again and again but you would not listen</b><br>This highlights God's persistent attempts to reach His people through prophets like Jeremiah. The repetition of God's efforts underscores His patience and mercy, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>, where God repeatedly sent messengers to His people. The phrase "you would not listen" indicates a willful disobedience and hardening of hearts, reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>). This refusal to listen is a recurring theme in Jeremiah, illustrating the people's stubbornness and the resulting judgment.<p><b>and I have called to you but you would not answer</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the relational aspect of God's communication with His people. The imagery of calling and not receiving an answer suggests a broken relationship, akin to a parent calling out to a wayward child. This is reflective of God's desire for a covenant relationship, as seen in <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>, where God expresses His love and longing for Israel. The refusal to answer is symbolic of the people's rejection of God's covenant, leading to the inevitable consequences of their actions. This also foreshadows the ultimate call of God through Jesus Christ, who invites all to respond to His message of salvation (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the people of Judah.

God&#8217;s declaration is final and authoritative, echoing His verdict on Manasseh&#8217;s atrocities (<a href="/2_kings/21-9.htm">2 Kings 21:9&#8211;15</a>) and the nation&#8217;s collective guilt (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>).
