In the context of Jeremiah, the prophet is addressing the people of Judah, who have been influenced by surrounding pagan nations. The term "senseless" suggests a lack of understanding or discernment, which is a recurring theme in the Bible when describing those who reject divine wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The word "foolish" in biblical terms often refers to moral and spiritual folly rather than mere lack of intelligence (<a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). This reflects the biblical view that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>instructed by worthless idols</b><br>The phrase "instructed by worthless idols" underscores the futility of seeking guidance from man-made objects. In the ancient Near East, idol worship was prevalent, with people often attributing divine power to crafted images. The Bible consistently condemns idolatry, emphasizing that idols are powerless and cannot provide true guidance or salvation (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>). This phrase also serves as a critique of the nations surrounding Israel, who relied on idols for instruction, contrasting with Israel's reliance on the living God. The term "worthless" indicates the lack of value and power in these idols, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>, which describe idols as having mouths but not speaking, eyes but not seeing.<p><b>made of wood!</b><br>The mention of wood highlights the material nature of idols, emphasizing their human origin and impotence. In the ancient world, idols were often crafted from wood, stone, or metal, materials that were readily available and shaped by human hands. This serves to remind the audience of the absurdity of worshipping something that is created rather than the Creator. The Bible frequently points out the irony of idol worship, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14-17</a>, where a man uses part of a tree to warm himself and the rest to make a god. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on worshiping God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>), contrasting the living God with lifeless idols.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his prophecies concerning the judgment of Judah and the coming exile.
