In the context of Jeremiah, this report likely refers to the threat of invasion by Babylon. The prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah were often ignored, but the reality of the threat is now undeniable. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God sending prophets to warn His people, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, where God reveals His plans to His servants the prophets.<p><b>our hands hang limp.</b><br>The imagery of limp hands symbolizes helplessness and despair. In ancient Near Eastern culture, strong hands were a sign of power and ability, while limp hands indicated defeat and inability to act. This expression is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>, to describe the fear and paralysis that come upon people when faced with overwhelming danger or divine judgment.<p><b>Anguish has gripped us,</b><br>The term "anguish" conveys intense emotional and physical distress. This reflects the deep fear and anxiety experienced by the people of Judah as they face the consequences of their disobedience to God. The gripping nature of anguish suggests an inescapable and consuming force, similar to the descriptions of distress in <a href="/lamentations/1-20.htm">Lamentations 1:20</a>, where the heart is described as being in turmoil.<p><b>pain like that of a woman in labor.</b><br>This simile is a common biblical metaphor for extreme pain and distress, used to describe the severity of the situation. Labor pain is intense and unavoidable, symbolizing the inevitability and intensity of the coming judgment. This imagery is also used in other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>, to describe the suddenness and inevitability of God's judgment. The metaphor also points to the hope of new birth and redemption, as seen in <a href="/john/16-21.htm">John 16:21</a>, where Jesus speaks of the joy that follows the pain of childbirth, hinting at the possibility of restoration after judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and judgment to the people of Judah.

They are not surprised by rumors; they have &#8220;heard the report,&#8221; a clear, credible announcement of God-ordained judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5-6</a>; 5:15). Their awareness removes any excuse for complacency, just as earlier generations were held responsible once they heard Noah&#8217;s preaching (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13, 22</a>) or Nineveh responded to Jonah&#8217;s message (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). Knowing truth heightens accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Our hands hang limp</b><p>Physical strength evaporates when courage fails. Drooping hands picture utter helplessness&#8212;an admission that human resources cannot fend off what God has decreed (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>). The same image appears when Moses tires during Israel&#8217;s battle with Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>); without divine aid, victory is impossible. Here, Jerusalem&#8217;s drooping hands confirm that trust in walls, alliances, and armaments is futile compared with trusting the LORD (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Anguish has gripped us</b><p>The emotional seizure is sudden and overwhelming. Jeremiah elsewhere describes this dread as &#8220;terror on every side&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3-4</a>). When God withdraws His protective hand, fear overruns the heart (<a href="/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36-37</a>). Yet such anguish can become a redemptive alarm, urging repentance before disaster strikes (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>). Those who heed the warning discover that &#8220;the LORD is near to the brokenhearted&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pain like that of a woman in labor</b><p>Labor pains are intense, unavoidable, and signal an imminent outcome. Scripture often uses this picture for coming judgment (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). Jeremiah&#8217;s audience faces contractions of calamity that will not ease until God&#8217;s purpose is delivered&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s siege and exile. The metaphor underscores certainty: once labor starts, birth will follow. Likewise, once God&#8217;s warnings give way to events, the outcome is unstoppable, yet it also implies future hope; after pain, new life can emerge, just as exile ultimately led to restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a> captures a moment when God&#8217;s people finally realize the seriousness of His warnings. Hearing the report removes ignorance; limp hands expose human weakness; gripping anguish reveals spiritual vulnerability; labor pains announce unavoidable, purposeful judgment. The verse calls readers to respond before dread becomes reality, turning from self-reliance to the Savior whose loving discipline intends restoration, not ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">We have heard the fame.</span>--Another dramatic impersonation of the cry of terror from the dwellers in Jerusalem, when they shall hear of the approach of the army.
