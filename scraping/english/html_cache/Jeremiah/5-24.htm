In biblical terms, the "heart" often represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. The absence of genuine reverence for God in their hearts indicates a deep spiritual problem, not just a superficial or external one. This internal rebellion is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God desires sincere devotion rather than mere ritual (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Let us fear the LORD our God</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a foundational concept in the Bible, often associated with wisdom and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). It implies a deep respect, reverence, and awe for God, recognizing His power and authority. The lack of this fear among the people suggests a failure to acknowledge God's sovereignty and a disregard for His commandments, which is a central issue in the prophetic critique of Israel and Judah.<p><b>who gives the rains, both autumn and spring, in season</b><br>The mention of "autumn and spring rains" refers to the agricultural cycle in ancient Israel, where timely rains were crucial for successful harvests. The autumn rains (early rains) would soften the ground for planting, while the spring rains (latter rains) would ensure the crops matured properly. This agricultural dependency on rain underscores God's provision and control over nature, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>, where God promises rain as a blessing for obedience.<p><b>who keeps for us the appointed weeks of harvest</b><br>The "appointed weeks of harvest" refers to the specific times set by God for gathering crops, which were essential for the survival and prosperity of the people. This phrase emphasizes God's role in sustaining life and providing for His people. The harvest periods were also times of celebration and thanksgiving, as seen in the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) and the Feast of Tabernacles, which were tied to the agricultural calendar (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>).

The whole period from October to March has that character. The "early" rains are those that come in autumn, the latter those which close the season in spring. The former argument in what we may call the prophet's natural theology had been drawn from the presence of law in the midst of what seemed the lawless elements of nature. Now he urges that drawn from regularity of succession.

Dr. Robinson remarks that there are not at the present day in Palestine "any particular periods of rain, or succession of showers, which might be regarded as distinct rainy seasons," and that...unless there has been some change m the climate of Palestine, the former and the latter rains seem to correspond to "the first showers of autumn, which revived the parched and thirsty earth and prepared it for the seed, and the later showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the fields" ('Biblical Researches,' 3:98). <span class="cmt_word">He reserveth unto us</span>, etc.; literally, he <span class="accented">keepeth for us the weeks - the statutes of harvest</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the weeks which are the appointed conditions of harvest.
