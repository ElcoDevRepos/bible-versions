It is a call to observe and reflect on the current state of affairs. In the context of Jeremiah, this is a prophetic message urging the people to recognize the severity of their circumstances. The use of "ask" and "see" suggests an inquiry into the reality of their condition, encouraging introspection and awareness.<p><b>Can a male give birth?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the absurdity of the situation being described. In ancient Near Eastern culture, childbirth was exclusively a female experience, and the imagery of a man in labor would have been shocking and unnatural. This serves to emphasize the intensity of the distress and fear that the men of Judah are experiencing. The imagery underscores the unnaturalness of the situation, pointing to a time of unprecedented crisis and upheaval.<p><b>Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor</b><br>The imagery of men clutching their stomachs as if in labor signifies extreme anguish and fear. This metaphor is used to convey the depth of the emotional and physical turmoil facing the people. In the broader biblical context, labor pains are often used as a metaphor for times of great distress and impending judgment (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8</a>). This phrase suggests that the coming judgment is so severe that it causes even the strongest to be overwhelmed with fear and pain.<p><b>and every face turned pale?</b><br>Paleness of face is a common biblical expression for fear and terror (e.g., <a href="/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a>). It indicates a loss of color due to shock or fright, symbolizing the dread that has gripped the people. This imagery reinforces the message of impending doom and the profound impact of the coming judgment. The paleness of face can also be seen as a sign of the people's realization of their helplessness in the face of divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Judah, warning them of impending judgment and offering hope for future restoration.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing imminent invasion and exile due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>The event during which the people of Judah were taken captive by Babylon, serving as a backdrop for Jeremiah's prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_judgment.htm">Understanding God's Judgment</a></b><br>The imagery of men in labor highlights the intensity and inevitability of God's judgment.

The challenge is simple: look around, search history, talk to one another&#8212;nothing like what God is about to describe has ever been witnessed (<a href="/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21</a>).
