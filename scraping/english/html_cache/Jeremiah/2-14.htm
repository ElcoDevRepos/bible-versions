Historically, Israel was delivered from slavery in Egypt, symbolizing their freedom and covenant relationship with God. The question implies that Israel's current state of subjugation is contrary to their intended identity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual freedom versus bondage to sin, as seen in the New Testament where believers are called to live as free people in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><b>Was he born into slavery?</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Israel was not destined for slavery. Unlike nations that were historically enslaved from their inception, Israel's origin is rooted in the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) assured blessings and freedom, not bondage. This serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the intended freedom for His people, contrasting with their current spiritual and physical oppression due to disobedience.<p><b>Why then has he become prey?</b><br>This question addresses the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness and idolatry. By turning away from God, Israel has made itself vulnerable to surrounding nations, becoming prey to their enemies. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to subjugation and suffering. The imagery of becoming prey also foreshadows the New Testament warnings about spiritual vigilance, as believers are cautioned to be alert against the devil, who prowls like a roaring lion (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the nation chosen by God, often depicted as God's firstborn son.

He had already declared, &#8220;I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s identity is that of a redeemed people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-11.htm">Psalm 136:11&#8211;12</a>). They are not property to be owned by nations; they are God&#8217;s treasured possession.<p>&#8226; The question therefore exposes a disconnect: a people liberated by God is now living as if shackled. &#8220;For you were called to freedom&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>) picks up the same principle for all God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Was he born into slavery?</b><p>&#8220;Was he born into slavery?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>b)<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s national birth was miraculous freedom, not bondage.

Like the prodigal son who left his father&#8217;s house (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11&#8211;24</a>), Israel&#8217;s bondage is self-chosen, not inherited.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a> reminds believers that yielding to sin re-enslaves the free: &#8220;You are slaves to the one you obey.&#8221; The principle spans both covenants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why then has he become prey?</b><p>&#8220;Why then has he become prey?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>c)<p>&#8226; Predatory nations such as Assyria and Egypt were already circling (<a href="/jeremiah/2-15.htm">Jeremiah 2:15&#8211;16</a>). They could only pounce because Israel abandoned the protective covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Idolatry is the doorway: &#8220;My people have exchanged their Glory for useless idols&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>). Turning from the fountain of living waters (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>) left them defenseless.<p>&#8226; The imagery shifts from slavery to a hunted animal. Outside God&#8217;s shelter, the flock is exposed (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). Yet even then, the Lord calls, &#8220;Return, O faithless children&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a> warns that the adversary seeks prey.

They were redeemed, not enslaved; birthed into liberty, not bondage; yet they now lie exposed because they stepped outside their covenant refuge. The passage calls every generation to remember its redeemed identity, reject self-imposed chains, and remain under the protective sovereignty of the God who sets captives free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Is Israel a servant?</span>--The word "servant," we must remember, had become, through its frequent use in Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>a word not of shame, but honour; and of all servants, he who was born in the house--as in the case of Eleazar (<a href="/genesis/15-3.htm" title="And Abram said, Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, see, one born in my house is my heir.">Genesis 15:3</a>)--occupied the most honourable place, nearest to a son. The point of the question is accordingly not "Is Israel become a slave," kidnapped, as it were, and spoiled, but rather this: "Is Israel the servant of Jehovah, as one born in His house? Why, then, is he treated as one with no master to protect him?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-19.</span> - Israel's <span class="accented">punishment and its cause</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is Israel a servant</span>? The speaker is evidently the prophet, who exclaims in surprise at the view which his prophetic insight opens to him: "quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur" (Calvin). For Israel is a member of Jehovah's family; he is not a servant (except in the same high sense as in <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-53</a>, where "servant" is virtually equivalent to "representative"), but rather in the highest degree a free man, for he is Jehovah's "firstborn son" (<a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). How is it, then, that he is dragged away into captivity like a slave who has never known freedom? The view of some, that "servant" means "servant of Jehovah" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>), and that the question therefore is to be answered in the affirmative, is less natural. "Servant," by itself, never has this turning; and there is a precisely similar term in the discourse at ver. 31, where the negative answer of the question does not admit of a doubt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a slave?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1506;&#1462;&#1433;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Was he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">born into slavery?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3211.htm">Strong's 3211: </a> </span><span class="str2">Born</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Why then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(mad&#183;d&#363;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4069.htm">Strong's 4069: </a> </span><span class="str2">Why? for what reason?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has he become</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">prey?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1469;&#1494;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7687;az)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_957.htm">Strong's 957: </a> </span><span class="str2">Spoiling, robbery, spoil, booty</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/jeremiah/2-14.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 2:14 Is Israel a servant?
