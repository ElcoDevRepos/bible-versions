The act of blinding was a common practice in the ancient Near East to incapacitate and humiliate defeated kings. It fulfilled the prophecy given by Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>), where it was foretold that Zedekiah would be taken to Babylon but would not see it. This act also symbolizes the spiritual blindness of Judah's leadership, who failed to heed God's warnings through the prophets.<p><b>and bound him with bronze chains</b><br>Bronze chains signify the complete subjugation and humiliation of Zedekiah. Bronze, a strong metal, indicates the permanence and severity of his captivity. This imagery of bondage is often used in Scripture to represent the consequences of sin and rebellion against God (<a href="/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10-11</a>). The binding of Zedekiah serves as a physical manifestation of the spiritual bondage that had overtaken Judah due to their disobedience.<p><b>to take him to Babylon</b><br>Babylon, the center of the Babylonian Empire, was a symbol of human pride and opposition to God, dating back to the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The exile to Babylon represents God's judgment on Judah for their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This event marks the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecies regarding the fall of Jerusalem and the exile (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate redemption and return from exile, pointing to the hope of restoration through Christ, who delivers from spiritual exile and bondage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.
