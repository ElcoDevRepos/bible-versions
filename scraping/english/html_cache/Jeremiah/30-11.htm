The assurance of divine presence is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>. It reflects God's covenant faithfulness, as He promised to be with His people and deliver them. This promise of salvation is both immediate, concerning the return from Babylonian exile, and eschatological, pointing to ultimate redemption through the Messiah.<p><b>Though I will completely destroy all the nations to which I have scattered you,</b><br>Here, God speaks of His judgment on the nations that have oppressed Israel. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian Empire and others that held Israel captive. The destruction of these nations is a fulfillment of divine justice, as seen in the prophetic books like Obadiah and Nahum. This also foreshadows the ultimate judgment of all nations, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>.<p><b>I will not completely destroy you.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's mercy and the preservation of a remnant. Despite Israel's disobedience, God promises not to annihilate them, in contrast to the fate of other nations. This is consistent with His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring the survival and restoration of Israel. The concept of a remnant is significant in prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>.<p><b>Yet I will discipline you justly,</b><br>God's discipline is portrayed as an act of justice, not capricious punishment. This reflects the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves, as a father disciplines his children (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The discipline is meant to correct and restore, not to destroy, aligning with the purpose of bringing Israel back to righteousness and covenant faithfulness.<p><b>and will by no means leave you unpunished.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of divine justice. While God is merciful, He is also just and cannot overlook sin. The punishment serves as a means of purification and correction, ensuring that Israel understands the consequences of their actions. This balance of justice and mercy is central to God's character, as seen throughout the Bible, including in the sacrificial system and ultimately in the atoning work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises both judgment and salvation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel/judah.htm">Israel/Judah</a></b><br>The people of God who are in exile due to their disobedience but are promised restoration.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding nations where Israel has been scattered, which will face destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message of both warning and hope.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The period of punishment and scattering of Israel due to their disobedience, yet with a promise of eventual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_discipline.htm">God's Presence in Discipline</a></b><br>Even in times of discipline, God assures His presence with His people.

God&#8217;s unwavering presence guarantees salvation, yet His holy nature demands just discipline. Nations that oppose Him will face total destruction, but His covenant people will be preserved, refined, and restored. The verse assures believers that the LORD&#8217;s mercy and justice operate together: He rescues, He corrects, and He fulfills every promise without fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Though I make a full end of all nations.--</span>On the phrase, see Notes on <a href="/jeremiah/4-27.htm" title="For thus has the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end.">Jeremiah 4:27</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-10.htm" title="Go you up on her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD's.">Jeremiah 5:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-18.htm" title="Nevertheless in those days, said the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.">Jeremiah 5:18</a>. It is eminently characteristic of the prophets of Jeremiah's time (<a href="/ezekiel/11-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-17.htm" title="Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.">Ezekiel 20:17</a>; <a href="/context/nahum/1-8.htm" title="But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.">Nahum 1:8-9</a>). Here the thought, implied elsewhere, and reproduced in <a href="/jeremiah/46-28.htm" title="Fear you not, O Jacob my servant, said the LORD: for I am with you; for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you: but I will not make a full end of you, but correct you in measure; yet will I not leave you wholly unpunished.">Jeremiah 46:28</a>, is expressed more fully than before, that while the destruction of the national life of the heathen nations on whom judgment was to fall should be complete and irreversible, so that Moab, Ammon, Edom, should no more have a place in the history of the world, the punishment of Israel should be remedial as well as retributive, working out, in due time, a complete restitution. In "correcting in measure" we trace an echo of <a href="/psalms/6-1.htm" title="O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 6:1</a> (see Note on <a href="/jeremiah/10-24.htm" title="O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.">Jeremiah 10:24</a>). That thought sustains the prophet in his contemplation of the captivity and apparent ruin of his people. To be left "altogether unpunished" would be, as in the "let him alone "of <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm" title="Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.">Hosea 4:17</a>, the most terrible of all punishments. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In measure;</span> rather, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>;
