In the prophetic tradition, such declarations are common, underscoring the role of prophets as messengers of God's will. This phrase sets the tone for the seriousness and importance of the message that follows.<p><b>Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind:</b><br>The concept of a curse here is a divine pronouncement of judgment or misfortune. Trusting in mankind implies relying on human wisdom, strength, or systems rather than on God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the futility of human reliance, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/118-8.htm">Psalm 118:8-9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>. Historically, Israel often faced the temptation to form alliances with other nations rather than trusting in God's protection, leading to dire consequences.<p><b>who makes mere flesh his strength:</b><br>"Mere flesh" highlights the frailty and limitations of human beings compared to the omnipotence of God. This phrase warns against placing confidence in human power or military might, a common temptation for Israel during times of political instability. The Bible frequently contrasts the weakness of human flesh with the strength of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>.<p><b>and turns his heart from the LORD:</b><br>Turning one's heart from the LORD signifies a deliberate choice to reject or neglect God in favor of other sources of security or guidance. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel's idolatry and disobedience often led to spiritual and physical downfall. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being and decision-making, making this turning away a profound act of rebellion. This phrase echoes the warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18-20</a> and serves as a call to remain faithful to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, known for his messages of warning and calls for repentance to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, often warned by prophets like Jeremiah for their idolatry and reliance on human alliances rather than God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks through Jeremiah to deliver His message to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Represents human beings in general, emphasizing the folly of placing trust in human strength and wisdom over divine guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart.htm">The Heart</a></b><br>In Hebrew thought, the heart is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions.
