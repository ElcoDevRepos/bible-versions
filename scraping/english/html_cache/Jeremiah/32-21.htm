This event is recorded in the Book of Exodus and is central to Jewish identity and faith. It demonstrates God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The Exodus is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, symbolizing deliverance from sin and bondage.<p><b>with signs and wonders</b><br>The signs and wonders refer to the miraculous events God performed to convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites. These include the ten plagues, such as turning the Nile into blood and the death of the firstborn. These acts displayed God's power over the Egyptian gods and affirmed His sovereignty. In the New Testament, Jesus performed signs and wonders to authenticate His divine authority and mission.<p><b>with a strong hand and an outstretched arm</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's mighty power and active intervention in human history. The "strong hand" and "outstretched arm" are anthropomorphic expressions that convey God's strength and willingness to save His people. This imagery is used throughout the Old Testament to describe God's deliverance and protection, and it foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and with great terror</b><br>The "great terror" refers to the fear and awe inspired by God's mighty acts during the Exodus. This fear was experienced by both the Egyptians and the Israelites, highlighting God's holiness and justice. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of God's judgment against sin and His power to save. This concept of divine terror is echoed in the New Testament, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the people of Judah during a time of great turmoil and impending exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, whom He delivered from slavery in Egypt, symbolizing His covenant relationship and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, representing oppression and the power of God to save.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by God to demonstrate His power and authority, particularly during the Exodus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exodus.htm">Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God leading the Israelites out of Egypt, a foundational moment in Israel's history that showcases God's deliverance and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on how God&#8217;s deliverance of Israel from Egypt is a testament to His faithfulness.
