In the context of Jeremiah, the people of Judah are being warned of the consequences of their rebellion against God. The "cry" signifies the anguish and desperation that will arise when God's judgment is executed. This echoes the cries of the Egyptians during the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>), symbolizing divine retribution.<p><b>when You suddenly bring raiders against them</b><br>The suddenness of the raiders' arrival emphasizes the unexpected nature of God's judgment. Historically, this can be linked to the Babylonian invasions, which were instruments of God's wrath against Judah. The Babylonians, led by Nebuchadnezzar, were known for their swift and devastating military campaigns. This also serves as a reminder of the suddenness of the Day of the Lord, a theme found throughout prophetic literature (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2-3</a>).<p><b>for they have dug a pit to capture me</b><br>This imagery of a pit is often used in the Psalms to describe the schemes of the wicked against the righteous (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/57-6.htm">Psalm 57:6</a>). Jeremiah, as a prophet, faced opposition and plots from his own people. The pit symbolizes the treacherous plans devised by those who reject God's message. It also foreshadows the betrayal and suffering of Jesus Christ, who was plotted against by the religious leaders of His time (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-4</a>).<p><b>and have hidden snares for my feet</b><br>Snares are traps set to ensnare the unsuspecting, illustrating the deceitful and malicious intentions of Jeremiah's adversaries. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the righteous being targeted by the wicked (<a href="/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a>). In a typological sense, it points to Christ, who navigated the snares of the Pharisees and Sadducees, ultimately overcoming their schemes through His death and resurrection (<a

that the very homes of his persecutors become places of sorrow. This is a call for God-sent consequences to be felt in the most personal space they know.<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear when judgment falls on Egypt in <a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>&#8212;&#8220;there was a loud wailing throughout Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/9-19.htm">Jeremiah 9:19</a> pictures Zion&#8217;s own wailing; here, the prophet wants the same piercing lament to rise from those plotting evil. The cry is evidence that sin&#8217;s fallout cannot be contained or hidden behind closed doors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when You suddenly bring raiders against them</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah believes the LORD&#8217;s intervention can come &#8220;suddenly,&#8221; without warning, echoing <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a> where sudden destruction falls on the unrepentant.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Raiders&#8221; points to a military or bandit force God will use as His instrument, much like the Babylonian invaders He often mentions (<a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The surprise element stresses that God&#8217;s justice does not always give advance notice; it arrives on His timetable, leaving no room for escape once His patience ends (<a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm">Isaiah 29:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they have dug a pit to capture me</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah has been the target of schemes (<a href="/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>). Here he likens their plot to hunters digging a trap in the ground.<p>&#8226; David voiced the same experience: &#8220;They dug a pit for me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7</a>; 57:6). Scripture consistently shows the righteous may become prey to malicious plans, yet God keeps account of every pit dug.<p>&#8226; The logic of the prayer: because their attack is deliberate and premeditated, divine retribution is warranted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have hidden snares for my feet</b><p>&#8226; Beyond the pit, snares are covert devices meant to trip a person unaware. Jeremiah&#8217;s foes use secret tactics, not open confrontation.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a> and <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a> remind us that nets and snares symbolize subtle, deceptive dangers&#8212;plots that only God can fully expose.<p>&#8226; Jeremiah is not seeking personal revenge; he is appealing to God&#8217;s justice, aligning with <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jeremiah/18-22.htm">Jeremiah 18:22</a> is a plea that the schemes of the prophet&#8217;s enemies rebound upon them. He asks that their own homes echo with the grief they intended for him, that God&#8217;s sudden judgment arrive through raiders, and that the pits and snares they set become the basis for divine retribution. The verse underscores the certainty that God hears the cries of the righteous, notes every hidden trap, and will act decisively&#8212;often unexpectedly&#8212;to vindicate His servant and uphold His righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jeremiah/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Let a cry be heard from their houses.</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>let their city be taken by the enemy and the people suffer all the outrage and cruelty which their heathen invaders can inflict.
