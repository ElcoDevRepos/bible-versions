This beast is described in <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11-15</a> as having two horns like a lamb but speaking like a dragon, symbolizing deceptive gentleness masking a sinister agenda. The requirement for "all people" indicates a universal imposition, suggesting a global influence and control that transcends national and cultural boundaries.<p><b>small and great, rich and poor, free and slave</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the beast's control, affecting every social and economic class. The inclusion of "small and great, rich and poor, free and slave" highlights the indiscriminate nature of the beast's demand, reflecting a totalitarian regime that does not discriminate based on status or wealth. This mirrors the universality of the gospel message (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), but in a perverse inversion, it is a universal call to allegiance to evil.<p><b>to receive a mark</b><br>The "mark" is a symbol of allegiance and ownership, akin to branding. In the ancient world, marks or tattoos were often used to signify ownership or loyalty, such as slaves being marked by their masters. This mark is a counterfeit to the seal of God on the foreheads of the 144,000 in <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3-4</a>, representing a deliberate choice to follow the beast rather than God.<p><b>on their right hand or on their forehead</b><br>The specific locations of the mark, "on their right hand or on their forehead," are significant. The right hand symbolizes action and power, while the forehead represents thought and will. This suggests a total domination over both the actions and thoughts of individuals. It is a stark contrast to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, where God's commandments are to be bound on the hand and between the eyes, indicating a complete devotion to God. The mark of the beast is a blasphemous parody of this devotion, demanding loyalty to the beast instead of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_beast.htm">The Second Beast</a></b><br>This figure is often interpreted as a false prophet or a representative of evil power, working under the authority of the first beast, which symbolizes a political or worldly power opposed to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_people.htm">All People</a></b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universality of the second beast's influence, affecting every social and economic class without exception.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mark.htm">The Mark</a></b><br>A symbol of allegiance to the beast, this mark is a sign of submission and acceptance of the beast's authority, contrasting with the seal of God on the foreheads of the faithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/right_hand_or_forehead.htm">Right Hand or Forehead</a></b><br>These locations for the mark are significant, as they symbolize actions (right hand) and thoughts or beliefs (forehead), indicating total control over individuals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/economic_control.htm">Economic Control</a></b><br>The context of the mark involves economic transactions, suggesting a system where allegiance to the beast is necessary for participation in society.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/allegiance_and_worship.htm">Allegiance and Worship</a></b><br>The mark represents a choice of allegiance.

The mark on the right hand or forehead is more than an economic credential; it is a counterfeit seal challenging God&#8217;s ownership of mankind. Scripture warns that eternal wrath awaits those who accept it, while everlasting life belongs to those who refuse and remain faithful to the Lamb.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16, 17) <span class= "bld">And he</span> <span class= "bld">causeth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he [i.e., </span>probably, the second wild beast, and not the image, as in the latter clause of the last verse] <span class= "ital">makes all men, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead: </span>(<span class= "ital">and</span>)<span class= "ital"> that no one should be able to buy or to sell but he who has the mark, the name of the wild beast, or the number of his name.</span> We have read of the sealing of the servants of God in their foreheads (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm" title="Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.">Revelation 7:3</a>): we shall hear of it again (<a href="/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>); the power of evil also has its mark or stamp. As slaves received a brand or mark in their flesh, betokening to whom they belonged, so in the spiritual conflict there is on the side of good and of evil a brand or mark. St. Paul spoke of such marks in his own body that proved him a slave of Jesus Christ (<a href="/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>). In the same way the subtle false prophet, the abettor of world-power, seeks to impress a mark on all, on the penalty of complete social exclusion. It is utterly unnecessary to take this brand of evil literally, any more than we took the seal of Christ literally. That seal we understood as spiritual, in the faith and in the character; this evil brand we must interpret in like manner. It surely means the acquiescence in character and action to the principles of this tyrannical world-power: the right hand is the symbol of toil and social intercourse; the forehead is the symbol of character, as time is ever writing its awful tale upon men's brows. There have been days when men's faith has been read only too plainly by a hostile world, and when their simple trust in Christ caused Christians to be suspected, and when "men cast out their name as evil," and when the mark of the beast was worn and gloried in everywhere. We might cite from the history of the past numberless such epochs. But are we sure that the days are gone? Are we sure that it is easy for simple, unaffected goodness and genuine faith to gain all it might gain? Are we sure that honesty, guilelessness, utter and strenuous truthfulness are not weighted in the race of life? The days of the future may bring intenser forms of this tyranny, as the days of the past have shown them; but the days of the present may afford us illustrations of how readily men may lose, lose much and lose terribly, rather than succumb to fashions which violate honour and dishonour Christ. But we read of more than a mark here: we read of a "name," and the "number of a name." What are we to understand by these?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads;</span> <span class="accented">that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or upon their forehead.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "he may give," found in the Textus Receptus, is unsupported by any uncial; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "they may give," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P; and most cursives have either <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Wordsworth translates, "give to themselves," and adds, "a remarkable sentence, intimating <span class="accented">compulsion</span> under the semblance of <span class="accented">choice."</span> But it does not seem fair to press the meaning so far. The third plural is often used in a perfectly general way in the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>, and Moulton's Winer, p. 655), and the Revised Version is probably correct in translating by the passive (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Certainly the other passages in the Apocalypse, where the <span class="accented">mark</span> is mentioned, seem to show that men have absolute freedom of choice (see especially <a href="/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9</a> and Revelation 20:4). Again the beast seeks to imitate God (cf. <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, "I will write upon him my new name;" <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>). The idea is taken kern the Mosaic customs (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>, "And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontiers between thine eyes") Some writers see also an allusion to the heathen custom of branding slaves and others who were devoted to the service of temples; and recall the fact that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, or "cuttings," such as are here mentioned, were forbidden to the Jews (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the second beast] required</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;</span> <span class="translit">(poiei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4160.htm">Strong's 4160: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I make, manufacture, construct, (b) I do, act, cause.
