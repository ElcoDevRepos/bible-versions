The title "Lord God Almighty" emphasizes God's supreme power and authority. This title is used throughout Scripture to denote God's omnipotence and sovereignty (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). The act of giving thanks is a common biblical theme, reflecting a heart of worship and acknowledgment of God's providence and grace (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>).<p><b>the One who is and who was,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal nature, echoing the divine name revealed in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM."

This concept is reiterated in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8 and 4</a>:8, emphasizing God's constancy and reliability in a world of change.<p><b>because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.</b><br>This statement acknowledges a pivotal moment in the eschatological timeline where God's sovereign rule is fully realized. The "great power" refers to God's ultimate authority over creation, which He exercises to bring about His divine purposes. This reign is anticipated throughout Scripture, with prophecies pointing to a future where God's kingdom is established on earth (<a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>).

Giving thanks acknowledges God&#8217;s faithfulness already displayed&#8212;His past acts of creation and redemption (<a href="/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1-26</a>)&#8212;and anticipates the complete fulfillment of His promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Lord God Almighty</b><p>&#8226;

For believers, the verse fuels confident hope; for a rebellious world, it signals that the day of human autonomy is ending. God&#8217;s kingdom is not a distant dream&#8212;at the sounding of the seventh trumpet, its arrival is proclaimed as a present reality soon to be fully revealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE CHORUS OF THE CHURCH OF GOD.</span><p>(17) <span class= "bld">Saying, We give thee thanks . . .</span>--Better,<p>"We thank Thee, O Lord,<p>The God, the Almighty,<p>He that is, and He that was,<p>Because Thou hast taken Thy great power and didst reign.<p>And the nations were angry,<p>And then came Thine anger And the season of the dead to be judged,<p>And to give their rewards to Thy servants the prophets, and to the saints,<p>And to them that fear Thy name, the small and the great,<p>And to destroy them that destroy the earth."<p>On the expression "He that is and He that was," comp, <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm" title="I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, said the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.">Revelation 1:8</a> and the Note there. We can catch the echo of the Second Psalm throughout this chorus of grateful praise. The prayers of the groaning Church (<a href="/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>, and <a href="/context/luke/18-7.htm" title="And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night to him, though he bear long with them?">Luke 18:7-8</a>) and the cries of travailing creation (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a>) have been heard; though the heathen raged and the people imagined a vain thing, their counsel against the Lord and His anointed, His Christ (compare <a href="/revelation/11-16.htm" title="And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,">Revelation 11:16</a>), came to nought; the joy of their triumph was short-lived; the kingdom of evil was but for a moment; the kings were assembled, they passed by, they saw, they were troubled, they hasted away (<a href="/context/psalms/48-4.htm" title="For, see, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.">Psalm 48:4-5</a>); never did the real sovereignty of the Lord cease (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>); but the nations would not believe in His rule; they were not wise; they turned from the kiss of reconciliation, which was life (<a href="/context/psalms/2-10.htm" title="Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be instructed, you judges of the earth.">Psalm 2:10-12</a>); then came His anger, and the season of judgment and the season of reward. The prophets, the saints, and those that fear God's name, the small and the great-- every class and rank of the true servants of the King are included here; none are forgotten; not a cup of cold water, given in His name, shall miss its reward; for not alone the pre-eminent in Christian power and in Christian holiness, but the weak, the struggling, the obscure, the small as well as the great, are remembered: "Unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Zion" (<a href="/psalms/84-7.htm" title="They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appears before God.">Psalm 84:7</a>; Prayer Book version). Nor is the gladness only for this blessing; there is a joy at the overthrow of those who destroy the earth. The reign of evil is the destruction of the earth. The judgments of God are in mercy to stay the spread of destructive powers and principles. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel; the very judgments of God are merciful.

"The elders" are peculiarly indebted to God, since the establishment of his kingdom is the victory of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come;</span> <span class="accented">the Almighty.</span> Omit "and art to come" (Revised Version), with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius, Syriac, Armenian, etc. (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>). Perhaps the future is purposely omitted, since God's "coming" is now an accomplished fact (cf. also <a href="/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>). Because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned; <span class="accented">because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign</span> (Revised Version). God never ceased to reign, though for a time he abrogated his <span class="accented">power.</span> This <span class="accented">power</span> he has now reassumed, and the elders thank him for it, for it is the assurance of the end of the suffering of the Church of God. So in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a> the elders declare that he is worthy to receive the <span class="accented">power</span> which he now visibly exercises. It has, indeed, been exercised before. The preservation of the Church set forth in the visions of the seals, and the punishment of the ungodly shown under the trumpet visions, are effected by means of this power; but now that power is visibly exercised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">saying:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(legontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;We give thanks</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#956;&#941;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Eucharistoumen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2168.htm">Strong's 2168: </a> </span><span class="str2">From eucharistos; to be grateful, i.e. to express gratitude; specially, to say grace at a meal.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to You,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(soi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
