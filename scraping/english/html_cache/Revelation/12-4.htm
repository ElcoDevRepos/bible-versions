The "tail" signifies the power and influence of the dragon, identified as Satan in <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. The "third of the stars" is commonly understood to represent the angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God, as referenced in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-17</a>. The act of hurling them to the earth signifies their expulsion from heaven, aligning with Jesus' statement in <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven." This imagery underscores the cosmic battle between good and evil, with Satan's influence extending to the earthly realm.<p><b>And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth,</b><br>The "dragon" is a symbol of Satan, as clarified later in <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>. The "woman" is often interpreted as representing Israel, the people of God, from whom the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would come. This imagery draws from Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7-8</a>, which speak of Zion giving birth. The dragon's stance before the woman indicates a posture of opposition and threat, reflecting Satan's historical enmity against God's chosen people and his attempts to thwart God's redemptive plan.<p><b>ready to devour her child as soon as she gave birth.</b><br>The "child" is widely understood to be Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who is prophesied to rule all nations with a rod of iron (<a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>). This phrase captures the historical reality of Satan's attempts to destroy Jesus, as seen in Herod's massacre of the infants in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16-18</a>). It also symbolizes the ongoing spiritual warfare against Christ and His followers. The dragon's readiness to "devour" the child highlights the intensity of the spiritual conflict and Satan's determination to oppose God's salvific purposes. This imagery serves as a reminder of the ultimate victory of Christ, despite the adversary's efforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dragon.htm">The Dragon</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the dragon represents the adversary of God and His people.

Satan, in prideful rebellion, led a third of the angels away from God and was judged, cast to earth. From that vantage he set himself against Israel, determined to destroy the promised Messiah at birth. Yet every thrust of the dragon&#8217;s tail, every earth-ward hurling, every predatory stance was overruled. The Child lives, reigns, and will return to finish the victory first announced in Eden. For believers, the verse is both a sober reminder of unseen warfare and a triumphant assurance that God&#8217;s redemptive purposes cannot be stopped.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And his tail . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And his tail drags </span>(or<span class= "ital">, sweeps) away the third part of the stars of the heaven</span>, <span class= "ital">and casts them to the earth.</span> The stars are the light- bearers, the illustrious of earth, who were given by God high place that they might be burning and shining lights for Him. A large proportion of these are drawn away in the train of evil; they are cast down from their high position of noble opportunities of good work and great work; they are dragged down from the height of the grandest possibilities of good to the low level of a life enslaved to evil.<p><span class= "bld">And the</span> <span class= "bld">dragon.</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the dragon stands</span> (not "stood") <span class= "ital">before the woman who is about to bring forth, that whenever she has brought forth he may devour her child</span>. The spirit of evil is represented as ever on the watch to destroy the first tokens of better things. Our minds go back to the hatred and fear of Pharaoh, setting a watch for the offspring of Israel and ordering their destruction; and even more are we reminded of the jealous hatred of Herod seeking the life of the infant Christ. It seems clear that it is on this last incident that the present vision is primarily built up; but its meaning is much wider than this. It shows us that evermore, as Herod waited to destroy Christ, the devil, the old spirit whose malignity wrought through the fears of Pharaoh and of Herod, is on the watch to destroy every token of good and every resemblance to Christ in the world. The mission of the Church is to bring forth in her members this life of Christ before men: the aim of the wicked spirit is to destroy that life. The same hostility which was shown to the infant Christ is active against His children: "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth</span>; <span class="accented">draweth</span> (Revised Version). Not the <span class="accented">stars</span> with which the woman is crowned (see ver. 1), but other <span class="accented">stars.</span> In describing the vast power of the devil, St. John seems to allude to the tremendous result of his rebellious conduct in heaven, in effecting the fall of other angels with himself (<a href="/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). The seer does not here interrupt his narrative to explain the point, but returns to it after ver. 6, and there describes briefly the origin and cause of the enmity of the devil towards God. The <span class="accented">third part</span> (as in <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>) signifies a considerable number, but not the larger part. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born;</span> <span class="accented">which was about to be delivered, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child</span> (Revised Version). A graphic picture of what is true of Christ himself of the Church, both Jewish and Christian, and of every individual member of the Church. This is another example of the personal history of Christ being repeated in the history of his Church. The devil, in the person of Herod, attempts to prevent the salvation of the world; through Pharaoh he endeavours to crush the chosen people of God, through whom the Messiah was to bless all the earth; by means of the power of Rome he labours to exterminate the infant Church of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
