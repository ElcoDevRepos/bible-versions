The blood could symbolize the sacrifice of Christ, reminiscent of His crucifixion, where His blood was shed for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>). It also evokes the imagery of <a href="/isaiah/63.htm">Isaiah 63:1-3</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a warrior with garments stained by the blood of His enemies, symbolizing divine judgment and victory over evil. This duality of sacrifice and judgment is central to understanding the role of Christ in Revelation. The robe signifies His authority and kingship, as garments often represent status and role in biblical texts.<p><b>and His name is The Word of God</b><br>The title "The Word of God" directly connects to the prologue of the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>), where Jesus is identified as the Logos, the divine Word through whom all things were made. This emphasizes His preexistence, divinity, and active role in creation. In the context of Revelation, this title underscores His authority and the power of His spoken word, which is a recurring theme in the book (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16, 2</a>:16). The Word of God is also a means of revelation, indicating that Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God to humanity. This title affirms His role as the ultimate truth and the one who executes God's will, particularly in the final judgment and the establishment of His eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, depicted as a warrior king.

Together they assure us that the same Savior who died for us is coming again to set everything right&#8212;and His victory is as sure as His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood;</span> <span class="accented">and he</span> [<span class="accented">is</span>] <span class="accented">arrayed in a garment</span>, etc. The idea here is evidently derived from <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, "I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury: and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment" (cf. ver. 15). Probably the similarity of this passage has caused the reading, "sprinkled with blood," which is found in a few manuscripts. In the original passage in Isaiah, the <span class="accented">blood</span> is doubtless the <span class="accented">blood</span> of his enemies; but it is possible that there is here a reference to the blood of Christ himself, which he shed in his warfare with Satan. <span class="cmt_word">And his Name is called The Word of God.</span> Only in St. John's writings does this title appear - a strong argument in favour of his authorship of the Apocalypse (cf. <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>). This cannot be the "name" of ver. 12, which, as there explained, is unknown.
