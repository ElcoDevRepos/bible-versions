The loud voice signifies the importance and urgency of their request. In biblical context, crying out often denotes a call for divine intervention or justice, as seen in the Psalms where the righteous cry out to God for help.<p><b>&#8220;How long, O Lord, holy and true,</b><br>The question "How long" is a common biblical lament, expressing a deep yearning for God's justice and intervention, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2</a> and <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>. The address "O Lord, holy and true" acknowledges God's character, affirming His righteousness and faithfulness. This reflects the belief that God, being holy and true, will ultimately act justly and fulfill His promises.<p><b>until You judge those who dwell upon the earth</b><br>This phrase refers to the anticipation of divine judgment upon the earth's inhabitants, often associated with those who oppose God and His people. The concept of divine judgment is a recurring theme in Revelation, where God is depicted as the ultimate judge who will bring justice to the world. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's judgment against sin and evil, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/26-21.htm">Isaiah 26:21</a>.<p><b>and avenge our blood?&#8221;</b><br>The plea for vengeance is rooted in the biblical principle of divine retribution, where God is seen as the avenger of innocent blood, as stated in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>. This reflects the belief that God will vindicate His people and punish those who have wronged them. The cry for vengeance is not personal revenge but a call for God's righteous justice, aligning with the biblical theme of God as the ultimate judge who will right all wrongs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/souls_under_the_altar.htm">Souls under the Altar</a></b><br>These are the martyrs who have been slain for their testimony and faithfulness to God's word.

The forgotten or ignored wrongs of generations come forth from oblivion and cry for vengeance. It is a poetical description, but it is not fiction. The righteous blood shed does fall upon the world in retribution: the laws of God avenge themselves, though the victims do not live to behold the reward of the ungodly. On the epithets <span class= "ital">Holy</span> and <span class= "ital">True,</span> see Notes on <a href="/revelation/3-7.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things said he that is holy, he that is true, he that has the key of David, he that opens, and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens;">Revelation 3:7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they cried with a loud voice, saying;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. the souls cried.</span> Ebrard, Dusterdieck, Hengstenberg, make "the slain" nominative, in contradistinction to the "souls," which is both <span class="accented">unnecessary</span> and unnatural. Zullig compares <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." How long? (comp. <a href="/zechariah/1-12.htm">Zechariah 1:12, 13</a>, "How long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem? And the Lord answered with good words and comfortable words"). No doubt the souls waiting in Paradise are answered by "comfortable words," yet, not having lost their interest in earthly struggles, nor their longing for the triumphant vindication of God's glory, they cry, "How long?," not as needing the time to be shortened for their own sakes, for <span class="accented">they rest</span>, though not yet entered into the fulness of God's glory. O Lord, holy and true; <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">Master, the holy and true</span> (Revised Version). "Master" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) is the correlative of "servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This is the only instance of its occurrence in the Apocalypse. (On "true," see previous passages.) Deal thou not judge and avenge our blood. The cry is not a petition for personal revenge, but a request for the termination of those ills which for a time afflict man, and the termination of which must, by virtue of God's eternal justice, be accompanied by visible retribution on the wicked. (Cf. Bede, "Those souls which offered themselves a living sacrifice to God pray eternally for his coming to judgment, not from any vindictive feeling against their enemies, but in a spirit of zeal and love for God's glory and justice, mid for the coming of that day when sin, which is rebellion against him, will be destroyed, and their own bodies will be raised. And so in that prayer wherein Christ teaches us to forgive our enemies, we are also taught to <span class="accented">say</span>, 'Thy kingdom come.'") The passage has given rise to varying interpretations, which are thought to be more consonant with the spirit of the gospel. Thus I. Williams would understand the souls to represent only the Old Testament saints, especially as it is not explicitly said that they died for the witness of Jesus, as in <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>. On them that dwell on the earth. That is, on the worldly, those who have taken the side of the world in its conflict with Christianity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they cried out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ekraxan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cry aloud, shriek.
