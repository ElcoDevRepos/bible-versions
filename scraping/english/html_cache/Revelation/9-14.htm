The trumpet judgments are a sequence of divine interventions described in Revelation, each increasing in intensity. The number six often symbolizes imperfection or incompleteness in biblical numerology, contrasting with the number seven, which signifies completion or perfection. The trumpet is a common biblical symbol for announcing significant events, often associated with divine intervention or judgment (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Release the four angels</b><br>The command to release the four angels suggests they have been restrained until this specific moment. Angels in the Bible are often seen as messengers or agents of God's will, and their release indicates a divinely appointed time for their mission. The number four can symbolize universality or completeness in the earthly realm, as seen in the four corners of the earth or the four winds (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>, <a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>). These angels are likely to be agents of judgment, as their release is associated with the subsequent events of destruction and woe.<p><b>who are bound</b><br>The fact that these angels are bound implies they are not free to act until God's appointed time. This binding suggests a limitation placed upon them by divine authority, indicating that their power is controlled and only unleashed according to God's sovereign plan. The binding of spiritual beings is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as the binding of Satan (<a href="/revelation/20-2.htm">Revelation 20:2</a>).<p><b>at the great river Euphrates</b><br>The Euphrates River is one of the most significant rivers in the Bible, often associated with the boundaries of the Promised Land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>) and the cradle of early civilization. It is a geographical marker that has historical and prophetic significance. In ancient times, the Euphrates was a formidable natural barrier and a boundary between empires, such as Assyria and Babylon. Its mention here may symbolize a boundary or transition point for the unfolding of end-time events. The Euphrates is also associated with the rise and fall of empires, and its drying up is mentioned later in Revelation as a preparation for the kings of the East (<a href="/revelation/16-12.htm">Revelation 16:12</a>), indicating its continued prophetic importance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sixth_angel.htm">The Sixth Angel</a></b><br>This angel is one of the seven angels with trumpets, each heralding a specific judgment from God.

Believers are called to be aware of the spiritual battles that occur beyond the physical realm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_mercy.htm">Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>The trumpet judgments serve as a warning of God's impending judgment but also reflect His mercy, as they are opportunities for repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prayer.htm">The Role of Prayer</a></b><br>The voice from the altar may symbolize the power of prayer.

Once freed, they unleash a judgment that kills a third of humanity, revealing God&#8217;s precise timing, His sovereignty over all beings, and His faithfulness to fulfill prophecy.

Some are obviously absurd; in all these is considerable doubt and difficulty. The following is offered as a possible solution to some extent, though it is not pretended that every difficulty is satisfactorily disposed cf. In making this suggestion, the following circumstances have been borne in mind: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The trumpet visions seem constructed upon a systematic plan, and therefore it seems likely that this judgment, like the fifth and the seventh, is a spiritual one (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The objects of this punishment are those who commit the sins described in vers. 20, 21. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The vision must have borne some meaning for these to whom it was first delivered. It seems unlikely, therefore, that events are here portrayed which could not possibly have been foreseen and understood by the early Christians. This seems to exclude (except possibly in a secondary sense) all reference to the papacy, etc. (as Wordsworth).  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">saying</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(legonta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
