In biblical context, a throne often represents a place of judgment and kingship. The color white signifies holiness and righteousness, aligning with God's nature. This scene is a depiction of the final judgment, where God will judge all humanity. The imagery of a throne is consistent with other biblical passages that describe God's sovereign rule (e.g., <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a>, <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>).<p><b>and the One seated on it.</b><br>The "One seated on it" refers to God, the ultimate judge. In Christian theology, this is often understood as Jesus Christ, who is given authority to judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>). This aligns with the New Testament portrayal of Christ as the judge of the living and the dead (<a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>). The seated position indicates authority and readiness to execute judgment, a common motif in ancient royal courts.<p><b>Earth and heaven fled from His presence,</b><br>This phrase suggests the overwhelming majesty and holiness of God, before whom even the created order cannot stand. It echoes Old Testament imagery where God's presence causes the earth to tremble (<a href="/psalms/97-5.htm">Psalm 97:5</a>, <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>). The fleeing of earth and heaven signifies the end of the current creation, making way for a new heaven and a new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<p><b>and no place was found for them.</b><br>This indicates the complete dissolution or transformation of the current creation. It emphasizes the finality and totality of God's judgment. The absence of a place for earth and heaven suggests the impermanence of the current world order and the establishment of a new, eternal order. This aligns with prophetic themes found in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>, where the old creation is replaced by a new one.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_white_throne.htm">Great White Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes purity, holiness, and divine authority.

The scene therefore presents the Lord Jesus Christ exercising divine prerogative.<p>&#8226; His seated posture means the case is ready to be heard; the Judge is not scrambling for information (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Every earlier throne&#8212;whether earthly or demonic&#8212;has already fallen (<a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>), leaving only His.

It is a white throne, in token of the purity of the judgment which follows. He who sits upon it is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. It is asked, Who is He that is seated here? Throughout the book God is called "Him that sitteth upon the throne" (<a href="/revelation/4-3.htm" title="And he that sat was to look on like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald.">Revelation 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm" title="And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.">Revelation 5:1</a>); but we must not understand this as excluding the Son of God, who sits with His Father on His throne (<a href="/revelation/3-21.htm" title="To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.">Revelation 3:21</a>), and who, as Son of Man, declared that He would sit upon the throne of His glory and divide "all the nations" as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats (<a href="/context/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31-32</a>; comp. also <a href="/revelation/6-16.htm" title="And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:">Revelation 6:16</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15-18</a>). At the face of Him who sits upon the throne the heaven and earth flee. Hengstenberg interprets this of the putting out of the way "all of the irrational creation which had been pressed into the service of sin." Gebhardt interprets it of "the <span class= "ital">destruction</span> of the whole <span class= "ital">present</span> visible <span class= "ital">world."</span> A comparison, however, of the imagery employed in <a href="/context/revelation/6-12.htm" title="And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, see, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;">Revelation 6:12-14</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19-20</a>, should make us cautious of asserting that any great physical catastrophe is described here. Doubtless revolution must precede renewal (<a href="/revelation/21-1.htm" title="And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.">Revelation 21:1</a>); but it is never safe to ground our expectations of the nature of such changes upon language which is confessedly poetical in form. Some physical revolutions do in all probability await our earth, but the eye of the prophet looks more to the moral and spiritual regeneration of the world--more to the spiritual well-being of mankind, than to any physical changes which may synchronise with the culmination of the world's moral history. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a great white throne.</span> <span class="accented">And I saw</span>; introducing a new phase of the vision (el. ver. 1, etc.).
