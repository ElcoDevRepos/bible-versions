The opening of the temple in heaven suggests a moment of significant spiritual insight and the unveiling of divine mysteries. In biblical context, the temple represents God's dwelling place, and its opening indicates a direct connection between heaven and earth. This imagery is reminiscent of the tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), symbolizing the removal of barriers between God and humanity.<p><b>and the ark of His covenant appeared in His temple</b><br>The appearance of the ark of the covenant is a powerful symbol of God's presence and faithfulness. Historically, the ark was housed in the Holy of Holies within the earthly temple, representing God's covenant with Israel. Its presence in the heavenly temple underscores the continuity and fulfillment of God's promises. The ark is associated with God's law, mercy, and guidance, as seen in its contents: the tablets of the law, Aaron's rod, and manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). This vision connects to the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant through Jesus Christ, who embodies the law and the prophets.<p><b>And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm</b><br>These natural phenomena are often associated with divine judgment and theophany in Scripture. Similar imagery is found at Mount Sinai during the giving of the law (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>) and in other prophetic visions (<a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, <a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>). The combination of lightning, thunder, earthquake, and hailstorm signifies God's power and the seriousness of His judgments. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence. This imagery also foreshadows the final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom, as seen throughout the book of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_god_in_heaven.htm">The Temple of God in Heaven</a></b><br>This represents the heavenly dwelling place of God, signifying His presence and authority.

The opened sanctuary guarantees intimate access for His redeemed; the visible ark certifies that every promise stands; the accompanying storm signals that the Lord is about to act decisively in judgment and salvation. What John saw, we can trust: God&#8217;s presence is secure, His covenant is sure, and His coming intervention is certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">And the temple of God </span>. . .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And</span> <span class= "ital">the temple of God was opened in the heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and a great hail.</span> At the beginning of the chapter we noticed the distinction between the two words (<span class= "ital">naos</span> and <span class= "ital">hieron)</span> applied to the Temple; the Temple building proper (the <span class= "ital">naos)</span> was measured off. Now this (<span class= "ital">naos</span>) Temple is opened, yes, to its very inmost recesses; for not the holy place alone is disclosed, but the holiest, of all, the shrine of shrines, into which the high priest alone--and he only once a year--entered, is opened, as though anew the veil of the Temple had been rent in twain, and there the ark of the covenant of God is seen. The meaning of this, when read by the light of the measuring of the Temple, seems to be that now the secret abode of the safe-guarded children of God was revealed. In the hour of apostasies and worldliness the faithful had found their strength and protection in the shadow of the Almighty; they were regarded by God as His true living Temple, and in them He dwelt, as they, too, found their defence in Him. But now that the end has come there is no need that these should be hidden any more. The children of God, who are the Temple of God, are made manifest; and at the same time the secret spot of their shelter in troublous days is made plain, and in it is seen the token of that everlasting covenant which was the sheet-anchor of their hopes in the day of their trouble (<a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm" title="Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;">Hebrews 6:19</a>). The ark of God's covenant is seen; the ark which contained the tables of the law, the rod of Aaron, and the manna is unveiled; and now is known whence they derived that hidden manna, that bread of heaven which strengthened their hearts in the days of temptation; now is known how it was that the rod of Christ's power flourished and blossomed in spite of oft-repeated rejection; now, too, are known those high and holy principles by which the lives of the saints of God were ruled, even that law which the divine Spirit had written in their hearts (<a href="/hebrews/10-16.htm" title="This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, said the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;">Hebrews 10:16</a>, and <a href="/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2Corinthians 3:2</a>). Then, too, with the ark of God's covenant, is brought into view the mercy-seat, that throne of grace to which the weary and heavy-laden children of God had so often gone, and where they had never failed to receive grace to help in every time of need (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm" title="Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.">Hebrews 4:16</a>). The Temple of God was opened, and the secret springs of power which sustained the patience and faith of the saints are found to be in God. And out of the opened Temple, or round about it, as round the sacred peak of Sinai, the lightnings are seen and voices and thunders are heard: the tokens of that holy law which the power of the world had defied are made manifest; for God's righteousness has not lost its strength, and that which is a power of help to those who seek their shelter in God becomes a power of destruction to those who turn from Him. The habitation of God is an open sanctuary to faith; it is a clouded and lightning-crowned Sinai to faithlessness. (Comp. <a href="/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>.) The spirit of evil, of selfishness, of luxuriousness, of profanity, which rejects its birthright, of better thoughts and holy things, leads to "the mount that burned with fire, and unto blackness and darkness and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words;" the Spirit of God leads to "the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and Church of the first-born which are written in heaven."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the temple of God was opened in heaven;</span> <span class="accented">and there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven</span> (Revised Version). "The temple" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the dwelling place of God (cf. ver. 1; <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). Again, but a glimpse is afforded; and yet more is revealed than at the conclusion of the former series of visions; while the chief description is reserved to a later part of the Revelation. <span class="cmt_word">And there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament;</span> or, <span class="accented">ark of his covenant.</span> This seems to be introduced in order to render more emphatic the steadfastness and unchangeableness of God. As in the case of the witnesses, the figure is taken from the Old Testament, and the symbol would be pregnant with meaning to Jewish Christians and ethers who had learnt to think of the ark as the sacrament of God's abiding presence and continual help. He who now promises aid to his people, and threatens judgment upon the wicked, is the same God who formerly had displayed his power on behalf of his people Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail;</span> <span class="accented">there followed</span> (Revised Version). The usual token of any special manifestation of God's presence, or direct dealing with men (see on Revelation 6:1). This, then, forms the conclusion to the series of trumpet visions. These visions, evoked by the cry for vengeance in <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, have demonstrated the need for patience and endurance on the part of Christians, by indicating the punishments meted out to the wicked on this earth and at the final judgment, together with the final triumph of the faithful. The seer next proceeds to elaborate a fact alluded to in the measuring of the temple in <a href="/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>, and to point the moral that it is possible for Christians within the Church to lose their final reward by their apostasy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
