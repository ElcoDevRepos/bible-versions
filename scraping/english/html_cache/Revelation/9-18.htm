The fraction "a third" is symbolic of a partial but substantial judgment, reflecting God's restraint in not allowing total destruction. This echoes earlier judgments in Revelation, such as the trumpet judgments, where a third of various elements are affected (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7-12</a>). It serves as a warning and a call to repentance, highlighting the seriousness of sin and the need for divine justice.<p><b>by the three plagues</b><br>The term "plagues" connects to the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, where God used plagues as instruments of judgment and deliverance. In Revelation, plagues are a recurring theme, symbolizing divine retribution and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings. These plagues are part of the trumpet judgments, which are designed to lead humanity to repentance and acknowledge God's sovereignty.<p><b>of fire, smoke, and sulfur</b><br>These elements are reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), where fire and sulfur were used as instruments of divine judgment. Fire, smoke, and sulfur are often associated with hell and eternal punishment (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10-11, 20</a>:10), symbolizing the consuming and purifying nature of God's judgment. They also reflect the imagery of volcanic activity, which would have been familiar to the ancient audience, symbolizing sudden and overwhelming destruction.<p><b>that proceeded from their mouths</b><br>This phrase suggests that the source of the plagues is the demonic cavalry described earlier in <a href="/revelation/9-17.htm">Revelation 9:17</a>. The imagery of something proceeding from the mouth can symbolize the power of words and commands, as seen in the creative and destructive power of God's word (Genesis 1, <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).

It is not once only in the history of the world that such powers have been let loose. The desolations wrought by invading hordes-- the force and ferocity of Turkish power establishing itself in Europe and threatening the power of Christendom--the widespread terror and slaughter promoted by the outbreak of the spirit of unrestrained violence in France, followed by reckless war, may illustrate such a vision as the present; but the main teaching of it is the never-failing truth that the spirit of worldliness provokes its own punishment, wherever it may exist, and its retribution is in a form which serves to reveal what latent power of destruction lurks behind every sin, and what hidden spiritual foes there are to intensify human passions and to increase human misery.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths;</span> <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">these three plagues</span> (as in Revised Version)... <span class="accented">the brimstone, which proceeded.</span> Although the last clause technically is attached to "brimstone" only, yet the description applies to all three of the things mentioned.
