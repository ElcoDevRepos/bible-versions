By naming the city, the Lord affirms He sees their exact situation, just as He saw the hardships of Smyrna (<a href="/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>) and the works of Ephesus (<a href="/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>).<p>- The command &#8220;write&#8221; reminds us the message is not a suggestion but divine instruction, echoing the call to record God&#8217;s words in <a href="/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. Scripture is written revelation meant to be read, believed, and obeyed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These are the words of the One who holds the sharp, double-edged sword</b><p>- The Speaker is Jesus, already revealed in <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>: &#8220;out of His mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword.&#8221; He alone &#8220;holds&#8221; it&#8212;Jesus possesses decisive authority over truth and judgment (cf. <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>).<p>- A &#8220;sharp&#8221; sword penetrates without dullness; nothing escapes its edge. <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a> describes God&#8217;s word as &#8220;sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing to divide soul and spirit,&#8221; affirming that the same Word now addresses Pergamum.<p>- A &#8220;double-edged&#8221; blade cuts both ways&#8212;comfort for the faithful, correction or discipline for the wayward (see <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>). The image assures the church that Christ will both defend them and confront sin within them.<p>- By highlighting the sword before praising or reproving, Jesus signals that His assessments are final; cultural power in Pergamum pales beside the King who bears the sword (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> reminds earthly rulers wield swords by God&#8217;s allowance, but here the ultimate Sword is in Christ&#8217;s hand).<p>- The emphasis on Christ&#8217;s spoken &#8220;words&#8221; reinforces verbal inspiration: when He speaks, it is Scripture, fully reliable and literally true (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/2-12.htm">Revelation 2:12</a> opens Christ&#8217;s letter to Pergamum by:<p>&#8226; identifying the specific church under His watchful eye, proving every congregation matters;<p>&#8226; commanding the message to be written, underscoring the permanence and authority of Scripture;<p>&#8226; presenting Jesus as the Sovereign who wields the sharp, double-edged sword, assuring believers of His power to judge rightly and defend faithfully. Knowing who speaks and where He speaks into our lives prepares us to heed the rest of His counsel with reverent obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Pergamos.</span>--Unlike Ephesus and Smyrna, Pergamos was not distinguished as a commercial city. Its importance was due to other causes. A striking coneshaped hill rose from the plain which bordered the northern banks of the Caicus. The hill was considered sacred. Its value as a strong natural fortress was early recognised, and it was used as a keep and treasury where local chieftains deposited their wealth. Its greatness as a city dated from Eumenes II., who was given by the Romans a large surrounding territory, and who fixed Pergamos as his royal residence. Under his auspices a splendid city--rich in public buildings, temples, art galleries, and with a library which rivalled that of Alexandria--rose into being. It has been described as a city of temples, "a sort of union of a pagan cathedral city, an university town, and a royal residence." It retained its splendour even after it passed by bequest to the Roman Republic, and was declared by Pliny to be a city unrivalled in the province of Asia.<p><span class= "bld">Sharp sword with two edges.</span>--See Note on <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>. The appropriateness of this language to the state of the church in Pergamos will best appear afterwards. (See Note on <a href="/context/revelation/2-15.htm" title="So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.">Revelation 2:15-16</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> - The <span class="accented">epistle to the Church at Pergamum.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pergamum</span> is the usual form both in Greek and Latin writers; "Pergamus" is very rare. And if <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were right here, why "Pergamos" any more than "Ephesos"? The city lies north of Smyrna, in Mysia Major, or the right bank of the Caicus. Pergamum is first mentioned by Xenophon, and becomes important and magnificent under Attalus, the friend of the Romans (B.C. 241-197), and his son Eumenes (B.C. 196-159). Its library was second only to that of Alexandria; but Mark Antony took it to Egypt and gave it to Cleopatra. Parchment gets its name from Pergamum, and Galen the physician was born there. Pliny writes of "longe clarissimum Asiae Pergamum" - a description which probably has reference to its buildings. It still exists under the slightly changed name of <span class="accented">Bergamah</span>, or <span class="accented">Bergma</span>; and its ruins still tell of the magnificent public edifices which have caused it to be described as a "city of temples," and again as "a sort of union of a pagan cathedral city, a university town, and a royal residence." Its idolatrous rites were frequent and various, and the contamination which they spread is manifest from this epistle. <span class="cmt_word">The sharp two-edged sword</span> (see notes on Revelation 1:16 and Revelation 2:13). How much this weapon is needed is shown by the evils protested against. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
