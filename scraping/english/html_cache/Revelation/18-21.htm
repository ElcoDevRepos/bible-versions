The description of the angel as "mighty" emphasizes the power and authority given by God to execute judgment. The "stone the size of a great millstone" symbolizes a heavy and significant object, indicating the severity of the impending judgment. Millstones were large, heavy stones used for grinding grain, and their size and weight make them apt symbols for destruction. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>, where a stone is used to symbolize the sinking of Babylon, indicating a complete and irreversible downfall.<p><b>and cast it into the sea,</b><br>The act of casting the stone into the sea signifies the total and sudden destruction of Babylon. In biblical symbolism, the sea often represents chaos, judgment, or the nations. The imagery of something being thrown into the sea suggests a forceful and decisive action, indicating that Babylon's fall will be both dramatic and conclusive. This action echoes the fate of the Egyptian army in <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4-5</a>, where they were cast into the sea, symbolizing God's judgment and deliverance of His people.<p><b>saying: &#8220;With such violence the great city of Babylon will be cast down,</b><br>The phrase "with such violence" underscores the intensity and swiftness of Babylon's destruction. Babylon, historically a symbol of human pride and opposition to God, represents a system of worldly power and corruption. The "great city" refers to the culmination of human rebellion against God, often interpreted as a future manifestation of a corrupt world system. The casting down of Babylon is a fulfillment of prophetic judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a>, where Babylon's fall is foretold as a divine act of retribution.<p><b>never to be seen again.</b><br>This phrase indicates the finality and completeness of Babylon's destruction. The idea of "never to be seen again" suggests that Babylon's influence and power will be utterly eradicated, leaving no trace of its former glory. This echoes the prophetic declarations in <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/51-62.htm">Jeremiah 51:62</a>, where Babylon's desolation is described as permanent. Theologically, this signifies the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom over all earthly powers and the establishment of His eternal reign, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21-22</a>, where the new heaven and new earth are revealed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_angel.htm">Mighty Angel</a></b><br>A powerful celestial being tasked with delivering God's message and executing His judgment.

Their strength and authority flow from the Lord of hosts. By introducing &#8220;a mighty angel,&#8221; the verse signals that what follows is neither ordinary nor symbolic only&#8212;it is a real, divinely directed act that no earthly force can resist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Picked up a stone the size of a great millstone</b><p>A millstone was a massive stone used for grinding grain; Jesus spoke of it as an object so heavy that it would drag a person to the depths if tied around the neck (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>). Jeremiah enacted Babylon&#8217;s doom by tying a stone to a scroll and sinking it in the Euphrates (<a href="/jeremiah/51-63.htm">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>). The angel&#8217;s choice of a millstone underscores:<p>&#8226; immensity&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s power looks impressive, but the angel lifts the stone with ease.<p>&#8226; inevitability&#8212;the weight guarantees that, once dropped, it will never resurface.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cast it into the sea</b><p>The sea swallows the stone just as God once hurled Pharaoh&#8217;s armies into the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1, 21</a>).

Earlier prophecies announced, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; 18:2). God&#8217;s wrath accumulated until the appointed moment (<a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>).

Jeremiah enjoined Seraiah to bind the prophetic roll to a great stone, and cast them together into the Euphrates. The meaning of the act was explained--"Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise," &c. (<a href="/context/jeremiah/51-63.htm" title="And it shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of Euphrates:">Jeremiah 51:63-64</a>). The great dead mass, sinking helplessly by the law of its own weight, signified a fall past recovery. So Pharaoh and his host sank like lead in the mighty waters. It is the doom Christ foreshadowed as awaiting those who caused His children to fall (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm" title="But whoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.">Matthew 18:6</a>). The mighty angel, strong to lift the ponderous stone, throws it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence (or, <span class= "ital">with a bound</span>) shall Babylon, the great city, be thrown, and shall not be found any more. At one bound, without a single resting-stage in its downward career, without chance or power of recovery, the vast world-city would fall. She who sat as a queen upon many waters, sinks as a stone in the mighty waters. She will not be found any more. The words "any more," or "no more," are repeated in these verses no less than six times, like a funeral knell over the departed greatness which is described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a mighty angel took up a stone like a groat millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying;</span> <span class="accented">add one strong angel</span> (cf. the "mighty voice" in ver. 2; also <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1</a>, and elsewhere). The adjective, of course, refers to the mightiness of the deed wrought (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/51-61.htm">Jeremiah 51:61-64</a>, "Thou shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates; and thou shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise," etc.).
