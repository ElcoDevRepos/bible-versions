The act of looking signifies John's active participation in the vision, emphasizing the importance of what he is about to witness. This is a common motif in apocalyptic literature, where the seer is guided through a series of visions.<p><b>and I heard the voices of many angels</b><br>Hearing the voices of angels highlights the auditory aspect of the vision, emphasizing the grandeur and majesty of the heavenly realm. Angels are often depicted as messengers and servants of God throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, where they serve and worship God. Their voices contribute to the worship and proclamation of God's glory.<p><b>encircling the throne</b><br>The throne is central to the vision, symbolizing God's sovereign rule and authority. The encircling of the throne by angels suggests a scene of worship and reverence, similar to <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>, where seraphim surround God's throne. This imagery underscores the holiness and majesty of God, with the throne as the focal point of divine governance.<p><b>and the living creatures and the elders</b><br>The living creatures and elders are significant figures in the heavenly court. The living creatures, described in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, are often associated with cherubim or seraphim, representing aspects of God's creation and attributes. The elders, numbering twenty-four, likely symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles, representing the fullness of God's people. Together, they participate in the worship of God, highlighting the unity of creation and redemption.<p><b>And their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands</b><br>This phrase conveys an innumerable multitude, emphasizing the vastness and magnitude of the heavenly host. The use of "myriads" and "thousands" is a common biblical expression to denote an uncountable number, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>. This multitude reflects the overwhelming glory and power of God, with countless beings engaged in worship. It also points to the fulfillment of God's promises, where multitudes from every nation and tongue will worship Him, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who receives the vision and records it.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings who serve God and are present in the vision, worshiping around the throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>Four beings described earlier in Revelation, symbolizing aspects of creation and God's attributes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Twenty-four elders representing the redeemed people of God, possibly symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>The central place of God's authority and presence in heaven, around which the worship takes place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_majesty_of_god's_throne.htm">The Majesty of God&#8217;s Throne</a></b><br>The vision of countless angels and elders around the throne emphasizes God's supreme authority and the reverence He commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_worship.htm">The Universality of Worship</a></b><br>The presence of myriads of angels and elders signifies that worship is a universal response to God's holiness and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_angels_in_worship.htm">The Role of Angels in Worship</a></b><br>Angels are depicted as active participants in worship, reminding us of the spiritual reality and the importance of worship in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_community_of_believers.htm">The Community of Believers</a></b><br>The elders represent the community of believers, encouraging us to join in worship and live in unity as part of God's redeemed people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">The Assurance of God&#8217;s Sovereignty</a></b><br>The scene reassures believers of God's control over all creation, providing comfort and hope amidst earthly challenges.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_5_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 5:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Rev_5_11_on_worship_today.htm">How does Revelation 5:11 inspire our worship and praise practices today?

Each new gaze reveals more of God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>) and invites us to lift our own eyes above earthly pressures (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>). Like Ezekiel&#8217;s shifting visions (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), John&#8217;s attentive watching models an expectant faith that trusts God to unveil truth in His time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and I heard the voices of many angels</b><p>John&#8217;s ears now join his eyes.

Angels form a perfect circle, reflecting order, harmony, and the limitless reach of divine sovereignty (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-3</a>). The throne&#8217;s placement at the scene&#8217;s heart reminds believers that every created being finds purpose in orbiting the Lord, not vice versa (<a href="/psalms/97-1.htm">Psalm 97:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;and the living creatures and the elders</b><p>The four living creatures (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>) and the twenty-four elders (<a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4, 10</a>) stand shoulder to shoulder with the angelic host. These two groups picture all creation&#8212;angelic and redeemed humanity&#8212;joining voices. Their togetherness anticipates the church&#8217;s destiny to reign with Christ (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>) and shows that no division mars heavenly worship (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands</b><p>John piles up terms to convey a crowd beyond calculation&#8212;innumerable, inexhaustible praise (<a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). A literal reading affirms that heaven teems with untold multitudes of loyal angels. For the believer, this countless host testifies that God is never outnumbered, His kingdom never threatened (<a href="/2_kings/6-16.htm">2 Kings 6:16-17</a>).

If the Revelation is true, there can be no breach in the sympathies of any part of God's voluntary and intelligent universe." It is needless to observe that the numbers are not to be taken literally; they are simply employed to express the countless throng of that "innumerable company of angels" (<a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>) which raised the song--<p>"Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<p>As from blest voices, uttering joy."<p><span class= "ital">--Paradise Lost,</span> iii. 346, 347.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld</span> marks a new feature of the vision, viz. the introduction of the angelic host as taking part in the adoration of the Lamb (see on Revelation 4:1). <span class="cmt_word">And heard the voice of many angels</span>; a <span class="accented">voice.</span> The angels who have "desired to look into" the mystery of the redemption of the world (<a href="/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>) have now had declared to them "by the Church the manifold wisdom of God, according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord" (<a href="/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10, 11</a>); and are thus enabled to join in the song of the redeemed. <span class="cmt_word">Round about the throne and the beasts and the elders.</span> The innumerable company of angels encircle the throne and the beasts and the elders. Thus the throne is in the vision seen as occupying the centre, the four living creatures are placed round it in different directions; the elders form the next circle, and the angels enclose the whole.
