In the biblical context, kings often symbolize power and authority. The assembly of kings here is reminiscent of other biblical gatherings for battle, such as in <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, where kings set themselves against the Lord. This assembly is orchestrated by demonic spirits (<a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>), highlighting the spiritual warfare aspect of the end times.<p><b>in the place</b><br>The term "place" suggests a specific geographical location, which is significant in biblical prophecy. This location is not just a physical site but also a symbolic setting for the culmination of divine judgment. The specificity of a "place" underscores the tangible reality of the events described in Revelation.<p><b>that in Hebrew is called Armageddon</b><br>Armageddon is derived from the Hebrew "Har Megiddo," meaning "Mount of Megiddo." Megiddo was an ancient city located in northern Israel, strategically positioned on the trade route between Egypt and Mesopotamia. Historically, it was the site of numerous battles, such as those involving Pharaoh Thutmose III and King Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>). Theologically, Armageddon represents the ultimate confrontation between good and evil, as prophesied in the Old Testament. This battle is seen as the final showdown before the establishment of God's kingdom, echoing themes from <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14</a>.

It is the high table-land surrounded by hills which was the great battle-field of the Holy Land. There the fortunes of dynasties and kingdoms have been decided; there the cause of liberty has triumphed; there kings fought and fell; there Gideon and Barak were victorious; there Ahaziah and Josiah were slain. The old battle-ground becomes the symbol of the decisive struggle. It is raised in meaning: it is a type, not a locality. The war of principles, the war of morals, the war of fashion culminates in an Armageddon. The progress of the spiritual struggle in individual men must lead in the same way to a mountain of decision, where the long-wavering heart must take sides, and the set of the character be determined. "There is no waving of banners and no prancing of horses' hoofs; the warfare is spiritual, so that there is in sight neither camp nor foe." It is that conflict which emerges out of various opinions and diverse principles: "the religious tendencies of the times" are (as we have been reminded) powers marshalling themselves for the battle of Armageddon. We must not look for great and startling signs: the kingdom and the conflict of the kingdom is within and around us (<a href="/context/luke/17-20.htm" title="And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:">Luke 17:20-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon;</span> or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they gathered</span>; that is, the "spirits" of ver. 14, of which this is a continuation, the same verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> being repeated.
