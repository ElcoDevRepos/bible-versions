This imagery is rooted in the Passover lamb of <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and the prophetic vision of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. In Revelation, the Lamb symbolizes victory through sacrifice, contrasting with worldly power.<p><b>standing on Mount Zion</b><br>Mount Zion is a significant biblical location, often representing the city of Jerusalem and the spiritual center of God's kingdom.

In prophetic literature, Zion is depicted as the place where God will establish His rule and gather His people (<a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-3</a>).<p><b>and with Him 144,000</b><br>The 144,000 is a symbolic number representing a complete and perfect group of God's people.

It contrasts with the mark of the beast mentioned in <a href="/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16-17</a>. This imagery reflects the ancient practice of marking slaves or soldiers to indicate allegiance.

Having described (<a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. and 13.) the trinity of enemies with which Christ and his people contend, the vision now passes on to depict the blessedness in store for the faithful Christian, and, on the other hand, the final fate of the dragon and his adherents. We are thus once more led to the final judgment. And just as in the former vision, after the assurance of the salvation of the faithful (<a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>.), came the denunciation of woe for the ungodly (<a href="/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8-11:14</a>), leading once more to a picture of the saved (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15-19</a>), so here we have the assured blessedness of the faithful portrayed (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-13</a>), followed by the judgments upon the ungodly (<a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14 - 18:24</a>), and leading on once more to a picture of the saints in glory (<a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Zion;</span> <span class="accented">and behold, the Lamb standing on the Mount Zion</span>, as in the Revised Version. "The Lamb," with the article, referring to "the Lamb" described in <a href="/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a>, whom the second beast had attempted to personate. He stands on Mount Zion (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, "Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem"). The appropriateness of the position is seen <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in its strength (cf. the position of the beast, rising from the sea, perhaps standing on the sand, <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; and cf. <a href="/psalms/87-1.htm">Psalm 87:1, 2</a>, "His foundation is in the holy mountains. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob"). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because there is the temple of God, in the midst of which is <span class="accented">the Lamb</span>, and there is the new Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Zion is the new Jerusalem, the opposite extreme to Babylon (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">And with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's Name written in their foreheads.</span> The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">his Name and his Father's Name</span>, adopted in the Revised Version, is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, with most cursives, versions, and Fathers. Note the similarity to the description in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. Here, as there, the hundred and forty-four thousand are those "redeemed from the earth" (ver. 3). The number denotes a large and perfect number; a multitude of which the total is complete (see on Revelation 7:4). In <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. the sealing in the forehead is described.
