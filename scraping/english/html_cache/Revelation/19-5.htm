In the context of Revelation, the throne is often associated with God's presence and rule (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>). The voice could be interpreted as an angelic messenger or a direct command from God, emphasizing the importance and divine origin of the message. The throne room imagery is reminiscent of Old Testament visions, such as <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, where God's majesty and authority are central themes.<p><b>&#8220;Praise our God,</b><br>The call to praise is a common biblical exhortation, found throughout the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150:1-6</a>) and other scriptures, emphasizing worship as a response to God's greatness and deeds. The use of "our God" indicates a communal relationship between God and His people, reflecting the covenant relationship seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>. This phrase underscores the unity of believers in worship and acknowledges God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>all you who serve Him,</b><br>This phrase identifies the audience as those who serve God, which includes both heavenly beings and faithful believers on earth. Service to God is a recurring theme in scripture, highlighting obedience and dedication (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The call to serve is not limited to a specific group but extends to all who are committed to God's will, reflecting the inclusive nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>and those who fear Him,</b><br>The fear of the Lord is a foundational biblical concept, representing reverence, awe, and respect for God's holiness and power (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's authority and aligning one's life accordingly. It is a characteristic of true worshippers and is often linked with wisdom and understanding (<a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>).<p><b>small and great alike!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusivity of God's call to worship, transcending social, economic, and cultural distinctions. It reflects the biblical principle that God shows no partiality (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>) and values each individual equally, regardless of status. This inclusivity is a recurring theme in Revelation, where people from every nation, tribe, and language are gathered before God's throne (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). It underscores the universal scope of God's kingdom and the unity of believers in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_from_the_throne.htm">Voice from the Throne</a></b><br>This voice is a divine proclamation, possibly an angel or a representation of God's authority, calling for worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_god.htm">Servants of God</a></b><br>Refers to all believers who serve God, emphasizing their role in worship and reverence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_fear_him.htm">Those Who Fear Him</a></b><br>This includes all who hold God in reverence and awe, recognizing His power and majesty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/small_and_great.htm">Small and Great</a></b><br>Indicates the inclusivity of God's call to worship, transcending social, economic, and status boundaries.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/throne.htm">Throne</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's sovereign rule and authority over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_call_to_worship.htm">Universal Call to Worship</a></b><br>God's invitation to praise is extended to all, regardless of status or position.

We are not told whose voice it is. Some have assumed that it is Christ's: it is better to leave it indefinite. In response to the bidding, the voice of praise is heard (like the voice spoken of in <a href="/revelation/14-2.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:">Revelation 14:2</a>), as it were, the voice of a great multitude; and, as it were, the voice of many waters; and, as it were, the voice of mighty thunders. All nature's tones seem mingled in this voice of praise: it is human, it is majestic as the sea, and glorious as the thunder.<p>The Anthem.<p>Alleluia!<p>For the Lord reigned,<p>The God, the Almighty.<p>Let us rejoice and exult,<p>And we will give the glory to Him,<p>Because the marriage of the Lamb is come,<p>And His wife hath made herself ready.<p>In this anthem the word for "reigneth" is not in the present tense, as in the English version; but, though it is translated here "reigned," we must not understand it of the past only: it expresses the exultation of the servants of God that the Kingship of their God is manifested, and vindicated against those who denied, or hated His rule. His reign never ceased; and He has showed that His was a real sovereignty. Their joy rises also from the prospect of the nearer union between the Lamb and His Bride. This close union is more fully spoken of later: here the glorious close is for a moment anticipated: the morning glow announces the coming day: it is near even at the doors. The image of the marriage is familiar. It entered into our Lord's parable (<a href="/context/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2-10</a>; <a href="/context/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1-10</a>): we catch it in the Psalms and in the Epistles (Psalms 45, and <a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a voice came out of the throne, saying.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;</span> "out of," is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, P, 1, 34, etc.; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, "forth from," is supported by A, B, C, etc.; while B reads <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "heaven," instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "throne." Alford suggests that the direction rather than the source of the voice is intended. It is impossible to say to whom the voice should be attributed (cf. <a href="/revelation/10-4.htm">Revelation 10:4, 8</a>, etc.). As an invitation to the Church to praise God, we might expect the voice to be that of one of the elders. <span class="cmt_word">Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, omit the first "and," thus reading: "ye his servants, ye that fear him," etc. The first words are a repetition of the "Hallelujah" of ver. 1.
