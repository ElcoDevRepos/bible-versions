The four living creatures are introduced in <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6-8</a>, representing aspects of God's character and the created order. Their presence here underscores the divine origin of the message and its importance in the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>saying, &#8220;A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius</b><br>This part of the verse describes a situation of economic distress and scarcity. A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer in the Roman Empire, as seen in <a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>. The price mentioned here indicates severe inflation, where a full day's work would only provide enough wheat for one person or barley for a small family. Wheat and barley were staple foods, and their high cost suggests famine conditions, aligning with the third seal's theme of scarcity and hardship.<p><b>and do not harm the oil and wine.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction to not harm the oil and wine suggests a partial limitation on the famine's effects. Oil and wine were considered luxury items in the ancient world, often associated with wealth and abundance. This could imply that while basic necessities become scarce, luxury goods remain available, highlighting social inequality. Alternatively, it may indicate God's mercy in preserving some resources. This phrase can also be seen as a reminder of God's control over the events, ensuring that the devastation is not total.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_living_creatures.htm">Four Living Creatures</a></b><br>These are heavenly beings that surround the throne of God, often associated with the cherubim described in Ezekiel and the seraphim in Isaiah.

A full day&#8217;s wage buys only a day&#8217;s food, forcing desperate rationing, yet God intentionally spares oil and wine to show His sovereign control and the progressive nature of judgment. This verse reminds believers that Scripture&#8217;s prophecies unfold literally, that the Lord both disciplines and protects, and that ultimate hope rests in the Lamb who opens the seals and will soon set all things right (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5-10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say;</span> <span class="accented">I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying</span> (Revised Version). The speaker is not perceived by St. John; the words proceed from somewhere near the throne (but the exact situation is left doubtful), which is surrounded by the four living creatures (see on Revelation 4:6 for the consideration both of the position and of the nature of the four living creatures). Alford points out the appropriateness of the voice proceeding from the midst of the representatives of creation, when the intent of the words is to mitigate the woes denounced against creation. Those who consider the living creatures to be symbolical of the Gospels, and who interpret this vision as a prophecy of heresy (see on ver. 5), also see an appropriateness in the fact of the voice issuing from amidst the living creatures, since by the power and influence of the Gospels heresy is dispelled. Wordsworth recalls the custom of placing the Gospels in the midst of the Synod in the ancient Councils of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny;</span> <span class="accented">a choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius.</span> The <span class="accented">choenix</span> appears to have been the food allotted to one man for a day; while the <span class="accented">denarius</span> was the pay of a soldier or of a common labourer for one day (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>, "He agreed with the labourers for a penny a day," and Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 1:17, 26, "Ut denarius diurnum stipendium foret." Cf. Tobit 5:14, where <span class="accented">drachma</span> is equivalent to <span class="accented">denarius</span>). The choenix was the eighth part of the modius, and a denarius would usually purchase a modius of wheat. The price given, therefore, denotes great scarcity, though not an entire absence of food, since a man's wages would barely suffice to obtain him food. Barley, which was the coarser food, was obtainable at one third of the price, which would allow a man to feed a family, though with difficulty. A season of great scarcity is therefore predicted, though in his wrath God remembers mercy (cf. the judgments threatened in <a href="/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>, viz. the sword, pestilence, and famine; also the expression, "They shall deliver you your bread again by weight"). <span class="cmt_word">And see thou hurt net the oil and the wine.</span> The corollary to the preceding sentence, with the same signification. It expresses a limit set to the power of the rider on the black horse. These were typical articles of food (cf. <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14, 15</a>, "That he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart;" and <a href="/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>, "The corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth"). Wordsworth interprets, "The prohibition to the rider, 'Hurt not thou the oil and the wine,' is a restraint on the evil design of the rider, who would injure the spiritual oil and wine, that is, the means of grace, which had been typified under those symbols in ancient prophecy (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4, 5</a>), and also by the words and acts of Christ, the good Samaritan, pouring in oil and wine into the wounds of the traveller, representing human nature, lying in the road." '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the Revelation invariably signifies "to injure," and, except in one case, takes the direct accusative after it (see <a href="/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2, 3</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4, 10, 19</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a>). Nevertheless, Heinrich and Elliott render, "Do not commit injustice in the matter of the oil and wine." Rinek renders, "waste not." The vision is a general prophecy of the future for all time (see on ver. 5); but many writers have striven to identify the fulfilment of the vision with some one particular famine. Grotius and Wetstein refer it to the scarcity in the days of Claudius; Renan, to that in the time of Nero; Bishop Newton, to the end of the second century. Those who interpret the vision as a forewarning of the spread of heresy, especially single out that of Arius. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
