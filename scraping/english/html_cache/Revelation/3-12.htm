In the context of Revelation, overcoming is a recurring theme, emphasizing perseverance through trials and temptations. It echoes the promises made to the seven churches in <a href="/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2-3</a>, where each church is encouraged to overcome specific challenges. The concept of overcoming is rooted in the victory of Christ over sin and death, as seen in <a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>.<p><b>I will make a pillar in the temple of My God</b><br>A pillar symbolizes strength, stability, and permanence. In ancient architecture, pillars were essential for supporting structures, and they often represented honor and status. This promise suggests that the overcomer will have a permanent place in God's presence, signifying eternal security and honor. The imagery of a temple connects to the Old Testament, where the temple was the dwelling place of God among His people (<a href="/1_kings/6.htm">1 Kings 6:1-38</a>). In the New Testament, believers are described as the temple of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>), indicating a spiritual fulfillment.<p><b>and he will never again leave it</b><br>This assurance of permanence contrasts with the instability and transience of earthly life. It reflects the eternal security and unbroken fellowship with God that believers will experience in the new creation. The promise of never leaving God's presence is a reversal of the exile and separation caused by sin, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>.<p><b>Upon him I will write the name of My God</b><br>Writing God's name on the believer signifies ownership, identity, and belonging. In biblical times, names held significant meaning and often represented character and authority. This act of inscribing God's name indicates a deep, personal relationship with the divine. It parallels the high priest's garments in <a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>, where God's name was inscribed, symbolizing holiness and dedication.<p><b>and the name of the city of My God (the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from My God)</b><br>The new Jerusalem represents the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises, a restored and perfect dwelling place for His people. This imagery is drawn from prophetic visions in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17-19</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, where a renewed city signifies God's presence and blessing. The descent from heaven emphasizes its divine origin and contrasts with earthly cities marked by sin and corruption. <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-4</a> further describes the new Jerusalem as a place of eternal joy and communion with God.<p><b>and My new name</b><br>The new name signifies a fresh revelation of Christ's character and authority. In biblical tradition, a new name often accompanies a new identity or mission, as seen with Abram becoming Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) and Jacob becoming Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This promise suggests a deeper understanding and relationship with Christ in the eschatological future, reflecting the transformative power of His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_overcomer.htm">The Overcomer</a></b><br>Refers to believers who remain faithful and victorious in their faith, overcoming trials and temptations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_my_god.htm">The Temple of My God</a></b><br>Symbolizes the presence and dwelling place of God, representing eternal security and fellowship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_jerusalem.htm">The New Jerusalem</a></b><br>The heavenly city that represents the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises, a place of eternal peace and communion with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_god.htm">My God</a></b><br>Refers to God the Father, emphasizing the relationship between Jesus and the Father.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/my_new_name.htm">My New Name</a></b><br>Indicates a deeper revelation of Jesus' identity and authority, which will be fully revealed in the eschatological future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_faith.htm">Perseverance in Faith</a></b><br>The promise to the overcomer highlights the importance of steadfastness in faith amidst trials.

There may be reference to the frequent earthquakes which had shaken down buildings in their city. Those who overcome will prove real supports to the great Christian temple. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Write upon him.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">grave upon it.</span> On the sides of the four marble pillars which survive as ruins of Philadelphia inscriptions are to be found. The writing would be the name of God, the name of the heavenly Jerusalem and (omit the repetition, "I will write upon him") the new, unknown name of Christ Himself. The allusion is to the golden frontlet inscribed with the name of Jehovah. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>.) He will reflect the likeness of God; and not only so, he will bear the tokens--now seen in all clearness--of his heavenly citizenship (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22-23</a>). And a further promise implies that in the day of the last triumph, as there will be new revealings of Christ's power, there will be unfolded to the faithful and victorious new and higher possibilities of purity. Thus does Scripture refuse to recognise any finality which is not a beginning as well as an end--a landing-stage in the great law of continuity. (See <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Him that overcometh will I make a pillar. (For construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, see on Revelation 2:26.) The "overcoming" is a present continuous process, but will have a termination, and then he who has faithfully fought the daily battle will be made <span class="accented">a pillar</span>, steadfast, immovable. St. John may be alluding to <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the two pillars of Solomon's temple set up in the porch, and called <span class="accented">Jachin</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> he will establish) and <span class="accented">Boaz</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e5;</span>, in him is strength); see <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15, 21</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>. Both names signify steadfastness and permanence, and would serve to render emphatic the superiority in these respects of the reward to come when compared with the evanescent nature of present suffering. <span class="accented">A pillar is</span> constantly used as a figure of strength and durability (see <a href="/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A contrast may be intended between the immovableness of the Christian's future position and the liability of pillars in the Philadelphian temples to succumb to the effects of the frequent earthquakes which took place there (see on ver. 7). Such pillars, moreover, were frequently sculptured in human shape. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Matthew Henry suggests that a reference <span class="accented">may</span> be intended to monumental pillars bearing inscriptions; the signification being "a monumental pillar of the free and powerful grace of God, never to be defaced or removed; not a support - heaven needing no such props." But it <span class="accented">seems</span> much more likely that St. John is alluding to the Hebrew temple. In the temple. The <span class="accented">temple</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the shrine, the dwelling place of God, not <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, the whole extent of the sacred buildings. The latter word occurs often in St. John's Gospel, but never in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">temple</span> in the Revelation is the abode of God, the sacred shrine into which all may be privileged to enter, both in this world and in the world to come. Of my God (see note on Revelation 3:2; 2:7). And he shall go no more out. "And out of it he shall in no wise go out more:" such is the full force of the Greek. The conqueror's period of probation will be over, and he shall be for ever free from the possibility of falling away. Trench quotes St. Augustine: "Quis non desideret illam civi-tatem, unde amicus non exit, quo inimicus non intrat?" And I will write upon him the name of my God (cf. <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>, "His name shall be in their foreheads;" and <a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "Those which have not the seal of God in their foreheads;" the former passage referring to the elect in heaven, the latter distinguishing Christians on earth from their heathen oppressors). In the passage under consideration the action is future; it does not refer to holy baptism, but to the sealing of the faithful upon their entrance into glory - a sealing which shall settle for ever, and make all things sure. "To write the name upon" anything is a common figurative expression in Hebrew to denote taking absolute possession of, and making completely one's own. Thus Joab fears that Rabbah may be called after his name, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> looked upon as his, if David should be absent at the capture of it (<a href="/2_samuel/12-28.htm">2 Samuel 12:28</a>; cf. also <a href="/numbers/6-27.htm">Numbers 6:27</a>). The struggling Christian is encouraged by hearing that a time will come when he will without any doubt become God's own, incapable of being removed or claimed by other. In the rabbinical book, 'Bava Bathra,' 75. 2, it is noted that there are three applications of the name of God:  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The [one who]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(HO)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
