The "angel" signifies a divine messenger executing God's judgment. The "throne of the beast" symbolizes the center of power for the Antichrist, a figure representing ultimate opposition to God. This imagery connects to the plagues in Egypt, where God's judgments were poured out on Pharaoh's kingdom. The "beast" is often associated with the Roman Empire in historical context, but also represents any oppressive regime opposing God's will.<p><b>and its kingdom was plunged into darkness</b><br>Darkness is a recurring biblical motif representing judgment and separation from God. This darkness parallels the ninth plague of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>), where physical darkness symbolized spiritual blindness and divine judgment. The "kingdom" here refers to the realm under the beast's control, indicating a complete disruption of its power and influence. This darkness can also be seen as a type of Christ's crucifixion, where darkness covered the land, symbolizing the judgment of sin.<p><b>and men began to gnaw their tongues in anguish</b><br>This vivid imagery conveys extreme suffering and distress. The act of gnawing one's tongue suggests intense pain and regret, reminiscent of the torment described in <a href="/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>, where the rich man in Hades experiences unrelenting agony. This suffering is a direct result of the divine judgment poured out, highlighting the consequences of rebellion against God.

In doing so, God displays His absolute sovereignty, exposes the beast&#8217;s frailty, and foreshadows the eternal fate of all who reject the light of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And the fifth . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne</span> (not "the seat:" see Notes on <a href="/revelation/4-10.htm" title="The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that lives for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,">Revelation 4:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>) <span class= "ital">of the wild beast.</span> The vials of judgment gradually dissolve the integrity and organisation of the kingdom of the wild beast. The result of the principles on which it has been based begin to show themselves: first, moral disease in individuals; then a corrupt tone of national morals spreading into the higher orders of society; then the fierce pride of vaunted light which scorches. Where these are, disorganisation is not far off; evil goes out a murderer and comes home a suicide. The retribution comes home; the throne of the world-power, the very head and centre of its authority, is smitten.<p><span class= "bld">And his kingdom was full of darkness.</span>--<span class= "ital">And his kingdom was darkened.</span> We have the counterpart of the Egyptian plague (<a href="/context/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21-23</a>); there was a typical force in that ancient plague: the kingdom which boasted itself so full of light becomes darkened. When men shut out the higher light, the smoke of their own candles will soon obscure the whole heaven. When moral evil is linked with intellectual light, the moral evil will be found the stronger; for we cannot have a sunbeam without the sun. "Take heed," said Christ, "that the light that is in thee be not darkness." There is a light that is darkness; the progress of evil bringing about its own retribution proves this conclusively.<p>(10, 11) But even the failure of their own light does not work repentance: <span class= "ital">they gnawed their tongues from their pain.</span> Here is remorse and suffering. They are "unto themselves" (as the Book of Wisdom describes the Egyptians) "more grievous than the darkness" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/17-21.htm" title="Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of that darkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.">Wisdom Of Solomon 17:21</a>); but there is no softening or humbling of themselves, no turning to God. They still love what God hates, and hate what He loves, for they blasphemed God, &c., <span class= "ital">and repented not of their works.</span> Such is the wretched state of the world-power in the day when retributive evil overtakes it--darkness, pain, and inability to repent. Is it not a picture of the ultimate state of all sin? It is not a vast world-power alone which exhibits pain and confusion like this. It is to be seen over and over again in men and nations. The power of evil comes home and robs men of their accustomed guides. They are brought into darkness and trouble; the throne where the master-power of worldliness sat is cast down; the evil passion which was the unifying power of their life is deprived of the field of its power; then follows exasperation, anger at defeat, readiness to accuse others, but no blame of self, no repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast.</span> Omit "angel" as before (see on ver. 8). <span class="accented">The throne of the beast.</span> That throne which had been given to him by the dragon (<a href="/revelation/13-2.htm">Revelation 13:2</a>), and which here typifies the centre and source of his power.

The darkness is a type of the spiritual darkness which prevails among the subjects of the beast, and which they themselves frequently realize in the course of their career.
