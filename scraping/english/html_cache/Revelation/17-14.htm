The imagery of war is symbolic of the spiritual and moral conflict between good and evil. The Lamb is a title for Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the sacrificial Savior. This conflict is part of the larger narrative of Revelation, where the forces of darkness are ultimately defeated. The concept of making war against God is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed.<p><b>and the Lamb will triumph over them</b><br>The triumph of the Lamb signifies the ultimate victory of Christ over all evil. This victory is assured and reflects the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. The Lamb's triumph is not through conventional warfare but through His sacrificial death and resurrection, which defeated sin and death. This victory is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>, where believers are reminded that victory comes through Jesus Christ.<p><b>because He is Lord of lords and King of kings</b><br>This title emphasizes the supreme authority and sovereignty of Jesus Christ over all earthly and spiritual powers. It is a declaration of His divine nature and His ultimate rule over all creation. The title "Lord of lords and King of kings" is also found in <a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, underscoring the consistent biblical theme of Christ's preeminence.<p><b>and He will be accompanied by His called and chosen and faithful ones.</b><br>This phrase highlights the participation of believers in Christ's victory. The "called" refers to those who have responded to God's invitation to salvation. The "chosen" indicates God's sovereign election, and the "faithful" describes those who remain steadfast in their faith. This group represents the Church, the body of believers who are united with Christ in His triumph. The concept of being called, chosen, and faithful is seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-30</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, which speak to the identity and mission of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the sacrificial Lamb, a central figure in Christian theology symbolizing redemption and victory over sin and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adversaries.htm">The Adversaries</a></b><br>These are the forces aligned against the Lamb, often interpreted as the beast and the kings of the earth who oppose Christ's reign.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_called,_chosen,_and_faithful.htm">The Called, Chosen, and Faithful</a></b><br>These are the followers of Christ, believers who are called by God, chosen for His purposes, and remain faithful to Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_war.htm">The War</a></b><br>Symbolizes the spiritual and eschatological conflict between the forces of good (Christ and His followers) and evil (the beast and its allies).<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/lord_of_lords_and_king_of_kings.htm">Lord of lords and King of kings</a></b><br>Titles affirming the supreme authority and sovereignty of Jesus Christ over all earthly and spiritual powers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_ultimate_victory.htm">Christ's Ultimate Victory</a></b><br>Jesus, as the Lamb, will triumph over all opposition.

This war between the Lamb and the powers of evil is that which extends throughout the history of the world (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>); it occupies the "one hour" of ver. 12, which is equivalent to the period of the world's existence.

Another evidence of the lifelong nature of this war. Not only Christ wars and overcomes, but those associated with him are permitted to share in the battle and the victory. Christ's saints are <span class="accented">called</span> here to battle; in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> they are <span class="accented">called</span> to the marriage supper of the Lamb (cf. also the exhortation to <span class="accented">faithfulness</span> in <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). The three epithets describe the progressive life of those who share Christ's victory They are <span class="accented">called</span> - as all men are - to serve him; having heard the call, they dedicate their lives to his service, and become his <span class="accented">chosen</span> servants; finally, having remained <span class="accented">faithful</span> to him, they share in his victory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[They]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">will make war</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#949;&#956;&#942;&#963;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(polem&#275;sousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4170.htm">Strong's 4170: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make war, contend, fight, battle.
