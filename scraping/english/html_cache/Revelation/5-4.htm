This emotional response highlights the gravity of the situation. In the biblical context, weeping often signifies profound grief or despair, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9:1</a> and <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>. John's weeping underscores the importance of the scroll and the need for someone worthy to open it. The intensity of his weeping suggests the critical nature of the revelation contained within the scroll, which pertains to God's ultimate plan for redemption and judgment.<p><b>because no one was found worthy</b><br>The search for someone worthy emphasizes the holiness and righteousness required to open the scroll. Worthiness here implies moral and spiritual perfection, qualities that align with divine standards. This reflects the biblical theme of human inadequacy and the need for a savior, as seen in <a href="/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-12</a>. The phrase also points to the uniqueness of Christ, who alone is worthy, as later revealed in <a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5-6</a>. This moment highlights the anticipation and expectation for the one who can fulfill God's redemptive plan.<p><b>to open the scroll or look inside it</b><br>The scroll represents God's decrees and the unfolding of future events, possibly containing judgments, blessings, and the ultimate fulfillment of prophecy. In ancient times, scrolls were used for important documents, and sealed scrolls indicated confidentiality and authority. The inability to open or even look inside the scroll signifies the limitations of creation in understanding or executing God's sovereign will. This connects to <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, where a sealed scroll is mentioned, and emphasizes the need for divine intervention to reveal and enact God's purposes. The scroll's contents are crucial for the consummation of history and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who is experiencing this vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.

No creature qualifies, underscoring universal sinfulness and the holiness of God&#8217;s purposes. The unopened scroll represents postponed judgment and delayed restoration. <a href="/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a> therefore builds dramatic tension that finds joyful resolution in the immediate context when the Lion-Lamb, Jesus Christ, alone proves worthy to open the scroll, securing history&#8217;s completion and creation&#8217;s redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And I wept much, because no man (better, no one) was found worthy to open . . . the book (omit, "and to read").</span>--The Apostle is not ashamed to call attention to his tears. I, indeed, for my part (the "I" is emphatic) wept much. It was not a failure of faith; it was the outburst of an earnest heart, to which the knowledge of God and the destinies of his fellowmen were very dear. Those who have longed to see the end of oppression, fraud, and sorrow on the earth, to know something of the laws which govern the present, and of their issue in the future, will understand these tears.
