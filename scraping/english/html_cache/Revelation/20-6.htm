In biblical context, "blessed" often denotes a state of divine favor and happiness. "Holy" signifies being set apart for God's purposes. The first resurrection refers to the rising of believers who have died, as described in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>, where the dead in Christ rise first. This resurrection is distinct from the general resurrection of the dead and is associated with the reward of eternal life. The concept of resurrection is central to Christian eschatology, emphasizing victory over death through Christ.<p><b>The second death has no power over them,</b><br>The "second death" is a term used in Revelation to describe eternal separation from God, often associated with the lake of fire (<a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>). For those who partake in the first resurrection, this second death holds no threat, signifying their eternal security and salvation. This assurance is rooted in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who conquered death and offers eternal life to believers (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).<p><b>but they will be priests of God and of Christ</b><br>This phrase indicates a role of service and worship. In the Old Testament, priests were mediators between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers. In the New Testament, all believers are considered a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), suggesting direct access to God through Christ. This priestly role in the millennial kingdom involves serving God and Christ, reflecting the believer's sanctified status and purpose.<p><b>and will reign with Him for a thousand years.</b><br>The thousand-year reign, often referred to as the Millennium, is a period of Christ's rule on earth, as described in <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-6</a>. This reign is characterized by peace and righteousness, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>. Believers reigning with Christ signifies their participation in His authority and governance, a promise of reward for faithfulness (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>).

The blessing on those who have part or share in the first resurrection has this definite feature. On these the second death has not power (or authority). The second death stands in contrast with the first resurrection. The second death is not the mere physical dying; it is rather that more awful death which lies outside the region of the things seen and temporal. Whatever it means, and whatever the conditions which surround it, it is spiritual rather than physical. It is not the life of the body which protects the life of the spirit; it is the living and believing in God which protects from the second death; according to Christ's word of such, "they shall never die" (<a href="/john/11-26.htm" title="And whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believe you this?">John 11:26</a>; comp. <a href="/context/john/10-27.htm" title="My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:">John 10:27-28</a>). Blessed, too, are such in being priests and kings (they shall reign). Theirs is the priesthood of life who have offered themselves a living sacrifice to God (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>). The kingship of life is theirs, who have overcome the world-powers in the word of God and in the blood of the Lamb; these truly reign. (Comp. Note on <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm" title="And have made us to our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.">Revelation 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years;</span> <span class="accented">over these the second death hath no authority.</span> The first words describe the state of those who have part in the spiritual resurrection with Christ (see on ver. 5).

We may in this place briefly indicate some of the other interpretations which have been given to this reign cf. the saints for a thousand years, or, as it is generally styled, the millennium. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The literal interpretation of a future reign on earth of Christ with his saints for a thousand years. According to this view, there is to be a first resurrection of the dead (either of the holy dead or of all the dead), then the period of a thousand years, during which Satan will be bound, and the saints will reign; then finally the ultimate punishment of Satan - the casting into the lake of fire. Some limit the locality of this reign to a particular spot on the earth (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerusalem), beyond which live the ungodly. The objections to this theory are: <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> Amongst its advocates almost every detail is a matter of dispute. Some place the millennium in the future, others in the past. Of these latter some specify the first thousand years of the Christian age, others the thousand years from the time of Constantine. "The length of the period, the number and class of the believers who shall be partakers of its glory, the condition in which they are to live, the work in which they are to be engaged, the relation in which the exalted Redeemer is to stand to them," are all subjects for disagreement. <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The carnal nature of such a resurrection is at variance with the general teaching of the Bible, and unlike the spiritual nature which our Lord himself assumed after his resurrection.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Blessed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(makarios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3107.htm">Strong's 3107: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happy, blessed, to be envied.
