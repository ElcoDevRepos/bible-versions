This timeframe echoes the three and a half years (42 months) mentioned elsewhere in Revelation, which is associated with tribulation and persecution. It also parallels the ministry of Jesus, who was in the tomb for three days, suggesting a period of apparent defeat before victory.<p><b>all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of the event, indicating that the entire world will witness it. It reflects the global nature of the end times, as seen in other parts of Revelation where similar language is used to describe the reach of the gospel and the extent of God's judgment. This universality underscores the significance of the event and the widespread impact it will have.<p><b>will view their bodies</b><br>The public display of the bodies signifies humiliation and disgrace, as leaving bodies unburied was considered a great dishonor in ancient cultures. This act of viewing also suggests a level of technological advancement or communication that allows people from all over the world to witness the event simultaneously, which aligns with modern capabilities.<p><b>and will not permit them to be laid in a tomb</b><br>Refusing burial is a sign of contempt and rejection, highlighting the world's animosity towards the witnesses. In biblical times, burial was a sacred duty, and denying it was a severe insult. This act of disrespect reflects the spiritual blindness and rebellion of the people against God's messengers, reminiscent of the treatment of prophets and righteous individuals throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_witnesses.htm">Two Witnesses</a></b><br>Central figures in <a href="/bsb/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>, these witnesses prophesy for 1,260 days and are eventually killed by the beast.

The episode showcases human rebellion and God&#8217;s sovereign timetable. By allowing this brief humiliation, the Lord sets the stage for a resurrection that will jolt the watching nations and vindicate His servants, reminding believers that every second of history remains firmly in His hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves</span>; <span class="accented">and from among the peoples and tribes</span>, etc., <span class="accented">do</span> [men] <span class="accented">look upon</span>, etc., <span class="accented">and suffer not</span>, etc., <span class="accented">in a tomb</span> (Revised Version). The fourfold enumeration points to the wide distribution of the state of things symbolized (cf. <a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, etc.), and seems of itself almost sufficient to demonstrate that the two witnesses are not two individual persons who are hereafter to appear. The period is but three days and a half; again, as in vers. 2, 3, a broken, that is, a finite but uncertain period; but, as compared with the three years and a half - the period of the world's existence - very short. (On the signification of the last clause, see on ver. 8.) It is the usual Eastern mark of contempt and degradation. The whole verse, together with the preceding and succeeding verses, describes symbolically, but graphically, the scorn and contempt to which the Church and God's Word will be subjected by men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For three</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(treis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5140.htm">Strong's 5140: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three.
