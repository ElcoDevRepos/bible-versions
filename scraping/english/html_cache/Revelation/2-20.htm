It follows a pattern seen in the letters to the seven churches in Revelation, where commendation is often followed by correction. The phrase underscores the seriousness of the issue at hand, highlighting the need for repentance and correction within the church.<p><b>You tolerate that woman Jezebel:</b><br>The reference to "Jezebel" is symbolic, drawing from the Old Testament figure, Queen Jezebel, wife of King Ahab, known for leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>). The use of her name suggests the presence of a similar corrupting influence within the church. Tolerance here implies a failure to confront and remove false teachings and immoral practices, which is a significant issue in maintaining the purity of the church.<p><b>who calls herself a prophetess:</b><br>This indicates that the woman in question claimed spiritual authority and insight, positioning herself as a leader or teacher within the church. The self-designation as a prophetess suggests a false claim to divine revelation, contrasting with true prophets who are called by God. This self-appointment is a warning against accepting spiritual authority without discernment.<p><b>By her teaching she misleads My servants:</b><br>The phrase highlights the impact of false teaching on the believers, leading them astray from the truth. The term "My servants" emphasizes the personal relationship between Jesus and His followers, and the gravity of leading them into error. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the danger of false prophets and teachers (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>, <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>).<p><b>to be sexually immoral and to eat food sacrificed to idols:</b><br>These specific sins were prevalent in the Greco-Roman world, often associated with pagan worship practices. Sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols were explicitly condemned in the early church (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</a>).

He commends what is good, yet He will not ignore what is evil. As <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a> says, &#8220;For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God.&#8221; The Lord&#8217;s rebuke proves His love (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). We cannot cling to past faithfulness while excusing present compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You tolerate that woman Jezebel</b><p>The believers in Thyatira were not actively promoting error; they were tolerating it. Tolerance sounds kind, yet Jesus calls it sin when it excuses what He condemns. Old-Testament Jezebel led Israel into Baal worship and immorality (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>; 18:19). Likewise, this New-Testament &#8220;Jezebel&#8221; was seducing a church that should have driven her out (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>: &#8220;Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who calls herself a prophetess</b><p>She claimed Spirit-given authority, but the Lord never sent her. <a href="/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21</a> warns, &#8220;I did not send these prophets, yet they ran.&#8221; <a href="/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a> urges, &#8220;Test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.&#8221; Self-promotion in spiritual things is a red flag; true servants are recognized by conformity to God&#8217;s Word and the fruit of righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By her teaching she misleads My servants</b><p>The danger is not merely a wrong opinion; it is the corruption of &#8220;My servants,&#8221; people who belong to Christ. <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a> forewarns of wolves who &#8220;will arise and distort the truth.&#8221; Error dressed up as revelation is especially seductive. Jesus holds both the deceiver and the deceived accountable, yet He shines light so His flock may turn back (<a href="/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To be sexually immoral</b><p>In Thyatira&#8217;s trade-guild culture, pagan feasts often ended in immorality. Jezebel&#8217;s teaching made participation seem spiritually permissible. But Scripture is plain: &#8220;This is the will of God&#8212;your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>). &#8220;Flee sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), not flirt with it. Truth guards purity; error unchains passion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And to eat food sacrificed to idols</b><p>Idolatrous meals were more than casual dinners; they honored demons (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19-21</a>). <a href="/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a> had already told Gentile believers to &#8220;abstain from food sacrificed to idols.&#8221; Jezebel blurred that line, perhaps arguing for cultural relevance or economic necessity. Yet the first commandment still stands (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Compromise at the table of idols is fellowship with darkness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a> exposes the deadly mix of false teaching, immoral practice, and passive tolerance. Jesus calls His church to confront error, protect holiness, and worship Him alone. Where love and faith once flourished, they must be guarded by truth and courage, for the purity of the bride matters to the Bridegroom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">A few things.</span>--The Sinaitic MS. has "I have much against thee; but the reading, <span class= "ital">I have against thee that thou lettest alone, </span>&c., is to be preferred.<p><span class= "bld">Jezebel.</span>--Some adopt the reading, "thy wife Jezebel." From these words it has been thought that there was some personal influence at work for evil in Thyatira. Whether in the household of the "angel" or not is at least doubtful. The sin alleged against her is the same for which the Nicolaitanes are condemned--fornication, and the eating of things sacrificed to idols. If the above view be right, the leader of the exorcists is a woman--regarded by her followers as a prophetess, as one with a real message from God; but viewed by the Lord of the churches as a very Jezebel, teaching and seducing the servants of God. For letting her alone, for being timid, paying too much deference to her spiritual pretensions, for failing to see and to show that the so-called "deep things" of these teachers were depths of Satan, the chief minister is rebuked. A large number of respectable critics regard Jezebel as a name applied to a faction, not as belonging to an individual. It seems best to view the name as symbolical, always remembering that the Jezebel spirit of proud, self-constituted authority, vaunting claims of superior holiness, or higher knowledge, linked with a disregard of--and perhaps a proud contempt for--"legalism," and followed by open immorality, has again and again run riot in the churches of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I have against thee that thou sufferest</span>. This is certainly fight. "A few things" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) is an insertion in some inferior authorities. Others insert "many things" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>); the Sinaitic inserts "much" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>); while the best authorities have nothing between <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>; and then <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> must be rendered "that" rather than "because." The construction is the same as in ver. 4. There is a right and a wrong suffering; and the Church in Thyatira exhibits both. The enduring of tribulation (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is commended; the toleration of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) is rebuked. It is not said that Jezebel receives sympathy or encouragement, but merely that she is let alone; her wickedness is left unchecked, and that is sinful. For this use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, comp. <a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>; <a href="/john/12-7.htm">John 12:7</a>.

But even if "thy wife" be preferred, there is no need to understand Jezebel as indicating a distinct person. We are in the region of figures and metaphors. Perhaps all that is indicated is that the angel of the Church at Thyatira is suffering from the tolerated presence of a baneful influence, as did Ahab, "whom <span class="accented">Jezebel his wife</span> stirred up" (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). And if it is not certain that any individual false prophetess is signified, it is scarcely worth while to speculate as to who this individual is. Jezebel may be a person, or she may be a form of false doctrine personified. If the former, Jezebel is doubtless not her real name, but a symbolical name of reproach, and what her name and status were we have no means of knowing. In any case the error represented by the name is closely akin to that of the Nicolaitans and to "the doctrine of Balaam." Whatever differences of detail there may have been, all three made Christian liberty a plea for an antichristian licence which claimed to be above the moral Law. And she teacheth and seduceth. This is an independent statement, and must not, as in the Authorized Version, be made to depend upon "thou sufferest." For the construction <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). The word for "seduce," or "lead astray" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>), in the active is frequent in St. John, especially in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a> 13:14; 19:20; 20:3, 8, 10; <a href="/john/7-12.htm">John 7:12</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-26.htm">1 John 2:26</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). A comparison of these passages will lead to the conclusion that the word implies seduction into error of a very grave kind. It is not clear whether "fornication" is to be understood literally, or, as often in the Old Testament, in the spiritual sense of idolatry. The former seems more probable. "My servants" means all Christians, as is clear from <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a> and Revelation 22:3; it must not be limited to those in authority in the Church.
