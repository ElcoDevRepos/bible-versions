"The idea that the Shechinah, the <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>; (<span class= "ital">skene</span>), the glory which betokened the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies, and which was wanting to the sacred temple, would be restored once more in Messiah's days was a cherished hope of the Jewish doctors during and after the Apostolic ages."

God's tabernacle shall be with them (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm" title="And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.">Revelation 21:3</a>), and with them so as to stretch over them: He will tabernacle over (or, <span class= "ital">upon)</span> them. With this we may compare St. Paul's expression in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9</a> ("that the power of Christ may tabernacle" --"rest" in the English version--"upon me"), where Professor Lightfoot (whose words have just been quoted) thinks that there is a similar reference to the symbol of the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/4-5.htm" title="And the LORD will create on every dwelling place of mount Zion, and on her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for on all the glory shall be a defense.">Isaiah 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-27.htm" title="My tabernacle also shall be with them: yes, I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Ezekiel 37:27</a>; and <a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>.) There seems also to be a carrying on of the imagery derived from the Feast of Tabernacles: as there were the palm branches of the harvest joy, so there will be the booth, or tabernacle, of God's presence among them. He shall be their pavilion, their shelter. "There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from the heat, and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore are they before the throne of God.</span> That is, because they have been washed, and have their robes made white, they are before the throne (cf. <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>, "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it,... that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And serve him day and night in his temple.</span> As described in <a href="/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8, 11</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8-14</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>, etc. <span class="accented">Temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is here, as in <a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, the "dwelling place, the shrine, of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> heaven.
