The Spirit's role is to guide, comfort, and convict believers, while the bride represents the collective body of believers. The invitation to "Come" is a call to salvation and fellowship with God, echoing the open invitation of the Gospel. This reflects the eschatological hope and the longing for Christ's return, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>, where the marriage of the Lamb is celebrated.<p><b>Let the one who hears say, &#8220;Come!&#8221;</b><br>This part emphasizes the responsibility of those who have heard the Gospel to also extend the invitation to others. It underscores the participatory role of believers in evangelism and the spread of the Gospel message. The call to "Come" is not just for the initial hearers but is meant to be passed on, creating a chain of invitation that spans generations. This aligns with the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to make disciples of all nations.<p><b>And let the one who is thirsty come,</b><br>The imagery of thirst is a powerful metaphor for spiritual longing and need. In the biblical context, thirst often symbolizes a deep desire for God and His righteousness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>. This invitation is inclusive, extending to anyone who recognizes their spiritual need. It reflects the promise of satisfaction and fulfillment found in Christ, who offers living water, as He did to the Samaritan woman in <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>.<p><b>and the one who desires the water of life drink freely.</b><br>The "water of life" is a symbol of eternal life and the sustenance that comes from a relationship with God. This phrase assures that the gift of salvation is available without cost, emphasizing the grace of God. The concept of drinking freely points to the abundance and accessibility of God's provision for those who seek Him. This is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, where the invitation to come and drink is extended to all who are thirsty, highlighting the generosity and inclusivity of God's offer of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, who is active in the world, drawing people to Christ and empowering believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Church, the collective body of believers in Jesus Christ, who eagerly await His return and invite others to join in the salvation offered by Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_hears.htm">The One Who Hears</a></b><br>Represents individuals who have heard the message of the Gospel and are encouraged to respond to the invitation to come to Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thirsty.htm">The Thirsty</a></b><br>Symbolizes those who recognize their spiritual need and longing for the fulfillment that only Christ can provide.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_water_of_life.htm">The Water of Life</a></b><br>Represents the eternal life and satisfaction found in Jesus Christ, freely offered to all who come to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universal_invitation.htm">The Universal Invitation</a></b><br>The call to "Come!" is extended to all, emphasizing the inclusivity of the Gospel.

We may draw near to Him, who is drawing near to us: <span class= "ital">let him that thirsteth, come; let him that will take the water of life freely.</span> (Comp. <a href="/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.) "The power of the whole gospel," says Bengel, "concentrates itself in this, that one should be able to respond to this Come, and repeat it from the heart."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.</span> These words are best understood as uttered by the writer. The Holy Spirit working in the Church, through whom she is bound to Christ as his bride, and the Church herself, eagerly welcome the fulfilment of Christ's promise made in ver. 12. (On "come," cf. <a href="/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And let him that heareth say, Come.</span> The Church in her corporate capacity welcomes her Lord; so, also, let each member in his individual capacity, who hears this "testimony" (ver. 16), be desirous of the advent of his Master. <span class="cmt_word">And let him that is athirst come;</span> <span class="accented">athirst</span> for the water of life (cf. <a href="/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>). And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Omit "and." Again the active participle indicates the voluntary nature of the action; though the living water be freely given without money and without price, it is not enforced upon any. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/22-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
