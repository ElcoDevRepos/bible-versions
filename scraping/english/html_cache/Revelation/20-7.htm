The "thousand years" is often interpreted as a literal or symbolic period of peace and righteousness where Christ reigns with His saints. This concept is rooted in Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, which describe a time of peace and harmony. The completion of this period signifies a transition in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>Satan will be released</b><br>The release of Satan indicates a temporary allowance for evil to once again test humanity. This release serves as a final demonstration of God's justice and the persistent nature of sin in the human heart. It echoes the testing of humanity seen in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3) and throughout biblical history. The release is part of God's sovereign plan, allowing for the ultimate defeat of evil.<p><b>from his prison</b><br>Satan's "prison" refers to the abyss where he was bound during the millennium (<a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>). This binding signifies God's control over evil and His ability to restrain it according to His purposes. The imagery of a prison underscores the temporary nature of Satan's confinement and the ultimate authority of God over all spiritual forces. This release sets the stage for the final confrontation between good and evil, leading to Satan's ultimate defeat and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The adversary of God and humanity, who is bound for a thousand years and then released to deceive the nations once more.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thousand_years.htm">The Thousand Years</a></b><br>Often referred to as the Millennium, a period of peace and righteousness where Christ reigns, and Satan is bound.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prison.htm">The Prison</a></b><br>Symbolic of the restraint placed on Satan during the Millennium, preventing him from deceiving the nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_millennium.htm">Understanding the Millennium</a></b><br>The thousand-year reign is a time of Christ's dominion and peace, a foretaste of the eternal kingdom.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s precise control over history, the unchangeable evil of the devil, and the necessity of personal faith even in ideal conditions. Ultimately, it sets the stage for Satan&#8217;s permanent defeat and the ushering in of the eternal state (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10-15</a>; 21:1-4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>THE LOOSING OF SATAN AND HIS FINAL OVERTHROW.</span><p>(7) <span class= "bld">And when the thousand years are expired.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">And when the thousand years have been finished.</span> The binding of Satan implied restraint put upon his power and freedom of action; the loosing means the removing of these restraints. The reign of Christ with His saints has been a witness to the power of our Master over the wicked one. This witness has been an opportunity also to the world. It was the earthly approximation to the ideal picture. It testified how completely "all power in heaven and in earth was given to Christ," and how there lay, therefore, within the reach of men the power of Him who would tread down their true enemies, and turn His hand against their adversaries (<a href="/context/psalms/81-13.htm" title="Oh that my people had listened to me, and Israel had walked in my ways!">Psalm 81:13-14</a>). But the time of opportunity must end. "O that Israel would have hearkened," is a cry that might have its counterpart over the history of earth's lost opportunities. Christendom is planted in the world to be a framework of regenerating power to mankind, just as the Law and its adjuncts were designed to be in Israel. But, as there the old idolatrous influences broke in upon the rule of God's covenant, so here do we find the vision picturing to us how Christendom will be invaded by the influences of the evil one, when mankind has let slip this splendid opportunity of a really golden age.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;</span> <span class="accented">are finished</span>; that is, the power of the devil having been in principle completely overthrown by our Lord (see on preceding verses), Satan is still permitted to wage war and exercise sway on the earth.
