The temple in heaven signifies the dwelling place of God, emphasizing the divine origin and authority of the angel. The imagery of the temple connects to the Old Testament, where the temple was the center of worship and God's presence among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The heavenly temple suggests a place of ultimate holiness and divine order, reinforcing the angel's role as a messenger of God's will.<p><b>and he too had a sharp sickle</b><br>The sharp sickle is a tool for harvesting, symbolizing judgment and the gathering of people for divine purposes. In the context of Revelation, the sickle represents the impending judgment and the separation of the righteous from the wicked. This imagery is consistent with the parables of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Weeds (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where the harvest signifies the end of the age and the final judgment. The presence of another angel with a sickle underscores the urgency and certainty of God's judgment, aligning with the prophetic themes throughout Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_angel.htm">Another Angel</a></b><br>This angel is distinct from the previous one mentioned in <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>.
