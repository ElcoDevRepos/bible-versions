The imagery of an iron scepter signifies unyielding authority and strength. In ancient times, a scepter was a symbol of royal power and governance. The use of "iron" emphasizes the firmness and invincibility of Christ's rule. This reflects the ultimate authority of Jesus over the nations, indicating a reign that is both just and powerful. The concept of ruling with an iron scepter also suggests the enforcement of divine justice and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.<p><b>and shatter them like pottery&#8212;</b><br>The imagery of shattering pottery signifies the complete and decisive judgment that will be executed upon those who oppose Christ's rule. In the ancient Near East, pottery was a common household item, easily broken and replaced, symbolizing the fragility of human power and rebellion against God. This phrase underscores the inevitability of divine judgment and the futility of resisting God's will. It echoes the prophetic language found in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>, where God declares the breaking of a nation like a potter's vessel. The shattering of pottery serves as a metaphor for the destruction of earthly kingdoms that stand against God's anointed.<p><b>just as I have received authority from My Father.</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine origin and legitimacy of Christ's authority. Jesus' authority is not self-assumed but granted by God the Father, affirming the unity and purpose within the Trinity. This echoes the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where Jesus declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of the promise in <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where God declares the installation of His King on Zion. It emphasizes the divine mandate and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ, who exercises His authority in accordance with the Father's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, who is addressing the church in Thyatira.

The Hebrew original, <span class="accented">trhm</span> without vowel points, may represent either <span class="accented">tirhem</span> or <span class="accented">terohem</span>; but the latter is required by what follows; "shalt dash them in pieces." Nevertheless, the gentler rendering better suits the requirements of these passages in the Apocalypse. The rule over the nations is to be strong, but it is to be loving also. To those who obey it, it will be a shepherding; only those who resist it will be dashed in pieces. Precisely the same expression is used in <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> of the Lamb shepherding his saints, and in <a href="/john/21-16.htm">John 21:16</a> in the charge to St. Peter to shepherd Christ's sheep.
