The imagery of "coming with the clouds" is deeply rooted in Old Testament prophecy, particularly in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, where the "Son of Man" is described as coming with the clouds of heaven. Clouds often symbolize divine presence and glory, as seen in the Exodus narrative where God led the Israelites by a pillar of cloud. This phrase assures believers of the majestic and undeniable nature of Christ's second coming.<p><b>and every eye will see Him</b><br>This statement underscores the universal visibility of Christ's return. Unlike His first coming, which was humble and largely unnoticed by the world, His second coming will be witnessed by all. This aligns with <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, where Jesus describes His return as visible to all the tribes of the earth. The phrase assures that no one will be able to ignore or deny His return, fulfilling the prophecy of a global revelation.<p><b>even those who pierced Him</b><br>This phrase refers to those responsible for Jesus' crucifixion, both literally and symbolically. It echoes <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which prophesies that the inhabitants of Jerusalem will look upon the one they have pierced and mourn. Historically, this includes the Roman soldiers and Jewish leaders involved in His death, but it also extends to all humanity, as our sins necessitated His sacrifice. This highlights the accountability and recognition of Jesus' true identity at His return.<p><b>And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him</b><br>The mourning of the tribes signifies a global acknowledgment of Christ's lordship and the realization of His judgment. This mourning can be seen as both a response of repentance and regret for those who have rejected Him. It connects to <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, where the tribes of the earth mourn at the sight of the Son of Man coming in glory. This mourning reflects the fulfillment of divine justice and the ultimate vindication of Christ's authority.<p><b>So shall it be! Amen.</b><br>This concluding affirmation emphasizes the certainty and divine approval of the prophecy. "So shall it be" is a declaration of the inevitability of these events, while "Amen" is a term of agreement and truth, often used to affirm the reliability of God's promises. This phrase reassures believers of the fulfillment of God's plan and the ultimate triumph of Christ's return, encouraging faith and perseverance in anticipation of His coming.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, He is the one who is coming with the clouds.

John seals the promise with a double affirmation, assuring us that Christ&#8217;s return is certain and imminent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Behold, he cometh with clouds.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">with the clouds.</span> The reference to Christ's words (<a href="/mark/14-62.htm" title="And Jesus said, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Mark 14:62</a>) is undoubted. In the "clouds" St. Augustine sees the emblem of the saints of the Church, which is His body, who spread as a vast fertilising cloud over the whole world.<p><span class= "bld">Every eye shall see him, and they also which</span> (<span class= "ital">they were who = </span>"whosoever") <span class= "bld">pierced him.</span>--Here again is a reference to the incident of the piercing of Christ's side (<a href="/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>), recorded only by St. John.<p><span class= "bld">Shall wail because of him.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">shall wail over Him.</span> The prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, is the suggesting one of this. But the passage in Zechariah describes the mourning of grief over the dead; the passage here is the mourning towards one who was dead, and is alive. He towards whom they now direct their sorrow is the One over whom they should have wailed when He was laid in His tomb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It is difficult to determine the exact connexion of these verses with one another, and with what precedes and follows. It seems best to make ver. 7 a kind of appendix to the salutation, and ver. 8 a kind of prelude to the whole book. They each give us one of the fundamental thoughts of the Apocalypse; ver. 7, Christ's certain return to judgment; ver. 8, his perfect Divinity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh</span>. He who loveth us and cleansed us and made us to be a kingdom will assuredly come. While interpreting the verse of the second advent, we need not exclude the coming to "those who pierced him" in the destruction of Jerusalem, and to "the tribes of the earth" in the breakup of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">With the clouds.</span> This probably refers to <a href="/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>, "Ye shall see the Son of man ... coming with the clouds of heaven" (comp. <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, "Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven"). Aquinas and other writers make the clouds symbolize the saints, "who rain by preaching, glisten by working miracles, are lifted up by refusing earthly things, fly by lofty contemplation." <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> also; better, <span class="accented">and all they who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">pierced him.</span> This is strong evidence of common authorship between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> St. John alone mentions the piercing. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Here and in <a href="/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in quoting <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, deserts the LXX. and follows the Masoretic Hebrew text. The LXX. softens down "pierced" into "insulted" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "piercing" appearing a violent expression to use respecting men's treatment of Jehovah. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Here and in <a href="/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in translating from the Hebrew, uses the uncommon Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>. The reference here is to all those who "crucify the Son of God afresh," not merely to the Jews. In what follows the Revised Version is to be preferred: "and all <span class="accented">the tribes</span> of the earth shall <span class="accented">mourn over</span> him? The wording is similar to <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and the LXX. of <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. The mourning is that of beating the breast, not wailing, and it is "over <span class="accented">him"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1fbf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so, Amen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, like "Abba, Father" (<a href="/mark/4-36.htm">Mark 4:36</a>; <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>), combines a Hebrew word with its Greek equivalent (comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(Idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
