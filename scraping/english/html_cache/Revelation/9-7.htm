The description suggests a readiness and strength for warfare, indicating a formidable and organized force. In ancient warfare, horses were symbols of power and speed, often used in chariots and cavalry. The locusts' appearance as horses emphasizes their destructive potential and the terror they bring. This vision may symbolize a spiritual or demonic army unleashed upon the earth, reflecting the chaos and judgment during the end times.<p><b>with something like crowns of gold on their heads</b><br>The crowns suggest authority and victory, as crowns were often worn by rulers and victors in ancient times. The gold indicates a semblance of divine or kingly power, though it is only "something like" crowns, implying a deceptive or counterfeit nature. This could represent the false authority or deceptive power of the forces of evil during the tribulation period, as they attempt to mimic divine authority.<p><b>and their faces were like the faces of men</b><br>This human-like feature suggests intelligence and cunning, distinguishing these locusts from ordinary insects. The human face may symbolize the deceptive and persuasive nature of these forces, capable of reasoning and manipulation. It reflects the idea that the spiritual battle involves not just brute force but also psychological and intellectual warfare. This anthropomorphic description aligns with the biblical theme of spiritual entities possessing human-like characteristics, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a> and <a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13</a>, where spiritual beings interact with the human realm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts.htm">Locusts</a></b><br>Symbolic creatures in the vision of John, representing a form of divine judgment.

They possess delegated, dazzling authority, yet remain under God&#8217;s ultimate control.<p>3. Their human-like faces reveal intentional, intelligent torment, reminding humanity that rebellion invites wrath even from beings that resemble us.<p>The verse assures believers that every detail of end-time judgment unfolds exactly as foretold, urging watchfulness and trust in the One who wields both justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And the shapes . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the shapes (or, forms) of the locusts were like horses made ready for war. </span>The resemblance of the locust to the horse (especially in the head) has been remarked upon by travellers, and has found expression in the Italian and German names cavalletta and heupferd. The resemblance is more distinct when the horses are made ready for battle: the hard shell or scales of the locust having the appearance of armour. Hence it has been thought that the sacred writer here alludes to this horse-like appearance of the locust. It seems a little doubtful that this is the case, or that in this or any of the descriptions here there is any reference to the anatomical features of the locust. (See Note on <a href="/revelation/9-10.htm" title="And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.">Revelation 9:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</span>--Here again there has been a desire to find some physical appearance in the locust to suggest the crown of gold: the antennae, the rugged elevation in the middle of the thorax, have been imagined to have some resemblance to a crown; and the face of the locust, it has actually been said, bears under ordinary circumstances a distant (the adjective is most needful) resemblance to the human countenance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the likenesses of the locusts</span>; that is to say, the general appearance. This similarity is brought out in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>, and is alluded to in <a href="/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>. The parallel is worked out at some length in Tristram's 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 314. In what way they appeared "prepared unto battle," is shown in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And on their heads were as it were crowns like gold;</span> <span class="accented">crowns like unto gold.</span> The language is carefully guarded so as to make it understood that this feature is altogether supernatural. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> of <span class="accented">gold</span> probably denote the conquering nature of the locusts, and thus they add to the power with which the locusts have already been invested. They may also signify the exalted temporal position of those symbolized by the locusts. Some writers believe the helmets of soldiers are typified, and others the turbans of the Mohammedans. <span class="cmt_word">And their faces were as the faces of men.</span> Notwithstanding the general resemblance of the locusts to horses, which resemblance is most clearly shadowed forth in the structure of the head, yet their faces gave the seer the idea of the human countenance. How this was brought about we are not told. Probably St. John himself in his vision received the impression without knowing by what means. The circumstance seems to point decidedly to the fact that human agents are denoted by the locusts.. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Genitive Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
