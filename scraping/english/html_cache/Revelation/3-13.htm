It echoes the words of Jesus in the Gospels, particularly in <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a> and <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His teachings. The "ear" symbolizes the ability to comprehend spiritual truths, suggesting that not everyone will be receptive to the message.<p><b>let him hear</b><br>The imperative "let him hear" underscores the responsibility of the listener to actively engage with the message. In the biblical context, hearing implies obedience and action, not just passive listening. This call to hear is a recurring theme in the letters to the seven churches in Revelation, emphasizing the need for discernment and response to divine instruction.<p><b>what the Spirit says</b><br>The "Spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's will and truth to believers. In the context of Revelation, the Spirit is the source of prophetic revelation, guiding the churches in understanding and applying the messages given to them. This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit as a teacher and comforter, as seen in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>.<p><b>to the churches</b><br>The term "churches" refers to the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation chapters 2 and 3. These churches were real congregations in cities like Ephesus, Smyrna, and Laodicea, each facing unique challenges and receiving specific messages. The plural form indicates that the message is not just for one church but for all, suggesting a universal application for the entire body of Christ. The historical and cultural context of these churches provides insight into the specific issues they faced, such as persecution, false teaching, and complacency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's message to the churches.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches.htm">The Churches</a></b><br>The seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in the Book of Revelation, representing the universal church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of Revelation, who received the vision and message from Jesus Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/patmos.htm">Patmos</a></b><br>The island where John was exiled and received the Revelation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asia_minor.htm">Asia Minor</a></b><br>The region where the seven churches were located, in present-day Turkey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>The phrase "He who has an ear, let him hear" calls for active listening and spiritual discernment.

Of the condition of the Church in Philadelphia we know nothing from Holy Writ, except what is contained in the passage before us. But its comparative immunity from trouble and destruction, and its continued existence to the present day (see on vers. 7-13, "Philadelphia"), render it probable that the message of the apostle was not without some effect. Thus Gibbon writes: "In the loss of Ephesus the Christians deplored the fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first candlestick, of the Revelation; the desolation is complete; and the Temple of Diana or the Church of Mary will equally elude the search of the curious traveller. The circus and three stately theatres of Laodicea are now peopled with wolves and foxes; Sardis is reduced to a miserable village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a Son, is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira and Pergamos, and the populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign trade of the Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by prophecy or courage" ('Decline and Fall,' c). 64. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
