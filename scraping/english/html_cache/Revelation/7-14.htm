The elder's question and John's response indicate a recognition of the elder's superior knowledge and authority. This interaction is reminiscent of similar dialogues in prophetic literature, such as Ezekiel's conversations with God, where the prophet acknowledges divine wisdom. It underscores the humility and reverence required when approaching divine mysteries.<p><b>So he replied, &#8220;These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation;</b><br>The "great tribulation" refers to a period of intense suffering and persecution, often interpreted as a future event preceding the end times. This concept is rooted in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, which speaks of a time of unprecedented distress. Historically, early Christians faced severe persecution, and this passage offers hope and assurance of deliverance. Theologically, it emphasizes God's sovereignty and the ultimate triumph of His people over adversity.<p><b>they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</b><br>The imagery of washing robes in blood to make them white is paradoxical, highlighting the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice. In biblical symbolism, white represents purity and righteousness. The "blood of the Lamb" refers to Jesus Christ's atoning death, drawing on the Passover lamb imagery from <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a> and the sacrificial system in Leviticus. This phrase connects to <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, where sins, though scarlet, become white as snow.

Are we to limit the expression to the special and peculiar afflictions of the last great trial? There is no doubt about the emphasis which the definite article (unfortunately, ignored in our English version) gives: it is <span class= "ital">the</span> great tribulation; but while there may yet be in store for the Church of Christ trials so great that they may be called, in comparison with those which went before, <span class= "ital">the</span> great tribulation, it yet seems out of harmony with the spirit of the Apocalypse and the complexion of this vision to limit the phrase to some special season of trial. Is not the great tribulation the tribulation which those must encounter who are on the side of Christ and righteousness, and refuse to receive the mark of worldliness and sin on their heart, conscience, and life? In all ages it is true that we must through much tribulation enter the Kingdom of God; and the vision here is surely not of those who will come safe out of some particular trials, but of the great multitude from every age and every race who waged war against sin, and who, in the midst of that protracted conflict, endured the great tribulation which is to continue until Christ's return. <span class= "ital">And they washed</span> (not "have washed," for the washing was done during their earthly life) <span class= "ital">their robes</span>, <span class= "ital">and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</span> The imagery is to be found in the Gospel and in the Epistle (<a href="/context/john/13-8.htm" title="Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.">John 13:8-11</a>; and <a href="/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>); its use here and in <a href="/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a> (if the reading <span class= "ital">washed</span> is to be preferred to <span class= "ital">loosed)</span> points to a common authorship: the emblem of the <span class= "ital">blood which washes white,</span> or cleanses, is not used with such distinctness elsewhere in the New Testament. It is, in St. John's lips, but a following out of the twice-repeated words which he quotes from John the Baptist at the opening of the Gospel, when he proclaimed Christ to be "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world." In that Lamb of God those who came out of great tribulation found the forgiveness and the spiritual power which gave them confidence and hope in the midst of life's war and life's weariness; for the man who knows that he is forgiven and that he is being helped to holiness is the man who thinks no fiery trial strange, but rejoices in the knowledge that his salvation is of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest;</span> <span class="accented">and I say unto him, My lord</span> (Revised Version). The expression denotes the utmost respect and reverence, which afterwards induce the seer to worship the angel (see <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a>). The structure of this part of the vision recalls <a href="/ezekiel/37-3.htm">Ezekiel 37:3</a>, "And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest" (cf. <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2, 4, 5</a>; <a href="/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation;</span> <span class="accented">which come out of the great tribulation</span> (Revised Version). The repeated article is especially emphatic. The question arises What is "the great tribulation" referred to? Probably all the tribulation which has been passed through by the redeemed, all that which pertained to the life though which they have passed. This tribulation is now completed and past, and is therefore referred to as "the great tribulation." "These are they which have passed through the great tribulation of their life on earth." This is the view taken by Alford. Dusterdieck refers the expression to the last great trial of the saints before the coming of the Lord. Some point to particular persecutions as the reference intended, and others consider that "the last great trial to be expected under the seventh seal" is meant. <span class="cmt_word">And have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">and they washed</span>, etc. That is, during their past life, while they were experiencing the great tribulation, they washed their robes (cf. <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5</a>, where those who have "not defiled their garments" and those "that overcome" are to be clothed in white). Those that overcome and are undefiled, therefore, are those who have washed themselves in the blood of the Lamb, through which only their victory is possible or effective. Arethas, Bede, De Lyra, consider that the robes are washed of those who have endured martyrdom, and that they are washed in the blood of the Lamb, because it is the blood of his members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Sir,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(mou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
