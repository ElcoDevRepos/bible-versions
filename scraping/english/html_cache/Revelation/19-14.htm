In biblical context, these armies are often understood to be composed of angels and the redeemed saints. The imagery of heavenly armies is consistent with Old Testament depictions, such as in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant sees the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire. The presence of these armies signifies divine power and authority, reinforcing the theme of Christ's ultimate victory over evil.<p><b>dressed in fine linen, white and pure</b><br>Fine linen, white and pure, symbolizes righteousness and holiness. In <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>, the fine linen is explicitly stated to represent the righteous acts of the saints. This attire contrasts with the garments of sin and impurity, highlighting the transformation and sanctification of those who follow Christ.

This imagery is consistent with the portrayal of Christ as the conquering King in <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>, where He is described as riding a white horse. The followers of Christ, sharing in His victory, also ride white horses, signifying their participation in His triumph over evil. This scene fulfills prophecies of the Messiah's ultimate victory, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3-5</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_armies_of_heaven.htm">The Armies of Heaven</a></b><br>This refers to the celestial beings or possibly the redeemed saints who accompany Christ in His triumphant return.
