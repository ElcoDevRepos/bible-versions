In biblical literature, a "mighty voice" often signifies a message of great importance, often delivered by an angel or a divine messenger. This echoes the Old Testament prophets who often spoke with authority when delivering God's messages (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>).<p><b>Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!</b><br>The repetition of "fallen" emphasizes the certainty and completeness of Babylon's destruction. Babylon symbolizes a system of worldly power and corruption, often associated with idolatry and opposition to God. Historically, Babylon was a powerful empire known for its wealth and decadence. In Revelation, it represents the ultimate downfall of human pride and rebellion against God, similar to the fall of historical Babylon as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a>.<p><b>She has become a lair for demons</b><br>This imagery suggests desolation and spiritual corruption. In ancient times, ruins were often thought to be inhabited by evil spirits. The reference to demons indicates a complete moral and spiritual decay, aligning with the idea that Babylon's fall is not just physical but also spiritual, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>.<p><b>and a haunt for every unclean spirit,</b><br>The term "unclean spirit" refers to demonic forces or influences that are opposed to God. This phrase underscores the total abandonment of Babylon to evil, highlighting its spiritual desolation. It reflects the biblical theme of judgment where God allows evil to consume what is already corrupt, as seen in <a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>.<p><b>every unclean bird,</b><br>Unclean birds, according to Levitical law (Leviticus 11), were those that were not to be eaten and often symbolized impurity. The presence of such birds in Babylon signifies its complete defilement and abandonment. This imagery is consistent with prophetic descriptions of desolation, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>.<p><b>and every detestable beast.</b><br>Detestable beasts further symbolize impurity and chaos. In biblical symbolism, beasts often represent nations or powers that oppose God (Daniel 7). The presence of these creatures in Babylon signifies its utter ruin and the reversal of God's created order, reflecting the consequences of sin and rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon_the_great.htm">Babylon the Great</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, corrupt system or city that opposes God.

The &#8220;mighty voice&#8221; underscores divine authority, much like the &#8220;loud voice&#8221; of the strong angel in <a href="/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a> or the proclamation of judgment in <a href="/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a>. God does not whisper His verdict on a system so corrupt; He declares it unmistakably. The forceful cry assures believers that the coming judgment is neither rumor nor metaphor but a certain, imminent reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!</b><p>The double declaration echoes <a href="/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a> and reinforces finality&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s collapse is irrevocable. In <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a> the same words serve as an early warning; here, in chapter 18, the prophetic future becomes present. Whether Babylon represents a last-days world empire, a corrupt economic system, or the culmination of all human rebellion, the point remains: every anti-God structure will crumble. <a href="/daniel/2-34.htm">Daniel 2:34-35</a> portrays a similar toppling when the stone (Christ&#8217;s kingdom) smashes earthly kingdoms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She has become a lair for demons</b><p>Once a hub of human ambition, Babylon is now pictured as a desolate haunt for evil powers. Jesus spoke of unclean spirits seeking &#8220;rest&#8221; in waterless places (<a href="/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>). Likewise, <a href="/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a> describes deserted Edom as a gathering spot for evil creatures. God&#8217;s judgment flips Babylon&#8217;s fortunes: what seemed prosperous becomes a spiritual wasteland, emphasizing the literal bondage behind worldly allure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And a haunt for every unclean spirit</b><p>The phrase widens the scope: not just some, but every unclean spirit claims this ruined city. <a href="/mark/5-2.htm">Mark 5:2-13</a> records how legion demons inhabited tombs; here, the entirety of Babylon is a vast tomb. <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a> reminds believers their struggle is against &#8220;spiritual forces of evil,&#8221; and <a href="/bsb/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a> exposes where those forces ultimately congregate&#8212;among the ashes of their own domain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every unclean bird</b><p><a href="/leviticus/11-13.htm">Leviticus 11:13-19</a> lists birds symbolizing impurity; <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a> predicts that fallen Babylon will be inhabited by desert creatures and owls. The image speaks of lifelessness and filth. Instead of bustling trade routes (<a href="/revelation/18-11.htm">Revelation 18:11-17</a>), scavenger birds circle emptiness. God&#8217;s judgment strips away glamour to reveal decay.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every detestable beast</b><p><a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a> foresees wild animals dwelling in ruined Babylon. The &#8220;detestable beast&#8221; label ties back to idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a>) and to the beastly empire of <a href="/bsb/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. Babylon&#8217;s final residents mirror her nature&#8212;unclean, lawless, opposed to God. The transformation is complete: once &#8220;great,&#8221; now grotesque.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a> announces Babylon&#8217;s definitive downfall. Heaven proclaims it loudly; earth receives it literally. What humanity built apart from God collapses under divine judgment, becoming a desolate refuge for demonic forces and unclean creatures. For believers, the verse is both warning and comfort: warning to shun worldly compromise, comfort that evil&#8217;s reign is temporary and Christ&#8217;s victory certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And he cried . . .</span>--We must omit "mightily," and render, <span class= "ital">And he cried in a mighty voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become an habitation of demons, and a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hated bird.</span> Those who walk in darkness, and whose eyes the god of this world hath blinded through their lusts, look only on the material side, upon prosperous times, large revenues, rapidly developing resources. The great city of the world looks fair and glorious in their eyes, and even the godly are dazzled by her beauty; but when the light of heaven shines, her fall is seen to be inevitable, for she is seen to be hateful; her palaces are seen to be prisons, her highest wisdom little more than low cunning, her most exalted intelligence base-born, her sweetest songs discordant cries; the evil spirit, welcomed back, has come in seven-fold power; for the dry places afford no rest to those who still love sin and the pleasures of sin. The description in this verse is drawn largely from <a href="/context/isaiah/13-21.htm" title="But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.">Isaiah 13:21-22</a>; it is a picture of desolation and degradation, but it has its moral counterpart.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying;</span> <span class="accented">and he cried with a strong voice, saying.</span> This "strong voice" is characteristic of the heavenly utterances (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-2.htm">Revelation 7:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen.</span> The event, though future, is described as past, being predetermined in the counsels of God.
