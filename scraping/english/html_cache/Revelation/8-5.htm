The censer, a vessel used for burning incense, symbolizes prayer and worship. In the Old Testament, the high priest used a censer in the temple to offer incense before God (<a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>). This act signifies the mediation between God and humanity, reflecting the prayers of the saints ascending to God (<a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>).<p><b>filled it with fire from the altar</b><br>The altar here is reminiscent of the altar of incense in the tabernacle and temple, where incense was burned as a fragrant offering to God (<a href="/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30:1-10</a>). Fire from the altar represents divine judgment and purification. In <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>, a seraphim uses a coal from the altar to purify Isaiah's lips, symbolizing cleansing and preparation for God's service.<p><b>and hurled it to the earth</b><br>This action signifies the transition from intercession to judgment. The hurling of fire to the earth indicates the commencement of divine retribution. It echoes the prophetic imagery found in <a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2</a>, where coals of fire are scattered over Jerusalem as a sign of impending judgment.<p><b>and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake</b><br>These phenomena are often associated with theophany, the visible manifestation of God, and are indicative of His power and majesty (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>). They serve as a prelude to significant divine action, as seen in the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. In Revelation, these elements frequently accompany the unfolding of God's judgments (<a href="/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5, 11</a>:19, 16:18), underscoring the seriousness and inevitability of His decrees.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A heavenly being tasked with executing God's judgment.

The censer moves from offering incense to hurling fire, proving that heaven hears earth&#8217;s cries and responds in power. The thunder, lightning, and quake confirm that the Lord is present and active, ushering in the trumpet judgments that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And the angel . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the angel has taken</span> (or, <span class= "ital">took) the censer, and he filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast it (i.e.,</span> the fire or hot ashes which filled the censer) <span class= "ital">upon the earth.</span> The prayers have gone up, and the sprinkling of the ashes earthward is the symbol of the answer descending from heaven. We may recall the similar action of Moses before Pharaoh, when he took ashes of the furnace and sprinkled it towards heaven, but it descended towards earth, as a symbol of the plague about to fall upon the land (<a href="/context/exodus/9-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.">Exodus 9:8-10</a>). The hot ashes are the tokens of the coming judgments. As in the parallel vision in Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/10-2.htm" title="And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.">Ezekiel 10:2</a>), when the man clothed with linen is bidden to "go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill his hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the doomed city;" so here the ashes fall--the judgments are at hand<p><span class= "bld">And there were voices</span> <span class= "bld">. . </span>.--Or, <span class= "ital">And there took place thunders, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</span> There is some variety among the MSS. in the order of the words here used. Some place "lightnings" before "voices." These signs and sounds herald the approach of judgments. God has arisen in answer to the cry of His people. "The earth shook and trembled. There went up a smoke and a fire: coals were kindled at it. At the brightness that was before Him His thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire. The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave His voice, hailstones and coals of fire. Yea, He sent out His arrows, and scattered them: He shot out lightnings and discomfited them . . . He delivered me from my strong enemy" (<a href="/context/psalms/18-4.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.">Psalm 18:4-19</a>). It is a solemn thought that we may send up prayers, and the answer may come down a judgment; for often it is only through judgment that true loving-kindness can make her way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth;</span> <span class="accented">taketh the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it upon the earth</span> (Revised Version). The angel now returns to the altar of burnt offering, whence he takes fire, which he casts upon the earth. This action denotes that God's judgments are about to descend on the earth, and it therefore forms the visible token of God's acceptance of the prayers of the saints, and his answer to them. <span class="cmt_word">And there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake;</span> <span class="accented">and there followed thunders, and voices</span>, etc. (Revised Version). The manifestation of God's presence or of his judgments is continually accompanied by awe-striking phenomena, such as are here described (see on Revelation 6:12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
