In biblical prophecy, "one day" often symbolizes a swift and decisive action by God. The use of "plagues" echoes the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, signifying divine retribution. The suddenness emphasizes the certainty and severity of God's judgment.<p><b>death and grief and famine&#8212;</b><br>These specific plagues reflect the comprehensive nature of the judgment. "Death" signifies the end of life and can be seen as a direct consequence of sin. "Grief" or mourning indicates the emotional and societal impact of the judgment. "Famine" represents economic collapse and the failure of sustenance, reminiscent of the curses in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Together, they portray a complete dismantling of the city's power and prosperity.<p><b>and she will be consumed by fire,</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol of purification and judgment. It suggests total destruction, leaving nothing behind. This imagery is consistent with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and the prophesied destruction of Babylon in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. Fire also represents God's holiness and the consuming nature of His judgment.<p><b>for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the power and authority of God as the ultimate judge. It affirms that the judgment is not arbitrary but is executed by the sovereign Lord. The might of God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing His ability to fulfill His purposes. This connects to other biblical passages that highlight God's sovereignty, such as <a href="/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>.

Some writers see here an allusion to the second, third, and fourth seals (see <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">And she shall he utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</span> <span class="accented">Who judged her</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and others. This is the fulfilment of the predicted punishment of the harlot (<a href="/revelation/17-16.htm">Revelation 17:16</a>). The last clause replies, as it were, to the boast in ver. 7, "I sit as a queen," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/18-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Therefore</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8134;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
