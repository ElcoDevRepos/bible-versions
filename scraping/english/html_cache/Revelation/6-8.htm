This color symbolizes death and decay, reflecting the grim nature of the rider. In biblical symbolism, horses often represent power and movement, and the color here indicates a sickly, deathly presence. The vision of the horse is part of the opening of the fourth seal, a continuation of the apocalyptic imagery that began with the first seal in <a href="/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6:1</a>.<p><b>Its rider&#8217;s name was Death,</b><br>The rider is explicitly named Death, personifying the inevitable end of life. This is a rare instance in the Bible where death is personified, emphasizing its power and reach. In the context of Revelation, Death is not just a natural end but a force unleashed upon the earth as part of divine judgment. This aligns with the biblical theme that death entered the world through sin (<a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>) and is the last enemy to be destroyed (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>).<p><b>and Hades followed close behind.</b><br>Hades, in Greek mythology, is the realm of the dead, akin to Sheol in Hebrew thought. Here, Hades is depicted as following Death, suggesting that as people die, they enter this realm. This imagery underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment, where not only physical death occurs but also a spiritual consequence. The pairing of Death and Hades is seen elsewhere in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18, 20</a>:13-14), highlighting their temporary dominion until the final judgment.<p><b>And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth,</b><br>The phrase indicates a limited but significant scope of authority, suggesting that the judgment is severe but not total. The fraction "a fourth" implies a partial judgment, allowing for repentance and the continuation of God's redemptive plan. This limitation reflects God's mercy even in judgment, as seen in other biblical instances where God restrains total destruction (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>).<p><b>to kill by sword, by famine, by plague, and by the beasts of the earth.</b><br>These four methods of death are reminiscent of the covenant curses found in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to such calamities. The sword represents war and violence, famine indicates scarcity and economic collapse, plague suggests disease and pestilence, and beasts imply chaos and danger from nature. These judgments echo the Old Testament prophets, such as <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, where similar judgments are described. They serve as a call to repentance and a reminder of the consequences of sin, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pale_horse.htm">Pale Horse</a></b><br>Represents death and destruction.

The passage warns of coming wrath, affirms the trustworthiness of Scripture, and points ultimately to the One who holds the keys of Death and Hades&#8212;and who alone can save all who turn to Him before these events arrive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I looked;</span> <span class="accented">I saw.</span> The usual expression drawing attention to a new sight or fresh phase of the vision (see on Revelation 4:1; ver. 2, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And behold a pale horse</span>. <span class="accented">Pale</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "greenish-white, livid"); the colour of one stricken with disease or death, or moved with emotions of terror. The same word is used of the green grass in <a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a> and in <a href="/mark/6-39.htm">Mark 6:39</a>, and of the vegetation in <a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>; but, applied to man, it is generally connected with terror, disease, or death. The Greek poets use it as an epithet of fear, and Thucydides thus describes the colour of persons affected by the plague. <span class="cmt_word">And his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.</span> The preposition differs from that used in the preceding verses: it is here <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>,"above," not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "upon." <span class="accented">And he who was sitting above him, his name</span> [was] <span class="accented">Death.</span> Here we have it plainly stated that the vision is a personification of Death - death in general, death in any and every way, as indicated in the latter part of the verse. This supports the view taken of the first three visions of the seals (see on ver. 2). <span class="accented">Hades</span> follows with <span class="accented">Death</span>, not as a separate infliction, but as the necessary complement of Death in the completion of the vision, swallowing up and guarding, as it were, those seized by the latter. <span class="accented">Death</span> is personified in a similar way in <a href="/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, "Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;" and <span class="accented">Hades</span> in <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, "Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming." The two are also conjoined in <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, "The keys of hell and of death;" and in <a href="/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13, 14</a>, "Death and hell delivered up the dead." Hades cannot signify the place of torment, as Hengstenberg thinks, since these trials are to be inflicted on Christians, not on the wicked merely. Nor is it consonant with the context to suppose (as Ebrard) that <span class="accented">Hades</span> signifies "the dwellers in Hades." <span class="cmt_word">And power was given unto them.</span> The reading "them" is supported by A, C, [P], <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, n 17, 49 (1.40 e sil) Andreas; while B and the Vulgate read <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f7a;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, "him." The context shows that both are intended. <span class="cmt_word">Over the fourth part of the earth.</span> There is a general consensus of opinion that this expression betokens a part of mankind. Why the <span class="accented">fourth</span> part is selected is difficult to say. Alford suggests that a reference is intended to the four first seals, each one of which embraces in its action a portion of mankind. But the first seal can hardly be interpreted in this way. Probably the intention is to denote that a part of mankind must be afflicted in this particular way, though no definite proportion is signified. In other words, the second, third, and fourth seals depict troubles which Christians and all mankind will have to undergo; some being afflicted more especially in one way, others in another. The troubles mentioned are not an exhaustive catalogue, but are typical of all sorrows; the selection being probably prompted by the Old Testament passages quoted below, viz. <a href="/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>; and <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. "The fourth part" is an expression found only in this passage. Zullig agrees with Alford in the explanation given above; Hengstenberg, and somewhat similarly Volkmar, think it denotes the partial character of this judgment. Elliott, with very little reason, follows the Vulgate reading, "over the four parts of the earth;" Isaac Williams also thinks the judgment is universal, since that is the idea that the number <span class="accented">four</span> signifies, which, however, is a different thing from a <span class="accented">fourth part. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</span> The passage is another example of the influence of the prophecy of Ezekiel upon the composition of the Apocalypse. In <a href="/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> the "four sore judgments" are "the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence? This indicates the signification of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> in this place; viz. death by pestilence, not, as in the preceding passage, death in any form (comp. <a href="/leviticus/26-23.htm">Leviticus 26:23-26</a>, where the judgments threatened are the sword, <span class="accented">pestilence</span>, and famine. Cf. also the alternative punishments of David (<a href="/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>); also 2 Esdras 15:5 <span class="bible_ref">4 Esdr. 15:5</span>, "the sword, and hunger, and death, and destruction"). The wild <span class="accented">beasts of the earth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is very probably a reference to the death of many Christians in the pagan amphitheatres; though the meaning is not necessarily restricted to this form of death. Those to whom the Apocalypse was first addressed would irresistibly be reminded of our Lord's words in <a href="/matthew/24-7.htm">Matthew 24:7, 13</a>, "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places... But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved." It is as though St. John echoed the words of our Lord, "These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me" (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and would say, "I am commissioned to relate these visions of the present and future trials of all in the world, which, however, have been already foretold you by our blessed Lord himself." While, therefore, this passage may be understood literally, since doubtless the Church has suffered all these afflictions at different times, in different members of her body, yet we must understand these four typical judgments to be representative of trouble in all its forms; the fourfold character pointing to its universal nature (see on Revelation 5:9). This has led many writers to see in these inflictions trials of a spiritual nature - a view which may well be included in the proper application, but must not be pressed to the exclusion of any other more literal interpretation. We may thus sum up the results of our investigation of these eight verses. They relate the circumstances attending the opening of the first four seals, and doubtless typify various phases of the trials which are permitted by God to afflict Christians on earth in common with all mankind. Each of the four visions is preceded by the invitation of one of the four living beings, which are representative of creation; and a second feature common to these four visions is the appearance of a rider as the personification of the idea set forth. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The visions open with a personification of <span class="accented">Christianity</span>, and an assurance of the ultimate victory which it will gain over the powers of the world. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Then appears a vision of <span class="accented">war</span>, as one of the typical troubles of mankind, which will ultimately be overcome by the triumph of Christianity. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Next follows <span class="accented">famine</span> with all its attendant evils, though it is not permitted to extend to the extremity of the extirpation of mankind.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I looked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
