This posture symbolizes dominion over the entire earth, both land and sea, indicating a message of universal significance. The imagery of standing on both sea and land may also reflect the comprehensive scope of God's sovereignty and judgment. In biblical context, angels often serve as messengers or agents of God's will, as seen in <a href="/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a> and throughout Revelation.

This act is reminiscent of the practice in ancient cultures, including Hebrew tradition, where raising the hand was part of making a vow or swearing an oath (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>). The right hand is often associated with power and authority in biblical literature (<a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, <a href="/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>).

Just as God orderly unfolded the seals (<a href="/bsb/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>) and the trumpets (<a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8-9</a>), He now inserts another intentional step. This reinforces that every detail of end-time judgment happens neither randomly nor symbolically, but in literal, divinely timed succession (cf. <a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the angel I had seen</b><p>John identifies this angel as the same mighty figure introduced earlier in <a href="/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-2</a>. That continuity roots the vision in eyewitness testimony: John is carefully reporting what he truly &#8220;saw&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). By repeating the identification, Scripture underscores that God often employs a single messenger to carry out multiple stages of His plan, much like the &#8220;angel of the LORD&#8221; guided Israel through the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) and reappeared at decisive moments (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; 13:3).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>standing on the sea and on the land</b><p>The angel&#8217;s stance dramatizes universal authority.

In Scripture, the right hand represents power and fidelity (<a href="/psalms/98-1.htm">Psalm 98:1</a>). When the angel lifts his right hand:<p>&#8226; He signals an unbreakable pledge about what he is about to declare (<a href="/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He mirrors the &#8220;man dressed in linen&#8221; who raised his hand in <a href="/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a> to swear that end-time events would conclude &#8220;in a time, times, and half a time,&#8221; linking Daniel&#8217;s prophecy with Revelation&#8217;s timeline.<p>&#8226; He models godly integrity, reminding believers of Jesus&#8217; instruction to let their &#8220;Yes&#8221; be yes (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to heaven</b><p>Pointing upward identifies the ultimate witness and guarantor of the oath: the eternal Creator. <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a> will state explicitly that the angel swears &#8220;by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it.&#8221; This act:<p>&#8226; Anchors the oath in God&#8217;s unchanging nature (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Highlights the direct line of authority from the throne (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-11</a>) to the angel&#8217;s mission.<p>&#8226; Encourages believers to look heavenward for assurance, echoing <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-2</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a> depicts a literal angel, already introduced to John, dramatically claiming all creation for God and swearing an unbreakable oath.

The scene assures believers that God&#8217;s end-time program unfolds exactly as promised, under His sovereign control, and in full view of heaven&#8217;s throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5-7) <span class= "bld">And the angel . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth lifted his right hand to the heaven, and sware in </span>(or, by)<span class= "ital"> Him who liveth unto the ages of the ages, who created the heaven, and the things in it, and the earth, and the things in it, and the sea, and the things in it, that time </span>(i.e., delay, or postponement)<span class= "ital"> should no longer be: but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound (his trumpet) was finished the mystery of God, as he evangelised his servants the prophets</span>. There is a change of tense which sounds strange: he says, then (not "will be," but) was finished. In thought he hurries on to the end, and sees the close no longer in the dim future, but as, with the eye of God, an accomplished fact. The certainty is guaranteed with an oath. The gesture of the uplifted hand to give emphasis to the oath is of ancient date. Thus Abraham expressed his resolution to take none of the spoils of the conquered kings: "I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord . . . that I will not take from a thread to a shoelatchet" (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>; comp. <a href="/exodus/6-8.htm" title="And I will bring you in to the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.">Exodus 6:8</a>, margin). So, too, does the man clothed in linen (<a href="/context/daniel/12-6.htm" title="And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was on the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?">Daniel 12:6-9</a>, a passage which, in much, is the foundation of the one before us) lift up both hands and sware that there shall be a fixed period for the accomplishment of the scattering of the power of the holy people. The oath in the passage under consideration is to the effect (not that time should cease and eternity begin, but) that there shall be no longer any delay. The suffering saints had cried, "How long?" (<a href="/context/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9-11</a>), and they had been bidden to wait a little time. Now the close of all such waiting time is announced: when the seventh trumpet shall have blown the mystery of God will be finished. "' The mystery of God' does not mean something which cannot be understood or explained. It is never applied to such matters, for example, as the origin of evil, or the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity. It does mean a secret; but then a secret may be told, and when told is no mystery. The mystery, or secret, of God means, therefore, the whole of His plan and of His counsel concerning this earth in its present state of discipline and of imperfection; all that God means to do upon it and towards it, even till that which we read of as the time of the end (<a href="/context/daniel/12-4.htm" title="But you, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.">Daniel 12:4-9</a>), the close of this last dispensation, and the introduction of that new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness" (Dr. Vaughan). No wonder, as he announced this fast approaching close of the ages of suffering and trial, he should add, "According as He (not "declared"--an utterly inadequate word--but) evangelised--i.e., according to the glad tidings which He had ever proclaimed to and by His servants the prophets." A somewhat remarkable parallelism between this passage and <a href="/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1Corinthians 15:51-52</a>, has been pointed out. In both passages there is reference to the mystery, the glad tidings, and the last (the seventh trumpet is also the last) trumpet. This harmony of reference--taken in connection with St. Paul's statement, "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed"--is full of interest, if it were for nothing more than to notice the union of thought between the two Apostles; but it may also throw light upon the teaching respecting the first resurrection (<a href="/context/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5-6</a>; but see Note there). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven</span>; <span class="accented">the right hand</span> (Revised Version) is supported by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, P, Syriac, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Andreas, Arethas, Primasius.
