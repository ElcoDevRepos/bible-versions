The "wilderness" often symbolizes a place of desolation or spiritual testing, reminiscent of Israel's journey through the desert and Jesus' temptation. It suggests a setting removed from the distractions of the world, where divine revelations are made clear. The wilderness can also represent the spiritual barrenness of the world system opposed to God.<p><b>where I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast</b><br>The "woman" is later identified as "Babylon the Great," symbolizing a corrupt system or city opposed to God. Her sitting on the "scarlet beast" indicates a position of control or influence over this beast, which represents a powerful, anti-God political entity. The color "scarlet" is often associated with luxury, sin, and bloodshed, suggesting the opulence and moral corruption of this alliance.<p><b>that was covered with blasphemous names</b><br>Blasphemous names indicate a direct opposition to God, ascribing divine attributes or titles to something other than God. This reflects the beast's nature as a counterfeit to God's authority, reminiscent of the blasphemies spoken by the little horn in <a href="/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>. It underscores the beast's role in leading people away from true worship.<p><b>and had seven heads and ten horns</b><br>The "seven heads" and "ten horns" are symbolic of completeness and power, often interpreted as representing a coalition of kingdoms or rulers. This imagery is consistent with Daniel's visions (<a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7-8</a>) and is further explained in <a href="/revelation/17-9.htm">Revelation 17:9-12</a>, where the heads and horns are linked to specific kings and kingdoms.

Now the wild beast carries the woman; for she draws her support from the great world-power. The scene is the wilderness. The contrast between the desolation around her and the splendour of her appearance is striking and suggestive. The woman clothed with the sun (<a href="/revelation/12-1.htm" title="And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:">Revelation 12:1</a>), persecuted by the dragon, finds a home in the wilderness into which she is driven. She is persecuted, but not forsaken; she can joy in tribulation. The scarlet-clad woman, amid all her dazzling surroundings, is still in a wilderness. The runagates continue in scarceness. Sansjoy is the brother of Sansloy. The wild beast is scarlet in colour. The dragon was red (<a href="/revelation/12-3.htm" title="And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.">Revelation 12:3</a>); the woman is clothed in scarlet. Is it the emblem of lawlessness ending in violence? (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>). It has also a show of sovereignty.<p><span class= "bld">Full of names.</span>--<span class= "ital">Teeming with names, &c.</span>--The living creatures (<a href="/revelation/4-8.htm" title="And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.">Revelation 4:8</a>) <span class= "ital">teemed</span> (the same word as here) with eyes, the tokens of ready obedience and true intelligence. The wild beast teems with tokens of lawlessness and self-sufficiency.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he carried me away in the spirit;</span> <span class="accented">and he carried</span>, etc. (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a> and Revelation 21:10). In the latter reference the analogy is sufficiently close to lead us to believe that it is intended. <span class="cmt_word">Into the wilderness;</span> <span class="accented">a wilderness</span>, according to the Revised Version, which is the rendering of Wordsworth and others; but Alford strongly supports the Authorized Version rendering, notwithstanding the absence of the Greek article (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). Some commentators have thought that the "wilderness" signifies the desolation which is the lot of the harlot (see ver. 16; <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 19</a>; also <a href="/jeremiah/51-26.htm">Jeremiah 51:26</a>). But we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the "wilderness" here is that spoken of in <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6, 14</a>, which is symbolical of this world, particularly when we remember that the "wilderness" in both cases is the abode of a woman, who moreover is representative of the Church; though in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. she represents the Church of God as a whole, persecuted by Satan, and in this place the woman is representative of the faithless part of the Church (see also below on "beast"). Vitringa, referring to <a href="/isaiah/21-1.htm">Isaiah 21:1</a>, and <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 15</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/20-35.htm">Ezekiel 20:35</a>, arrives at a similar conclusion; it is a "wilderness of the people." <span class="cmt_word">And I saw a woman.</span> There is no article, but this vision, occurring immediately after the words of ver. 1, "I will show thee... the great harlot," identifies this <span class="accented">woman</span> with the harlot of ver. 1. This woman represents the faithless portion of the Church (see on ver. 1); that part which, following after worldly things, has thereby rendered to the beast the love and honour due to God alone. This woman is not identical with the woman of <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>. The latter represents the faithful, the former the faithless, part of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Sit upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span> Here again, as in "wilderness" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>), we have <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "beast," without the article; but the identity of this "beast" with that of <a href="/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a> is established by <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the same outward characteristics of names of blasphemy, seven heads and ten horns; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its connection with "kings," etc. (vers. 12-14 and <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19, 20</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its connection with the "false prophet" (<a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. and Revelation 19:20);  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the angel] carried me away</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#942;&#957;&#949;&#947;&#954;&#941;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ap&#275;nenken)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_667.htm">Strong's 667: </a> </span><span class="str2">To carry, bear away (sometimes with violence).
