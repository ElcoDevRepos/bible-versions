This identification is significant as it connects the message of Revelation to someone with direct experience and authority within the early Christian community. John is believed to have been exiled to the island of Patmos (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>) during the reign of Emperor Domitian, around 95 AD.<p><b>To the seven churches in the province of Asia:</b><br>The seven churches refer to specific Christian communities located in the Roman province of Asia, which is modern-day western Turkey. These churches are Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, suggesting that the message is intended for the entire Church. These churches were situated along a major postal route, indicating the strategic importance of their locations for the dissemination of the message.<p><b>Grace and peace to you</b><br>This greeting is common in New Testament epistles, combining the Greek greeting "grace" (charis) with the Hebrew greeting "peace" (shalom). It reflects the dual heritage of the early Church, rooted in both Jewish and Gentile traditions. The phrase emphasizes the unmerited favor and spiritual well-being that come from God.<p><b>from Him who is and was and is to come,</b><br>This description of God emphasizes His eternal nature and sovereignty over time. It echoes the divine name revealed to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, "I AM WHO I AM," highlighting God's unchanging and self-existent nature. This phrase reassures believers of God's control over history and His ultimate fulfillment of promises.<p><b>and from the seven spirits before His throne,</b><br>The "seven spirits" are often interpreted as a symbolic representation of the Holy Spirit in His fullness and perfection. This imagery may be drawn from <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, which describes the Spirit of the Lord resting upon the Messiah with seven attributes. The number seven again signifies completeness, suggesting the Holy Spirit's comprehensive presence and work in the world.

The unchanging God who rules past, present, and future lovingly addresses His people, setting the stage for the majestic unveiling of His plans and the certain triumph of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">JOHN to the seven churches</span> (or, <span class= "ital">congregations</span>) <span class= "bld">which are in Asia.</span>--It is needless to observe that the Asia here is not to be regarded as co-extensive with what we know as Asia Minor. It is the province of Asia (comp. <a href="/context/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9-10</a>; <a href="/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>), which was under a Roman proconsul, and embraced the western portion of Asia Minor. In St. John's time it consisted of a strip of sea-board, some 100 square miles in extent. Its boundaries varied at different periods; but roughly, and for the present purpose, they may be regarded as the Caycus on the north, the Maeander on the south, the Phrygian Hills on the east, and the Mediterranean on the west.<p><span class= "bld">Seven churches.</span>--It has been maintained by some (notably by Vitringa) that the epistles to the seven churches are prophetic, and set forth the condition of the Church in the successive epochs of its after-history. The growth of error, the development of schisms, the gloom of superstition, the darkness of mediaeval times, the dawn of the Reformation, the convulsions of after-revolutions, have been discovered in these brief and forcible epistles. Such a view needs no formal refutation. The anxiety for circumstantial and limited fulfilments of prophecy has been at the root of such attempts. When we read God's words as wider than our thoughts we stand in no need of such desperate efforts at symmetrical interpretations; for the truth then is seen to be that words addressed to one age have their fitness for all; and that these epistles are the heritage of the Church in every epoch. In this sense the churches are types and representatives of the whole family of God. Every community may find its likeness here. This much is admitted by the best commentators of all schools. "The seven churches," says St. Chrysostom, "are all churches by reason of the seven Spirits." "By the seven," writes St. Augustine, "is signified the perfection of the Church universal, and by writing to the seven he shows the fulness of one." And the words, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches," 'are, as has been well observed, a direct intimation that some universal application of their teaching was intended.<p><span class= "bld">Grace be unto you, and peace.</span>--Three apostles, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. John, adopt the same salutation. Not only is this a kind of link of Christian fellowship between them, but its adoption by St. John, after St. Paul had first used it, is a slight token that the Apocalypse cannot be regarded (as some recent critics would have it) as an anti-Pauline treatise. As the Christian greeting, it transcends while it embraces the Greek and Hebrew salutations. There is no tinge of the sadness of separation; it is the greeting of hope and repose, grounded on the only true foundation of either, the grace of God, which is the well-spring of life and love.<p><span class= "bld">From him which is, and which was, and which is to come</span> (or, <span class= "ital">which cometh</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>--The phrase presents a remarkable violation of grammar; but the violation is clearly intentional. It is not the blunder of an illiterate writer; it is the deliberate putting in emphatic form the "Name of Names." "Should not," says Professor Lightfoot, "this remarkable feature be preserved in an English Bible? If in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm" title="And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shall you say to the children of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.">Exodus 3:14</a> the words run, 'I AM hath sent me unto you,' may we not also be allowed to read here, from 'HE THAT IS, AND THAT WAS, AND THAT IS TO COME?'" The expression must not be separated from what follows. The greeting is triple: from Him which is, and which was, and which cometh; from the seven Spirits; and from Jesus Christ--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from the Triune God. The first phrase would therefore seem to designate God the Father, the self-existing, eternal One, the fount and origin of all existence. Professor Plumptre suggests that the phrase used here may be used in allusion and contrast to the inscription spoken of by Plutarch, on the Temple of Isis, at Sais: "I am all that has come into being, and that which is, and that which shall be; and no man hath lifted my vail." The heathen inscription identifies God with the universe, making Him, not an ever-being, but an ever-becoming, from whom personality is excluded: the Christian description is of the personal, everlasting, self-revealing God--who is, who was, and who <span class= "ital">cometh.</span> We should have expected after "is" and "was" "will be;" but there is no "will be" with an eternal God. With Him all <span class= "ital">is;</span> so the word "cometh" is used, hinting His constant manifestations in history, and the final coming in judgment. This allusion to the Second Coming is denied by Professor Plumptre, but as he admits that the words, "He that cometh," used in the Gospels, and applied by the Jews to the Messiah, may be designedly employed here by the Apostle, it is difficult to see how the Advent idea can be excluded. The word appears to imply that we are to be always looking for Him whose "comings" recur in all history as the earnests of the fuller and final Advent.<p><span class= "bld">From the seven Spirits.</span>--The interpretation which would understand these seven Spirits to be the seven chief angels, though supported by names of great weight, is plainly untenable. The context makes it impossible to admit any other meaning than that the greeting which comes from the Father and the Son comes also from the Holy Spirit sevenfold in His operations, whose gifts are diffused among all the churches, and who divides to every man severally as He will. For corresponding thoughts in the Old Testament, compare the seven lamps and seven eyes of Zechariah (<a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm" title="For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; on one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the engraving thereof, said the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.">Zechariah 3:9</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm" title="And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>), "the symbols of eternal light and all embracing knowledge." It may not be inappropriate to note that Philo speaks of the number seven in its mystical import as identical with unity, as unity developed in diversity, and yet remaining one. This unity in diversity is the thought St. Paul seems anxious to keep before the minds of the Corinthians, lest their gifts should become the source of division. All work that one and self-same spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1Corinthians 12:11</a>). The after-recurrence in this book of the number seven is, I think, selected to support this thought of completeness and variety; the dramatic unity is preserved, though the scenes which are unfolded are amply diversified; and the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven vials, are not three successive periods, but three aspects of one complete period presided over by that one Spirit whose guidance may be seen in all ages, and in diverse ways. The Spirits are before the throne. This reference to the throne gives a touch of authority to the description. The Holy Spirit who pleads with men is the Spirit from God's Throne. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">address and greeting.</span> Of this section only vers. 4-6 are, strictly speaking, the salutation; vers. 7, 8 constitute a kind of summary, or prelude - ver. 7 being more closely connected with what precedes, ver. 8 with what follows. The salutation proper (vers. 4-6) should be compared with the salutations in St. Paul's Epistles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">John</span>. Evidently some well-known John, otherwise some designation would be necessary. Would any but the apostle have thus written to the Churches of Asia? St. Paul had some need to insist upon his being an apostle; St. John lind none. <span class="cmt_word">To the seven Churches</span>. From the earliest times it has been pointed out that the number seven here is not exact, but symbolical; it does exclude other Churches, but symbolizes all. Thus the Muratorian Fragment: "John in the Apocalypse, though he wrote to the seven Churches, yet speaks to all." Augustine: "By the seven is signified the perfection of the universal Church, and by writing to seven he shows the fulness of the one." So also Bede: "Through these seven Churches he writes to every Church; for by the number seven is denoted universality, as the whole period of the world revolves on seven days;" and he points out that St. Paul also wrote to seven Churches. Compare the seven pillars of the house of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>), the seven deacons (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>), the seven gifts of the Spirit. The number seven appears repeatedly in the Apocalypse; and that it is arbitrary and symbolical is shown by the fact that there were other Churches besides these seven - Colossae, Hierapolis, Tralles, Magnesia, Miletus. The repeated formula, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches," proves that the praise and blame distributed among the seven are of universal application. <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span> means the Roman proconsular province of Asia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the western part of Asia Minor (comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace</span> be unto you, and peace. This combination occurs in the salutations of St. Peter and St. Paul. It unites Greek and Hebrew elements, and gives both a Christian fulness of meaning. <span class="cmt_word">From him which is</span>. Why should not we be as bold as St. John, and disregard grammar for the sake of keeping the Divine Name intact? St. John writes, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span> "If in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a> the words may run, 'I AM hath sent me unto you,' may we not also be allowed to read here, 'from HE THAT IS, AND THAT WAS, AND THAT IS TO COME'?" (Lightfoot, 'On Revision,' p. 133). Note the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span> to represent the nominative of the past participle of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not exist, and with the whole expression compare "The same yesterday, and today, and forever" (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Here every clause applies to the Father, not one to each Person; the three Persons are marked by the three prepositions, "from ... and from ... and from." It is a mistake to interpret <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> either of the mission of the Comforter or of the second advent. <span class="cmt_word">The seven Spirits</span>. The Holy Spirit, sevenfold in his operations (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>). They are <span class="cmt_word">before his throne</span>, ever ready for a mission from him (comp. <a href="/revelation/7-15.htm">Revelation 7:15</a>). The number seven once more symbolizes universality, plenitude, and perfection; that unity amidst variety which marks the work of the Spirit and the sphere of it, the Church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">John,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#969;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#333;ann&#275;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2491.htm">Strong's 2491: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Joannes, the name of four Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">To the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Tais)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Dative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
