The act of cursing God reflects a deep-seated rebellion and refusal to acknowledge His sovereignty, even in the face of divine judgment. The "God of heaven" is a title emphasizing God's supreme authority and power over all creation, contrasting with the earthly and temporal nature of human suffering. The "pains and sores" are likely a reference to the first bowl of wrath in <a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>, where those who worship the beast receive grievous sores. This mirrors the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, where Pharaoh's heart was hardened despite witnessing God's power. The refusal to turn to God in repentance, even when faced with suffering, underscores the depth of human sinfulness and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the end times.<p><b>Yet they did not repent of their deeds.</b><br>This phrase underscores the persistent unrepentance of humanity, even when confronted with clear evidence of divine judgment. The call to repentance is a central theme throughout the Bible, with God consistently offering forgiveness and restoration to those who turn from their sinful ways. The lack of repentance here fulfills the prophetic warnings found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>, where people are described as having eyes but not seeing, and ears but not hearing. This stubbornness is also seen in the New Testament, where Jesus laments over cities that witnessed His miracles yet refused to repent (<a href="/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-24</a>). Theologically, this highlights the concept of human free will and the tragic reality that some will choose to reject God despite His overtures of grace. The phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent sin and the importance of heeding God's call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_heaven.htm">God of Heaven</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator and Ruler of the universe, who is being blasphemed by those suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_suffering.htm">Those Suffering</a></b><br>Individuals experiencing the plagues and judgments described in Revelation, specifically those who refuse to repent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pains_and_sores.htm">Pains and Sores</a></b><br>Physical afflictions that are part of the divine judgments poured out upon the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The context of this verse is the outpouring of the bowls of God's wrath, a series of divine judgments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The act of turning away from sin and toward God, which the suffering individuals refuse to do.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_hardness_of_heart.htm">The Consequences of Hardness of Heart</a></b><br>Persistent refusal to repent leads to further spiritual and physical suffering.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_true_repentance.htm">The Nature of True Repentance</a></b><br>Genuine repentance involves a change of heart and action, not just regret over consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgments are just and serve as a call to repentance, even when they are severe.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_blasphemy.htm">The Danger of Blasphemy</a></b><br>Cursing God in times of suffering reveals a heart far from Him and invites further judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_repentance.htm">The Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>The time to repent is now, before judgment is fully realized and hearts are hardened beyond return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_16_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 16:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_11_Human_heart_s_hardness.htm">How does Revelation 16:11 illustrate the hardness of human hearts against God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_blasphemy_in_trials.htm">What actions can we take to avoid blaspheming God during trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_11_Romans_1_21_link.htm">How does Revelation 16:11 connect with Romans 1:21 on human rebellion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_repent_in_response_to_God_s_judgment.htm">Why is repentance crucial in response to God's judgments, as seen in Revelation 16:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_believers_guide_others_to_God.htm">How can believers encourage others to turn to God amidst suffering and pain?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_refuse_to_repent_in_Rev_16_11.htm">Why do people refuse to repent despite suffering in Revelation 16:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_11_Human_resistance.htm">How does Revelation 16:11 reflect human nature's resistance to change?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Revelation_16_11_God_s_judgment_mercy.htm">What does Revelation 16:11 reveal about God's judgment and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_16.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_order_of_melchizedek.htm">What is the meaning of the Lord's Prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_false_apostles.htm">What does the Bible say about false apostles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_was_the_biblical_prophet_micah.htm">What was God's purpose in creating the world?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_can_i_ensure_my_place_in_heaven.htm">How can I ensure my place in heaven?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Revelation 16:11 Mean</div><b>And blasphemed the God of heaven</b><p>&#8226; John records that during the fifth bowl judgment, people openly &#8220;blasphemed the God of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This is not a momentary outburst but deliberate, willful hostility toward the very One who is judging them (compare <a href="/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Much like Pharaoh who hardened his heart against the LORD despite escalating plagues (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>; 9:34), these individuals refuse to acknowledge God&#8217;s sovereignty.<p>&#8226; Their words reveal allegiance to the beast&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5&#8211;6</a>) and a total rejection of God&#8217;s rightful rule (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because of their pains and sores</b><p>&#8226; The immediate trigger for their blasphemy is physical agony: &#8220;their pains and sores.&#8221; These result from the first bowl, which produced &#8220;loathsome and malignant sores&#8221; on those who took the mark of the beast (<a href="/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of seeing the plagues as a wake-up call to turn to God (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6&#8211;11</a>), they treat Him as the enemy.<p>&#8226; This response mirrors earlier trumpet judgments where intense suffering still failed to produce repentance (<a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern underscores a sobering truth: suffering alone does not soften a heart; only humble submission to the Holy Spirit does (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet they did not repent of their deeds</b><p>&#8226; Even under unmistakable judgment, the people refuse to change course. &#8220;Deeds&#8221; points to a lifestyle of rebellion&#8212;idolatry, immorality, violence (<a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>; 18:3, 5).<p>&#8226; Their refusal fulfills prophecies that many will cling to wickedness when final judgments arrive (<a href="/daniel/12-10.htm">Daniel 12:10</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience has allowed ample opportunity for repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). What remains is righteous wrath on persistent unbelief (<a href="/revelation/14-9.htm">Revelation 14:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark: those sealed by God glorify Him amid trial (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9&#8211;12</a>), while the beast-marked curse Him even when His power is unmistakable (<a href="/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/16-11.htm">Revelation 16:11</a> shows hardened hearts at the height of the tribulation. The sufferers curse God instead of surrendering to Him. Their physical torment, far from producing repentance, exposes deep-rooted rebellion. Scripture warns that judgment without repentance leaves only further judgment. The verse calls readers today to examine their deeds, respond to God&#8217;s gracious invitations, and worship Him rather than resist Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores.</span> The expression, "God of heaven," seems to enhance the exaltation of God, and to place in more terrible contrast the sin of those who ventured to blaspheme One so high, so far above them.
