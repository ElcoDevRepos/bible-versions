The description "it was, and now is no more" suggests a past existence and a temporary absence, indicating a historical power that once was dominant but has since fallen. The "Abyss" is a term used in biblical literature to describe a place of confinement for evil spirits, suggesting that the beast's re-emergence is a supernatural event. The phrase "go to its destruction" indicates a predetermined end, aligning with biblical prophecies of ultimate judgment and defeat of evil forces, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a> and <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>.<p><b>And those who dwell on the earth whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will marvel when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet will be.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the reaction of the earth's inhabitants who are not part of the redeemed, as their names are not in the "Book of Life." This book is a metaphorical record of those who are saved, mentioned in other scriptures such as <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>. The phrase "from the foundation of the world" suggests the eternal nature of God's plan and foreknowledge. The marveling of those who dwell on the earth indicates a sense of awe or confusion at the beast's reappearance, reflecting a lack of spiritual insight or understanding. The repetition of "was, and is not, and yet will be" emphasizes the cyclical and deceptive nature of evil powers, echoing themes of false resurrection and imitation of Christ's eternal nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>Represents a powerful, evil entity or empire that opposes God.

"And to go" (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B. P, Vulgate, and almost all cursives; while <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he goeth," is found in A, 12, Arethas, Irenaeus. The latter part of this passage is related again in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>. <span class="accented">The beast</span>, as we have seen is the world power - Satan in his character of "prince of this world." Three stages are marked out in the existence of this world power: first, it <span class="accented">was</span>; second, it <span class="accented">is not</span> now; thirdly, it reappears, to be cast into perdition. The first period describes the condition of things before the sacrifice of Christ. Then it was that Satan ruled supreme in the world; that the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - was.</span> But Christ overcame the world (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); henceforth to all true believers there is "peace," although they may "have tribulation" in the world (<a href="/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>); for the faithful Christian the power of the world - <span class="accented">the beast - is not.</span> Yet, though for the true servant of God there is a sense in which it may be said that this power has no existence, it nevertheless exists in the abyss, that is, in its natural abiding place in the world, among the worldly minded, and thus may cause "tribulation" to the faithful. A further downfall is, therefore, prepared for it - that which will take place at the last day, when it "will ascend from the abyss to go into perdition." This nonexistence, contemporaneously with existence and subsequent reappearance, is exactly what is described in the wound healed (<a href="/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3</a>; see also the remainder of this verse). The period, therefore, embraced in these words is that of the whole existence of this world. It coincides with the period referred to in <a href="/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a> and 17, and in <a href="/revelation/20-3.htm">Revelation 20:3</a>. Throughout the Apocalypse the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, translated "bottomless pit" (Authorized Version) and "abyss" (Revised Version), is used to describe the dwelling place of Satan (see <a href="/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>) while working in the world. "Perdition" is described in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> as the "lake of fire burning with brimstone." <span class="cmt_word">And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is;</span> <span class="accented">whose name hath not been written upon the book</span>... <span class="accented">beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall be present.</span> The last words show exactly what is meant in the first part of the verse (which see).
