Angels often serve as messengers of God, and their presence in Revelation signifies divine intervention and communication. The sun, a symbol of God's glory and righteousness, highlights the angel's role in executing God's judgment. This scene connects to other biblical passages where angels are depicted as executing God's will, such as in <a href="/daniel/10.htm">Daniel 10</a> and <a href="/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-3</a>.<p><b>and he cried out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice signifies urgency and authority, ensuring that the message is heard by all intended recipients. In biblical literature, a loud voice often accompanies divine proclamations or significant announcements, as seen in <a href="/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a> and <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. This emphasizes the importance of the message being delivered and the power behind it.<p><b>to all the birds flying overhead</b><br>Birds are often used in scripture as symbols of God's creation and as agents in His plans. In this context, the birds are called to participate in the aftermath of divine judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>, where birds and beasts are summoned to feast on the fallen after God's victory over His enemies. The birds' presence underscores the completeness of God's judgment and the inevitability of His will being fulfilled.<p><b>&#8220;Come, gather together for the great supper of God</b><br>The "great supper of God" contrasts with the "marriage supper of the Lamb" mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>. While the marriage supper celebrates the union of Christ and His Church, the great supper of God represents the judgment and destruction of the wicked. This duality highlights the themes of salvation and judgment that run throughout Revelation. The invitation to the birds to gather for this supper signifies the finality of God's judgment and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel.htm">Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger standing in the sun, symbolizing authority and visibility.
