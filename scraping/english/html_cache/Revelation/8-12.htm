The trumpet judgments follow the seal judgments and precede the bowl judgments, indicating an intensifying sequence of divine retribution. The number four often symbolizes universality or completeness in biblical numerology, suggesting a widespread impact. Angels are frequently depicted as messengers or agents of God's will throughout Scripture, emphasizing the divine origin of these events.<p><b>and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck</b><br>The striking of the celestial bodies recalls the plagues of Egypt, particularly the ninth plague of darkness (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). This imagery suggests a divine intervention that disrupts the natural order, symbolizing judgment and chaos. The fraction "a third" indicates a partial, yet significant, impact, suggesting that God's judgment is severe but not yet total. The sun, moon, and stars are often associated with timekeeping and seasons (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-16</a>), and their disruption signifies a profound alteration in the created order.<p><b>A third of the stars were darkened</b><br>The darkening of the stars echoes prophetic imagery found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7-8</a>, where celestial disturbances are associated with the Day of the Lord and divine judgment. Stars are also symbolic of rulers or angels in biblical literature (<a href="/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>), and their darkening could imply a loss of authority or influence. This event underscores the theme of cosmic upheaval as a sign of God's sovereign intervention in human affairs.<p><b>a third of the day was without light</b><br>The absence of light for a third of the day parallels the darkness that fell over the land during Christ's crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>), symbolizing judgment and mourning. Light is a common biblical metaphor for God's presence and truth (<a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>), and its reduction signifies a withdrawal of divine favor or revelation. This partial darkness serves as a warning, urging repentance before more severe judgments occur.<p><b>and a third of the night as well</b><br>The extension of darkness into the night further emphasizes the comprehensive nature of this judgment. Nighttime is often associated with danger and evil (<a href="/john/11-10.htm">John 11:10</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:7</a>), and increased darkness heightens these associations. The dual impact on both day and night suggests a disruption of the natural rhythm of life, pointing to the pervasive consequences of sin and the need for divine intervention. This imagery reinforces the urgency of the call to repentance and the hope of restoration through Christ, the Light of the World (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fourth_angel.htm">The Fourth Angel</a></b><br>One of the seven angels who sound the trumpets, each bringing a specific judgment upon the earth.

Here, the trumpet signals a fresh judgment that impacts creation itself (<a href="/revelation/8-2.htm">Revelation 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Each angel acts only when commissioned, underscoring God&#8217;s complete control over the timing and intensity of every judgment (<a href="/job/38-12.htm">Job 38:12-13</a>; <a href="/psalms/148-1.htm">Psalm 148:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A third of the sun and moon and stars were struck</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Struck&#8221; points to a direct, miraculous blow from God, reminiscent of the plague of darkness in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Limiting the effect to &#8220;a third&#8221; shows measured mercy.

By striking the very lights He once hung in the sky, the Lord demonstrates unrivaled authority and calls a rebellious world to repentance while still restraining total devastation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And the fourth angel . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the fourth angel sounded, and there was smitten the third part of the sun</span>, <span class= "ital">and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; that the third part of them might be darkened, and the day might not appear as to its third part, and the night in like manner.</span> The dimness which thus falls on the lights of heaven carries us back to the plague of darkness (<a href="/context/exodus/10-21.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.">Exodus 10:21-23</a>); but yet there is this difference: there the children of Israel had light in their dwellings while all the rest of the land suffered the darkness that might be felt; here, however, the darkness is only such as results from the withdrawal of the third part of the light of the sun by day, and of the moon and the stars (so much more brilliant and needful in Eastern lands than in our own) by night. It is a day of the Lord in which the light is not clear nor dark--not day nor night (<a href="/context/zechariah/14-6.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>). There will be periods in which the lights which guide men will give forth uncertain glimmers; upon the earth there will be distress of nations, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken (<a href="/context/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25-26</a>). Such times of darkness and sorrow must be. It is through seasons such as these, when the lights of human wisdom and of spiritual guidance seem alike obscured, that the Church must go forward. The chaos precedes creation, and it is through chaos again that the Church of Christ must pass to the new heaven and new earth. These trumpet-visions, if read by the side of the story of Genesis, seem like the undoing of creation: the vegetation is smitten, the earth and sea are intermingled, the lights of the heavens are darkened, the living things in seas and streams are destroyed; but<p>"Fresher life the world shall draw<p>From their decay."<p>The pulling down must precede the building up; the removing of the degenerate is one step in the way to the regeneration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars</span>. Still the created universe is the direct object of these visitations. The planets were smitten, but we are not told with what instrument. As Alford points out, this may teach us not to lay too great stress upon that part of the visions which describes the means. Our attention is to be fixed upon the effect, the stroke, not upon the mountain or the star by whose means the result is attained. (For the signification of <span class="accented">the third part, vide supra.</span>) In the Bible, frequent use is made of this figure to express trouble and commotion (see <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The sun, etc., are also looked upon as examples of stability. Thus <a href="/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, "As long as the sun and moon endure" (see also <a href="/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>). The vision may therefore be suggestive of God's power over things the most permanent and stable, and thus demonstrate to Christians his ability to punish "the ungodly who prosper in the world." Thus <a href="/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a> attributes omnipotence to God, "which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and scaleth up the stars" (see also <a href="/psalms/136-8.htm">Psalm 136:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>). Thus, then, God can turn even the benign influences of the sun and planets into means for the destruction of man. In the countless evils which have their origin in the excess or defect of the power of the sun, we may see an illustration of the fulfilment of this judgment. We may point out that the very existence of such visitations as are here portrayed preclude the possibility of the fulfilment of the trumpet visions being subsequent in time to those of the seals. <span class="cmt_word">So as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise;</span> <span class="accented">that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.</span> Probably, total darkness for a third part of the day and night is meant; not a third of the usual amount of light during the whole day and night (as Bengel and others). Renan, as a preterist, sees the fulfilment in the eclipses of A.D. . De Lyra, Wordsworth, and others see in this judgment a symbol of the infidelity, heresies, apostasies, and confusions in the world in the seventh century and at other times. Vitringa, adopting the historical view, refers the fulfilment to particular periods of the Roman empire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/8-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
