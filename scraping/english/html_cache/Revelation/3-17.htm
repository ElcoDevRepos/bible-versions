Laodicea was a wealthy city known for its banking industry, textile production, and medical school, particularly famous for an eye salve. The church's claim of wealth and self-sufficiency mirrors the city's economic status. Biblically, this attitude is reminiscent of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, who stored up earthly treasures but was spiritually bankrupt. The Laodiceans' confidence in their material wealth led to spiritual complacency, a warning against the dangers of equating material prosperity with spiritual health.<p><b>But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.</b><br>This rebuke highlights the spiritual condition of the Laodicean church, contrasting their perceived self-sufficiency with their true spiritual poverty. The terms "wretched" and "pitiful" indicate a state of misery and neediness, despite their material wealth. "Poor" suggests a lack of spiritual riches, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a> about the blessedness of the poor in spirit. "Blind" connects to the city's famous eye salve, emphasizing their inability to see their true spiritual state. "Naked" signifies shame and vulnerability, reminiscent of Adam and Eve's realization of their nakedness in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>, symbolizing a loss of righteousness. This passage calls for self-examination and repentance, urging believers to seek true riches in Christ, as seen in <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>, where Jesus advises them to buy gold refined by fire, white garments, and salve to anoint their eyes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laodicea.htm">Laodicea</a></b><br>A wealthy city in Asia Minor known for its banking, textile, and medical industries.

Self-confidence says, &#8220;I have everything,&#8221; but Jesus&#8217; piercing eyes expose a church that is miserable, pitiable, bankrupt, blind, and unclothed. The passage calls believers to reject complacency, admit need, and seek true riches, sight, and covering found only in wholehearted fellowship with Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) I <span class= "bld">am rich.</span>--The verse means, more literally, <span class= "ital">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have grown rich, and in nothing have need, and knowest not that thou art the wretched</span> (such is the emphasis) <span class= "ital">one, and the pitiable one, and beggarly, and blind, and naked. </span>Thou art "the type, the embodiment of wretchedness." The words should, I think, be taken as an amplification of the reason for their rejection. Christ was about to reject them for being in that tepid state which, beginning with self-satisfaction, led on to self- deception. They were rich in worldly goods (unlike the Church in Smyrna), but their very wealth led them into a quiet unaggressively kind of religion; they were proud also of their intellectual wealth; self- complacent because in comfortable worldly circumstances, and became puffed up with a vain philosophy, they learned to be satisfied with their spiritual state, and to believe the best of themselves, and then to believe in themselves. Hypocrites they were, who did not know they were hypocrites. They thought themselves good; and this self-deception was their danger. "For," to use Prof. Mozley's words, "why should a man repent of his goodness? He may well repent, indeed, of his falsehood; but unhappily the falsehood of it is just the thing he does not see, and which he cannot see by the very law of his character. The Pharisee did not know he <span class= "ital">was</span> a Pharisee. If he had known it, he would not have been a Pharisee. The victim of passion, then, may be converted--the gay, the thoughtless, or the ambitious; he whom human glory has intoxicated; he whom the show of life has ensnared; he whom the pleasures of sense have captivated--they may be converted any one of these; but who is to convert the hypocrite? He does not know he is a hypocrite; he cannot upon the very basis of his character; he must think himself sincere; and the more he is in the shackles of his own character, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the greater hypocrite he is, the more sincere he must think himself" <span class= "ital">(University Sermons,</span> p. 34).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing</span>. The Epistle is still addressed indirectly to the Laodicean Church, directly to the angel. No doubt spiritual riches are immediately referred to; but spiritual pride and lukewarmness are frequently produced by worldly prosperity, such as that which Archippus (if he be the angel addressed; see on ver. 14) and the Church over which he presided enjoyed. It is not enough for the wealthy Christian to contribute a portion of his wealth, and then to consider his task done and his reward sure. Greater zeal than this is requisite before he can deem his duty discharged. Moreover, the greater the zeal that exists, the less will be the inclination to rely upon what has been accomplished, or to think it sufficient; for when all has been done we are still to call ourselves unprofitable servants (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>; cf. <a href="/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>, "I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin"). <span class="cmt_word">And knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked</span>; <span class="accented">and knowest not that thou, even thou thyself, art the wretched one.</span> The self-satisfied spiritual pride of the Pharisee caused him to regard with complacent pity the condition of the publican. But he was mistaken; he himself was <span class="accented">the wretched one</span>, who was to be pitied. So with the Laodicean Church. How different the conduct of St. Paul, who recognized his own wretchedness (<a href="/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>, where the same word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used)! The following words are adjectives. These Christians, in their spiritual pride, were <span class="accented">miserable -</span> deserving of pity; <span class="accented">poor</span> in the wealth accumulated by zeal in God's service; <span class="accented">blind</span> as to their real condition and their fancied spiritual safety; and <span class="accented">naked</span> of the cloak with which charity - fervent love of God - would have covered them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You say,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(legeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I am</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#956;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(eimi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
