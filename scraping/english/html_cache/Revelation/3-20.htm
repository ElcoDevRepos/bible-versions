The act of knocking indicates a desire for entry and relationship, emphasizing Jesus' initiative in seeking fellowship. In biblical times, a knock at the door was a common way to announce one's presence, and it required a response from within. This imagery is reminiscent of the <a href="/songs/5-2.htm">Song of Solomon 5:2</a>, where the beloved knocks, seeking entry. The door can be seen as the heart of the individual or the collective heart of the church, particularly the Laodicean church addressed in <a href="/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>. The urgency and persistence of the knock suggest a call to repentance and readiness.<p><b>If anyone hears My voice and opens the door,</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of a personal response to Jesus' call. Hearing His voice implies recognition and understanding of His message, which is consistent with the theme of spiritual awareness found throughout the New Testament. The act of opening the door signifies an act of will and acceptance, a decision to allow Jesus into one's life. This echoes <a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>, where the sheep hear the shepherd's voice and follow him. The invitation is universal ("anyone"), indicating that salvation and fellowship with Christ are available to all who respond.<p><b>I will come in and dine with him,</b><br>Dining together in the ancient Near East was a sign of intimate fellowship and acceptance. Meals were not just about sustenance but were social and relational events. Jesus' promise to dine with the one who opens the door signifies a deep, personal relationship. This is reminiscent of the Last Supper, where Jesus shared a meal with His disciples, symbolizing communion and covenant. The act of dining together also points to the eschatological banquet, the marriage supper of the Lamb, as described in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, where believers will enjoy eternal fellowship with Christ.<p><b>and he with Me.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes mutual fellowship and communion. The reciprocal nature of the relationship is highlighted, suggesting that the believer not only receives Christ but also shares in His presence and life. This mutual indwelling is a theme found in <a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>, where Jesus speaks of abiding in Him and He in them. It underscores the transformative nature of the relationship, where the believer is invited into a shared life with Christ, marked by ongoing fellowship and spiritual growth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, representing the divine presence seeking fellowship with believers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_of_laodicea.htm">The Church of Laodicea</a></b><br>The immediate audience of this message, known for its lukewarm faith, as described earlier in <a href="/bsb/revelation/3.htm">Revelation 3</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_door.htm">The Door</a></b><br>Symbolic of the heart or life of an individual, representing the barrier that must be opened to allow Christ's presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_knocking.htm">The Act of Knocking</a></b><br>Represents Christ's persistent invitation and desire for a relationship with individuals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_meal.htm">The Meal</a></b><br>Symbolizes intimate fellowship and communion with Christ, reflecting the cultural significance of shared meals in biblical times.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_initiative.htm">Christ's Initiative</a></b><br>Jesus takes the first step in seeking a relationship with us, demonstrating His love and desire for fellowship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_responsibility.htm">Personal Responsibility</a></b><br>While Christ knocks, it is up to each individual to respond by opening the door of their heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_christ.htm">Intimacy with Christ</a></b><br>The promise of dining together signifies a deep, personal relationship that goes beyond mere acquaintance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuous_invitation.htm">Continuous Invitation</a></b><br>Christ's knocking is persistent, indicating that His invitation is ongoing and available to all who will listen.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/transformation_through_fellowship.htm">Transformation Through Fellowship</a></b><br>Inviting Christ into our lives leads to transformation and spiritual growth as we commune with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_3_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 3:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_hear_His_voice_daily.htm">How can we "hear His voice" in our daily lives today?

Here it stresses that Christ&#8217;s appeal is not casual but eternally significant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I stand at the door</b><p>- The Lord is already present, not far off. <a href="/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a> reminds believers, &#8220;the Judge is standing at the door,&#8221; underscoring both nearness and accountability.<p>- Picture a homeowner discovering an unexpected Guest outside&#8212;Christ waits patiently yet firmly at the threshold of the human heart and the local church (cf. <a href="/luke/12-36.htm">Luke 12:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And knock</b><p>- Jesus initiates contact; He does not force entry.

He stands close, knocks repeatedly, speaks clearly, and waits for an opened heart. The moment we respond, He enters, shares an intimate meal, and establishes enduring communion. The verse calls every believer and church to decisive, personal receptivity, turning lukewarm religion into living relationship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I stand at the door, and knock</span>; <span class="accented">behold, I have stood</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">at the door, and am knocking</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>). "These gracious words declare the long-suffering of Christ, as he waits for the conversion of sinners (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>); and not alone the long-suffering which waits, but the love which seeks to bring that conversion about, which '<span class="accented">knocks</span>.' He at whose door we ought to stand, for he <span class="accented">is</span> the Door (<a href="/john/10-7.htm">John 10:7</a>), who, as such, has bidden <span class="accented">us to knock</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>; <a href="/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9</a>), is content that the whole relation between him and us should be reversed, and instead of our standing at his door, condescends himself to stand at ours" (Trench). The view, that <span class="accented">stand at the door</span> signifies "to come quickly" (Dusterdieck), as in <a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5, 16</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 11</a>, is scarcely in accordance with the context, since the whole passage has changed from rebuke and menace to patient beseeching and loving exhortation. These words recall the frequent use by our Lord of this figure of <span class="accented">knocking</span>, and especially <a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35, 36</a>, "Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately." If any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me (see the parallel passage in <a href="/songs/5.htm">Song of Solomon 5</a>.). Christ <span class="accented">knocks</span> and <span class="accented">speaks.</span> A distinction has been drawn in the work of conversion, corresponding to these two actions. The <span class="accented">knocking</span> is likened to the more outward calls of sickness, trouble, etc., by which he makes his presence known; while the <span class="accented">voice</span>, which interprets the knock and informs us of the Personality of him who knocks, is the voice of the Holy Spirit, speaking to us, and explaining the meaning of our trials. Man's free will is here well and plainly set forth. Though the opening, to be effective, needs the help and presence of Christ, yet he does not forcibly effect an entrance; it is still within the power of man to disregard the knock, to refuse to hear the voice, to keep the door fast shut. <span class="accented">To take food</span> with any one is an outward sign of brotherly love and reconciliation. Christ <span class="accented">will sup</span> with those who do not drive him away, and they <span class="accented">will sup</span> with him. The whole figure is an image of the perfect nature of the sinner's reconciliation with God, and of the wonderful goodness and condescension of Christ. But we may well see an allusion to the Holy Communion, by which we are reconciled to God through Christ, and by which we may even now have a foretaste of the final supper of the Lamb, which shall eventually last for ever. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#948;&#959;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(Idou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2400.htm">Strong's 2400: </a> </span><span class="str2">See!
