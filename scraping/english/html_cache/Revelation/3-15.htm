In biblical context, deeds often reflect the faith and commitment of believers (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a>). The reference to deeds suggests that the church's actions are under divine scrutiny, aligning with the broader biblical theme that God examines the hearts and actions of His people (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>you are neither cold nor hot.</b><br>The geographical context of Laodicea is significant here. The city was located near Hierapolis, known for its hot springs, and Colossae, known for its cold, refreshing waters. The metaphor of being neither cold nor hot suggests a spiritual lukewarmness, lacking the fervor and zeal expected of believers. This condition is often interpreted as spiritual complacency or indifference, which is condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>, <a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>).<p><b>How I wish you were one or the other!</b><br>This expression of desire indicates that a definitive spiritual state, whether cold or hot, is preferable to lukewarmness. Being "hot" could symbolize spiritual fervor and zeal, while "cold" might represent a state of being in need of spiritual awakening. The call for a decisive stance echoes the biblical theme of wholehearted devotion to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>).

He exposes the danger of settling for comfortable, half-hearted faith and calls His people to wholehearted allegiance. A fiery devotion glorifies Him; even outright rejection is clearer than complacency. The passage urges believers today to examine their works, reject lukewarmness, and pursue fervent, obedient fellowship with the Lord who knows and loves them perfectly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) <span class= "bld">Neither cold nor hot.--</span>The "heat" here is the glowing, fervent zeal and devotion which is commended and commanded elsewhere (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>). It is not, however, the self-conscious, galvanised earnestness which, in days of senile pietism, passes for zeal. It is an earnestness which does not know itself earnest, being all too absorbed in its work. It is self-forgetful, and so self-sacrificing, rather than ambitious of self-sacrifice. It is, in short, kindled of God, and sustained by<p>converse with the Divine One (<a href="/luke/24-32.htm" title="And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?">Luke 24:32</a>), and restored by intercourse with Him (see <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>; comp. <a href="/context/1_john/4-15.htm" title="Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in God.">1John 4:15-20</a>). The "cold" describes the state of those who are as yet untouched by the Gospel of Love. An intermediate state between these is the "lukewarm"; such are neither earnest for God nor utterly indifferent to religion. They are, perhaps, best described as those who take an interest in religion, but whose worship of their idol of good taste, or good form, leads them to regard enthusiasm as ill-bred, and disturbing; and who have never put themselves to any inconvenience, braved any reproach, or abandoned any comfort for Christ's sake, but hoped to keep well with the world, while they flattered themselves that they stood well with God; who were in danger of betraying their Master, Judas-like, with a kiss. With the denunciation of "lukewarmness" here we may compare the exhortation to greater ministerial earnestness addressed to Archippus (<a href="/colossians/4-17.htm" title=" And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.">Colossians 4:17</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - I know thy works; and because they are not what they should be (vers. 16, 17), I give thee this admonition, which is nevertheless a warning and a token of my love (ver. 19). That thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. The lukewarmness of which the Epistle complains was produced by a fallacious sense of security, begotten of ease and prosperity. In truth those "secure," without care, had become the careless ones. Active opposition may well be a less deadly evil than careless ease. The persecution of a St. Paul may be diverted into the zeal of an apostle; but how can any active good be got from that which is utterly stagnant and without motive power? The man who, by wilful action, increases a disease, may repent of his deed, and try to recover from the danger to which he has exposed himself; but he who lives on in careless ignorance of the existence of the malady can never improve himself until he has awoke to a full knowledge of his own state. Some understand "cold" to mean "untouched by the power of grace," and "lukewarm" to denote those who, having received the grace of God, had not allowed it full scope in bringing forth works meet for repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>). And just as there was more hope of the real conversion of the "cold" publicans and harlots, who "went into heaven" (<a href="/matthew/21-31.htm">Matthew 21:31</a>) before the self-satisfied, "lukewarm" Pharisees, so there is more hope of an unconverted sinner than of him who, having once been roused to a sense of God's will, has relapsed into a state of self satisfied indolence and carelessness. The sentence is <span class="accented">not</span> a wish that the Laodiceans should become hot or cold; it is a regret that they had not been one or the other. Our Lord is not wishing that any of them may become cold, but regretting that, when he comes to review their conduct and to pronounce judgment, many of them cannot even plead that they "knew not the way of righteousness," but belong to that worse class, "which after they had known it, turned from the holy commandment delivered unto them (<a href="/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>; see also <a href="/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7990;&#948;&#940;</span> <span class="translit">(Oida)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">your</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#959;&#965;</span> <span class="translit">(sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
