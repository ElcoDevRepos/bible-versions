The imagery of stars and lampstands is symbolic, with stars often representing heavenly beings or messengers, and lampstands symbolizing light and presence. The right hand signifies power and authority, indicating that the stars are under Christ's sovereign control. The lampstands, reminiscent of the menorah in the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-40</a>), symbolize the churches' role to be light-bearers in the world.<p><b>The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches:</b><br>The "angels" here can be interpreted as literal angelic beings assigned to each church, or as human messengers or leaders of the churches. The number seven is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The churches mentioned are located in Asia Minor, modern-day Turkey, and were real congregations facing specific challenges. The use of "stars" suggests guidance and protection, emphasizing the divine oversight of the churches.<p><b>and the seven lampstands are the seven churches:</b><br>The lampstands represent the seven churches addressed in Revelation chapters 2 and 3. Each church is called to be a light in its respective community, reflecting the light of Christ. The imagery of lampstands underscores the responsibility of the churches to maintain their witness and purity. This symbolism connects to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, where believers are called to be the light of the world. The presence of Christ among the lampstands (<a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>) assures His continual presence and support for the churches.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one revealing the vision to John, holding the seven stars and walking among the seven lampstands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_stars.htm">Seven Stars</a></b><br>Represent the angels or messengers of the seven churches.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_golden_lampstands.htm">Seven Golden Lampstands</a></b><br>Symbolize the seven churches in Asia Minor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_churches.htm">Seven Churches</a></b><br>The specific churches addressed in Revelation chapters 2 and 3, located in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_symbolism.htm">Understanding Symbolism</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of symbols in Revelation.

Here, the Lord Himself explains the symbols, underscoring that the vision is trustworthy and not subject to private interpretation (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By announcing the mystery, Jesus signals that what follows is meant for the churches&#8217; understanding and obedience (<a href="/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the seven stars you saw in My right hand</b><p>&#8226; John had just recorded that Christ &#8220;held seven stars&#8221; in His right hand (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The right hand, the place of power and security (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>; <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>), stresses Christ&#8217;s authority over these stars.<p>&#8226; Nothing&#8212;and no one&#8212;can remove what He holds. As He later repeats to Ephesus, He &#8220;holds the seven stars in His right hand&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>), reinforcing continual, active control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and of the seven golden lampstands</b><p>&#8226; John turned and &#8220;saw seven golden lampstands&#8221; with the Son of Man walking among them (<a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Lampstands evoke the tabernacle&#8217;s pure-gold menorah that burned continually before the Lord (<a href="/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31-37</a>).<p>&#8226; Gold highlights value; lamps convey light.

The verse assures believers of Christ&#8217;s sovereign protection, angelic help, and abiding presence, while reminding every congregation of its priceless calling to shine faithfully in a dark world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest</span> <span class= "bld">in my right hand.</span>--Having bidden him write the meaning of this mystery, or <span class= "ital">secret, </span>He gives to St. John an explanatory key: "The seven stars are angels of seven churches (or <span class= "ital">congregations</span>)<span class= "ital">:</span> and the seven candlesticks" (omit the words "which thou sawest") "are seven churches." The angels have been understood by some to be guardian angels; but it is difficult to reconcile words of warning and reproof (as in <a href="/context/revelation/2-4.htm" title="Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.">Revelation 2:4-5</a>), and of promise and encouragement (as in <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>), with such a view. More probable is the view which takes the angel to be the ideal embodiment (so to speak) of the Church. The more generally adopted view is that the angel is the chief pastor or bishop of the Church. The description of them as stars favours this view. Similar imagery is applied elsewhere to teachers, true and false (<a href="/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>; <a href="/jude/1-13.htm" title="Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.">Jude 1:13</a>. Comp. <a href="/revelation/8-10.htm" title="And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell on the third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of waters;">Revelation 8:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-4.htm" title="And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.">Revelation 12:4</a>). It is stated that the word "angel" was applied to the president in the Jewish synagogue. See, however, <span class= "ital">Excursus A.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mystery</span>. In construction this is the accusative after "write." A mystery is the opposite of a revealed truth; it is a sacred truth kept secret, the inner meaning of something which is perceived, but not generally understood. <span class="cmt_word">The angels of the seven Churches</span>. The meaning of these "angels" has been very much disputed. The common explanation that they are the bishops of the Churches is attractive on account of its simplicity. But it has very grave difficulties, especially for those who assign the Apocalypse to the earlier date of A.D. . It is highly improbable that at that very early time the seven Churches were already so fully organized as each to possess its own bishop. And granting that they were, and that the bishops might fitly be called "angels" or "messengers," would they not be called messengers of God or of Christ, rather than messengers of the Churches"? And would not the primitive Church have preserved this title as a synonym for "bishop"? "St. John's own language gives the true key to the symbolism. 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven Churches.' This contrast between the heavenly and the earthly fires - the star shining steadily by its own inherent eternal light, and the lamp flickering and uncertain, requiring to be fed with fuel and tended with care - cannot be devoid of meaning. The star is the suprasensual counterpart, the heavenly representative; the lamp, the earthly realization, the outward embodiment. Whether the angel is here conceived as an actual person, the celestial guardian, or only as a personification, the idea or spirit of the Church, it is unnecessary for my present purpose to consider. But whatever may be the exact conception, he is identified with and made responsible for the Church to a degree wholly unsuited to any human officer. Nothing is predicated of him which may not be predicated of it. To him are imputed all its hopes, its fears, its graces, its shortcomings, he is punished with it, and he is rewarded with it ... Nor is this mode of representation new. The 'princes' in Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20, 21</a>) present a very near if not an exact parallel to the angels of the Revelation" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Philippians,' p. 198). The identification of the angel of each Church with the Church itself is shown in a marked way by the fact that, although each epistle is addressed to the angel, yet the constantly recurring refrain is, "Hear what the Spirit saith <span class="accented">to the Churches,"</span> not "to the <span class="accented">angels</span> of the Churches." The angel and the Church are the same under different aspects: the one is its spiritual character personified; the other is the congregation of believers who collectively possess this character. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[This is] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(to)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
