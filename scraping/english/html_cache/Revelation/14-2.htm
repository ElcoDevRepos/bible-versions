The sound from heaven suggests a heavenly origin, emphasizing the authority and purity of the message. In biblical context, hearing from heaven often signifies God's direct communication, as seen in instances like the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p><b>like the roar of many waters</b><br>The imagery of many waters is often used in Scripture to describe the voice of God, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>. This metaphor conveys power, majesty, and overwhelming presence. The sound of many waters can also symbolize the multitude of voices or the collective praise of the redeemed, reflecting the vastness and unity of God's people.<p><b>and the loud rumbling of thunder</b><br>Thunder is frequently associated with God's presence and judgment throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. It signifies awe, power, and the seriousness of divine pronouncements. This imagery underscores the authority and might of the message being revealed.<p><b>And the sound I heard was like harpists strumming their harps</b><br>The mention of harps suggests a harmonious and worshipful element to the sound. Harps are often associated with praise and worship in the Bible, as seen in the Psalms and in the worship practices of the temple.
