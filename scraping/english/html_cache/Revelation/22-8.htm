This personal testimony underscores the authenticity and authority of the message. John, the apostle, is traditionally understood to be the same John who was one of Jesus' closest disciples, which adds weight to his account. His experience of hearing and seeing aligns with the prophetic tradition of receiving divine revelation, similar to prophets like Daniel and Ezekiel.<p><b>And when I had heard and seen them,</b><br>The repetition of "heard and seen" highlights the sensory and experiential nature of John's revelation. This phrase indicates the culmination of the visions that began in <a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, where John is instructed to write what he sees. The comprehensive nature of his experience is emphasized, suggesting that the visions are both auditory and visual, providing a full revelation of God's plan.<p><b>I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things.</b><br>John's reaction of falling down to worship reflects a common biblical response to divine or angelic encounters, seen in figures like Daniel (<a href="/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). However, this act of worship is misplaced, as angels are not to be worshipped. This incident serves as a reminder of the distinction between Creator and creation, reinforcing the biblical teaching that worship is due to God alone. The angel's role as a messenger is highlighted, pointing to the importance of discerning the proper object of worship. This moment also reflects the overwhelming nature of the revelation John received, which led to a spontaneous, albeit incorrect, act of reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john.htm">John</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the Book of Revelation, who received visions from God while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel.htm">Angel</a></b><br>A messenger of God who reveals the visions to John.

This self-identification anchors the vision in an eyewitness testimony, echoing <a href="/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a> where John speaks of what he has &#8220;heard&#8221; and &#8220;seen.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God often entrusts prophecy to specific, chosen servants (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). Because John is a faithful witness, the church can receive the book&#8217;s contents with full confidence in their accuracy (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>am the one who heard and saw these things</b><p>&#8226; John emphasizes both hearing and seeing&#8212;a double confirmation that the revelation is factual, not imaginative. Compare with <a href="/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>, where Daniel is told to &#8220;seal up the vision&#8221; he has seen.<p>&#8226; This dual sensory experience models how God communicates: through His Word to the ears (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>) and through visions to the eyes (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;These things&#8221; refers to the sweeping panorama of chapters 1&#8211;22: the letters to the churches, the seals, trumpets, bowls, the millennium, the new heaven and earth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when I had heard and seen them</b><p>&#8226; The past-tense reflection marks the close of John&#8217;s visionary journey. Like Ezekiel after his visions (<a href="/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14&#8211;15</a>), John is overwhelmed by the grandeur of what he has witnessed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a> shows a similar reaction: &#8220;When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead&#8221;. Such responses reveal the proper human reaction to divine disclosure&#8212;holy awe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I fell down to worship</b><p>&#8226; Falling prostrate is a common biblical posture of reverence (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-6.htm">Matthew 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s impulse shows sincere devotion, yet it is misdirected. Worship belongs to God alone (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The intensity of John&#8217;s reaction underlines the glory of the message&#8212;not merely the messenger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the feet of the angel who had shown me these things</b><p>&#8226; Angels are fellow servants (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Earlier, a similar scene occurred in <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a> where the angel corrected John: &#8220;Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you&#8230; Worship God!&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a> warns against &#8220;worship of angels.&#8221; John&#8217;s mistake serves as a living illustration of that warning.<p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s presence authenticates the heavenly origin of the prophecy (<a href="/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11&#8211;19</a>) while simultaneously underscoring that even the most glorious created beings are not worthy of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John, the trustworthy apostle, testifies that he both heard and saw God&#8217;s climactic revelation. Overwhelmed, he instinctively falls in worship, but at the wrong object&#8212;the angelic messenger. The scene teaches that:<p>1. Scripture&#8217;s visions are literal truths witnessed by reliable servants.<p>2. Authentic encounters with God evoke profound humility.<p>3. Worship must be directed to God alone; even magnificent angels are only fellow servants.<p><a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8</a> therefore functions as both a seal of eyewitness authenticity and a caution against misdirected devotion, calling believers to reserve all worship for the Lord who authored the prophecy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And I John saw these things . . .</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">And I John am he who hears and sees these things.</span> The words of the angel are confirmed by the words of Christ. Now we have the confirmatory testimony of the seer to the truth of the vision. The declaration reminds us of the opening of the Epistle of St. John: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you" (<a href="/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1-3</a>). It is no mere dream or ingenious fancy of his own that he has recorded; it is a veritable revelation.<p><span class= "bld">And when I had heard . . .</span>--Or better, <span class= "ital">When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who was showing me these things.</span> Wonder and awe took possession of the seer, and for the second time he was about to offer unlawful homage to the angel-minister. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>.) This twice offered and twice refused worship is full of teaching. To render to all their due is wise and seemly and Christ-like; to offer exaggerated homage to any is to invert God's order, and to degrade by pretending to exalt man, whose true glory is that he is God's creation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I John saw these things, and heard them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and I John</span> [<span class="accented">am</span>] <span class="accented">the</span> [one] <span class="accented">hearing and seeing these things.</span> The absence of the verb (the present participle being used alone) indicates the person to whom the revelation is made, without assigning any specific period as the particular time when the revelation took place. The same statement is made in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> (which see). "These things" are all that have been related in the book. <span class="cmt_word">And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things;</span> <span class="accented">and when I heard and saw</span>, etc. The tense here becomes aorist (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). St. John has once before fallen into the same error, viz. that of paying undue homage to the angel (see on Revelation 19:10). The beatific vision overwhelms him with awe, and he is bowed down with his own humility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/22-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And I [am]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#7936;&#947;&#8060;</span> <span class="translit">(Kag&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2504.htm">Strong's 2504: </a> </span><span class="str2">To also, I too, but I.
