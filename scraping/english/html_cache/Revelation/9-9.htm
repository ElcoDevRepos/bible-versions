In biblical times, iron was a symbol of strength and durability, often used in warfare. The imagery of breastplates indicates protection and readiness for battle, reflecting the spiritual warfare theme prevalent in Revelation. The use of iron may also allude to the Roman military, known for their iron armor, suggesting a powerful and relentless force. This imagery connects to <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a>, where believers are encouraged to wear the "breastplate of righteousness," highlighting the spiritual armor needed to withstand evil.<p><b>and the sound of their wings was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle</b><br>The sound described here is overwhelming and terrifying, evoking the chaos and intensity of ancient warfare. Horses and chariots were symbols of military power and speed in the ancient world, often associated with swift and decisive victories. This imagery may remind readers of the Old Testament, where horses and chariots are frequently mentioned in the context of battle (e.g., <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>, <a href="/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>). The comparison to the roar suggests an unstoppable force, emphasizing the destructive power of these creatures.

In <a href="/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a> the fourth kingdom is &#8220;as strong as iron,&#8221; crushing all things; so these locusts seem unstoppable until God&#8217;s purpose is complete.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/15-12.htm">Jeremiah 15:12</a> reminds us, &#8220;Can anyone break iron...?&#8221; The implication is that no earthly defense will blunt this judgment.<p>&#8226; God sets strict limits&#8212;only five months, and no fatal wounds (<a href="/revelation/9-5.htm">Revelation 9:5</a>). Yet within those limits the torment is as solid and unavoidable as iron.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the sound of their wings</b><p>&#8226; The noise captures the terror before the actual sting arrives. <a href="/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a> describes the cherubim&#8217;s wings sounding &#8220;like the voice of God Almighty.&#8221; These locusts parody that majesty, broadcasting fear instead of glory.<p>&#8226; Noise precedes conquest in several Old Testament scenes (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>).

Their armor reveals invulnerability, their iron composition speaks of inescapable judgment, their deafening wings spread terror, and their horse-and-chariot roar communicates unstoppable force. All of it underscores God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty: He alone releases, directs, and finally restrains these agents of wrath, urging a rebellious world to repent while there is still time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron.</span> Again, a natural feature of the locust is specifically alluded to, in order to portray the terrible nature of their appearance.
