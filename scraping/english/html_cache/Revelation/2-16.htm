In the context of Revelation, this call is directed to the church in Pergamum, which was struggling with false teachings and moral compromise. Repentance is a necessary response to sin, aligning with the messages of the prophets in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>) and the teachings of Jesus (e.g., <a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). The urgency of the command underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate action.<p><b>Otherwise I will come to you shortly</b><br>This phrase indicates the imminent nature of Christ's intervention if the church fails to repent. The concept of Christ coming to a church or individual is not necessarily about the Second Coming but can refer to a temporal judgment or correction. The use of "shortly" suggests that the consequences of failing to repent will be swift. This echoes the warnings given to other churches in Revelation, such as Ephesus (<a href="/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>), where Christ threatens to remove their lampstand if they do not repent.<p><b>and wage war against them</b><br>The imagery of waging war is symbolic of divine judgment and is consistent with Old Testament depictions of God as a warrior (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). In the context of Revelation, this war is not physical but spiritual, targeting the false teachings and practices within the church. The "them" refers to those within the church who are leading others astray, similar to the false prophets and teachers warned against in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>).<p><b>with the sword of My mouth.</b><br>The sword is a metaphor for the Word of God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, where it is described as living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword. In Revelation, the sword from Christ's mouth symbolizes His authoritative and powerful word of judgment (<a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>). This imagery highlights the power of Christ's words to discern truth from falsehood and to execute judgment. It also connects to the prophetic vision of the Messiah in <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where He strikes the earth with the rod of His mouth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, addressing the church in Pergamum.
