The imagery of the dragon is symbolic of chaos and opposition to God. The dragon's lack of strength signifies the ultimate defeat of evil forces against divine power. This echoes the theme of spiritual warfare found throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where believers are reminded that their struggle is not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces of evil. The dragon's defeat is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the serpent's head is crushed by the seed of the woman, symbolizing Christ's victory over Satan.<p><b>and no longer was any place found in heaven for him</b><br>This indicates the expulsion of Satan from heaven, a significant event in the cosmic battle between good and evil. The idea of being cast out of heaven is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12-17</a>, which describe the fall of Lucifer. Theologically, this expulsion represents the cleansing of heaven from sin and rebellion, aligning with the holiness and justice of God. It also signifies a shift in the spiritual realm, where Satan's access to accuse believers before God, as seen in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-12</a>, is revoked.<p><b>and his angels</b><br>The mention of "his angels" refers to the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion against God. These beings are often identified as demons in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a>, where eternal fire is prepared for the devil and his angels. The expulsion of these angels from heaven underscores the complete defeat of the rebellious forces. This event is part of the broader narrative of God's redemptive plan, where Christ's victory ensures the ultimate restoration of creation, free from the presence of evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dragon.htm">The Dragon</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the adversary of God and His people.
