His anger towards the woman, who symbolizes Israel or the people of God, reflects the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil. This enmity echoes <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where God declares enmity between the serpent and the woman, foreshadowing the conflict between Satan and God's people.<p><b>and went to make war with the rest of her children</b><br>The "rest of her children" refers to believers in Christ, the spiritual offspring of the woman. This phrase highlights the persecution faced by Christians, a theme consistent with the New Testament's portrayal of the early church's struggles. Historically, the Roman Empire's persecution of Christians serves as a backdrop, but the phrase also points to a broader, ongoing spiritual warfare against believers.<p><b>who keep the commandments of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the faithfulness and obedience of true believers. Keeping God's commandments is a hallmark of genuine faith, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where Jesus says, "If you love me, keep my commandments." It underscores the call for Christians to live according to God's will, despite opposition.<p><b>and hold to the testimony of Jesus</b><br>Holding to the testimony of Jesus signifies maintaining faith in Christ and proclaiming His gospel. This testimony is central to Christian identity and mission, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>, where John bears witness to the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. It reflects the believers' commitment to Christ amidst trials.<p><b>And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea</b><br>The sea often symbolizes chaos and evil in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2-3</a>, where beasts emerge from the sea. The dragon standing on the shore suggests a position of readiness to unleash further chaos and opposition. This imagery sets the stage for the subsequent chapters in Revelation, where the dragon's allies, the beasts, rise from the sea and the earth, intensifying the spiritual conflict.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dragon.htm">The Dragon</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the adversary of God and His people.

This involves both proclaiming the gospel and living a life that reflects Christ's teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_in_persecution.htm">Endurance in Persecution</a></b><br>The dragon's war against the woman's children serves as a reminder that persecution is a reality for believers.

His fury erupts because the &#8220;woman&#8221; (introduced in 12:1&#8211;6) has just been rescued by God (12:14&#8211;16).<p>- The woman represents the covenant people through whom Messiah came (cf. <a href="/genesis/37-9.htm">Genesis 37:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/66-7.htm">Isaiah 66:7&#8211;8</a>). Satan&#8217;s rage echoes the ancient hostility predicted in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and seen in attacks such as Pharaoh&#8217;s slaughter of Hebrew infants (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15&#8211;22</a>) and Herod&#8217;s massacre in Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16&#8211;18</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s preservation of the woman underscores His faithfulness to Israel even during intensified tribulation (<a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35&#8211;37</a>; <a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went to make war with the rest of her children</b><p>- Thwarted in one arena, the dragon shifts strategy. &#8220;War&#8221; signals organized, relentless persecution (<a href="/daniel/7-21.htm">Daniel 7:21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>- &#8220;The rest&#8221; points to a remnant still exposed after the woman&#8217;s flight. It mirrors Jesus&#8217; warning, &#8220;They will hand you over to persecution&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-9.htm">Matthew 24:9</a>).<p>- Throughout Scripture, Satan&#8217;s pattern is the same: when he cannot destroy the source, he targets the offspring (<a href="/esther/3-6.htm">Esther 3:6</a>; <a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus</b><p>- Two marks identify these believers:<p>&#8226; Obedient living&#8212;&#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).

His standing on the seashore foreshadows a fresh wave of opposition through earthly powers. Yet the passage assures readers that God preserves His people, fulfills His covenant promises, and ultimately limits the dragon&#8217;s reach. The call is clear: steadfast obedience and unwavering testimony, knowing that victory is certain because the Lord who rescued the woman will also keep her children.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And the dragon . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the</span> <span class= "ital">dragon was wroth with the woman, and departed</span> (not merely "went," but <span class= "ital">departed, </span>as one baffled in his attempt to carry the woman away by the river) <span class= "ital">to make war with the rest of her seed, who Keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus.</span> Omit the word Christ. The attempt to sweep away the Christian Church is vain. The wrath of man has always been found to turn to God's praise; the earth has always helped the woman; out of a thousand seeming defeats the Church of Christ has arisen; the banner of the Lord has been lifted up over every flood. But the foe will not give up his attacks. He can make war upon individual Christians; he may cease to assail the collective Church of Christ, but he can assail Christians by a thousand discomforts, by petty opposition, by undermining their morals, by making them unpopular, not as Christians, but as "very particular" Christians: for those thus assailed are they who "keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus." It is the old combination of a holy life and a fidelity to their Master which is the test of true loyalty. They take heed to themselves; they abide in Christ; they take heed to the teaching, that Christ's word may abide in them. They keep His word, and they witness to Him in lip and life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed;</span> <span class="accented">waxed wroth</span>... <span class="accented">went away to make</span>, etc. (Revised Version). Having failed to prevent the mission of' the man child - Christ Jesus - and having been foiled in his attempts to overwhelm the Church of God, Satan proceeds to attack the individual members of the Church - the seed of the woman. The method by which he endeavours to do this is related in the following chapters. Wordsworth points out an analogy between the means which Satan employs to destroy the Church as described here, and those described in the seals. The "rest of her seed" (Revised Version) signifies all the children of the woman, excluding the man child of ver. 5. All members of the Church of God are thus referred to, those who are brethren of Christ (cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>, "For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"). <span class="cmt_word">Which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</span> (nearly all manuscripts omit "Christ"); <span class="accented">hold the testimony</span> (Revised Version). This plainly points out who are the "rest of the seed" - they are those who are God's faithful servants. We may see in the description a reference to the Church of God, both Jewish and Christian. The members of the Jewish Church were they to whom "the commandments of God" were specially revealed, and Christians are they who specially "hold the testimony of Jesus." (For an explanation of the latter phrase, see on Revelation 1:2.) We have now reached another stage in the history of the warfare carried on by the devil against God. Vers. 7-12 of this chapter describe the origin of the hostility of Satan towards God; vers. 4 and 5 relate the attempts of the devil to destroy Christ and to thwart his mission; vers. 13-16 refer to the attacks of Satan upon the Church of God, by which he hoped to destroy it as a whole, before there was time for the "seed" to spring up. Having failed in every attempt, the dragon now sends other agents by whom he hopes to destroy the individual members of the Church - the other seed of the woman - the brethren of Christ. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
