The opening of the seals is a continuation of the vision given to John, where the Lamb is the only one worthy to open the scroll (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5-7</a>). The imagery of the Lamb emphasizes Christ's sacrificial role and His authority over the events of the end times. The seals represent stages of judgment, and the sixth seal introduces a series of cataclysmic events.<p><b>and there was a great earthquake</b><br>Earthquakes in biblical literature often symbolize God's intervention in human history (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51-54</a>). This great earthquake signifies a dramatic shift, possibly indicating the beginning of the end of the current age. Historically, earthquakes were seen as divine acts, and their inclusion here underscores the magnitude of the events being described. This earthquake is part of the apocalyptic imagery that conveys the severity of God's judgment.<p><b>and the sun became black like sackcloth of goat hair</b><br>The darkening of the sun is a common apocalyptic motif, symbolizing judgment and the withdrawal of God's favor (<a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>). Sackcloth, made from coarse goat hair, was traditionally worn in times of mourning and repentance (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>, <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). The comparison to sackcloth suggests a period of mourning and distress for the earth's inhabitants. This imagery may also connect to the plagues of Egypt, where darkness was a sign of God's power and judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>).<p><b>and the whole moon turned blood red</b><br>The transformation of the moon into blood is another apocalyptic sign, often associated with the Day of the Lord (<a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, <a href="/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>). This imagery conveys a sense of impending doom and the seriousness of divine judgment. The blood-red moon can symbolize both the shedding of blood and the urgency of repentance. In the cultural context, such celestial changes would have been seen as ominous signs, reinforcing the message of the coming judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is opening the seals of the scroll.

There He tells His disciples that wars (<a href="/revelation/6-6.htm" title="And I heard a voice in the middle of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see you hurt not the oil and the wine.">Revelation 6:6</a>), famines and pestilences (<a href="/revelation/6-7.htm" title="And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.">Revelation 6:7</a>), and persecutions (<a href="/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>) are to be expected; these are necessary features in the history of the world. But these features are described by our Master as preliminary to His Coming and the end of the world (<a href="/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>), and that when these had wrought their work then the Coming of the Son of Man would take place (<a href="/context/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29-31</a>). With this guide, it is impossible for us to deny that the opening of this sixth seal has reference to the Coming of the Son of Man, and finds its final and ultimate fulfilment in the day when He will come to gather His elect from the four winds. But it is not to be forgotten that our Lord wished us to regard certain great culminating epochs as in a secondary sense His advents. The eagles which swept down upon the carcase of any corrupt nationality were proofs of His reign and true shadows of His coming. The features indicated in the seals have a sequence which has been reproduced in the history of nations and churches. The promise of good; the breaking forth of the spirit of violence; the time of social misery, want, disease; the oppression of the good; revolution-- these have repeated themselves in Jewish, Roman, French, and other histories; and the prophecy is not exhausted yet.<p>(<span class= "ital">12-14</span>)<span class= "ital"> <span class= "bld">And I beheld . . .</span>--Better, And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, and (omit "lo!") a great shaking took place, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon all became as blood, and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a fig-tree casts its winter figs when shaken by a great wind, and the heaven departed like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. </span>It is well to keep in mind the parallel imagery of the Old Testament. The shaking ("earthquake" is hardly an adequate rendering, as the shaking extends to heaven as well as earth) was spoken of by Haggai: "Yet once for all" (not "once more," as in the English version) "shake I not the earth only, but also the heavens. And this word 'Once for all' signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken" (<a href="/haggai/2-6.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;">Haggai 2:6</a>, and <a href="/context/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.">Hebrews 12:26-27</a>). Sun black as sackcloth: Joel has a similar thought --"the sun shall be turned into darkness" (<a href="/context/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.">Joel 2:30-31</a>); and Isaiah,'' I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering" (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm" title="The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.">Isaiah 1:3</a>). The moon as blood is repeated from <a href="/context/joel/2-30.htm" title="And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.">Joel 2:30-31</a>. The falling of the stars of heaven has its parallel in <a href="/context/isaiah/34-3.htm" title="Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.">Isaiah 34:3-4</a>, "All the host of heaven shall be dissolved." As a fig-tree is an echo of <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm" title="And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falls off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.">Isaiah 34:4</a>. It will be seen by these passages how closely the writer of the Apocalypse has kept to Old Testament imagery; and that events, such as great calamities, changes, and revolutions in the world's history, are described by emblems similar to those used here. St. Peter, for example, illustrates the great spiritual revolution of the Day of Pentecost by the passage from Joel, "The sun turned into darkness and the moon into blood." Hence it seems right to regard the language here as figurative, and to bear in mind that, though its fullest application belongs to the final advent, there may be many anticipatory advents. The judgment is often rehearsed before the day of judgment; the ages of oppression end in a day of catastrophe and confusion in which the righteous laws of a righteous King avenge themselves on the law breakers; the old lights and landmarks are for a time obliterated, and feeble, but pretentious, religionists are swept off as autumn figs from the fig-tree, and the proud and mighty are dismayed; things come to a crisis, and men "are proven by the hour" of that judgment; the unripe or untimely fruit drops off, as those who have no root in themselves fall away, and as the feebly- founded house fell in the tempest (<a href="/context/matthew/7-26.htm" title="And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:">Matthew 7:26-27</a>). If this be so in the minor and preliminary crisis of the world, how much more so in the final crisis, which will try all? "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." The untimely figs, or unripe figs, are the grosses, or winter figs, which grow under the leaves, and do not ripen at the proper season, but hang upon the trees till the winter. They are a fit emblem of those who have not used the opportunity and season to ripen for God. Like the unwise virgins, they have not replenished their lamps with oil; or, to use the unique expression of St. Luke, they bring no fruit to perfection (<a href="/luke/8-14.htm" title="And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.">Luke 8:14</a>). The crisis thus puts the feeble, timid, and negligent to the test, and also proves the vanity of those who make any world-power their confidence. As the day of the Lord of which Isaiah spoke was upon every one that was proud and lifted up, upon the cedars and oaks, upon the towers and fenced walls, upon the loftiness and haughtiness of men, so does the Apocalyptic seer behold the dismay which falls upon every form of vain gloriousness, pretence, and pride. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal;</span> <span class="accented">and I saw when he opened.</span> The events described accompany the opening as in the case of the preceding visions (see on vers. 1, 3, 5, etc.). The sixth seal describes the end of the world - the transition of the saints from earth to heaven, with the accompanying circumstances. It is important to remember that the whole is a vision, and we must therefore guard against expecting a literal interpretation of the language used. Following the manner of the prophets, and the description given by our Lord himself of the judgment day, St. John portrays the wonder and awe and consternation which will then be prevalent under the figure of falling stars. etc. How much, if any, may, in the destruction of the world, literally come to pass, it is impossible to say; but we must be content to receive the general impression which is undoubtedly intended to be conveyed to us, without pressing the individual particulars too far. The symbolism, as usual, bears evidence of its Old Testament origin; and the influence of our Lord's description in <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>. is noticeable. The special revelation of God's presence or of his judgments is usually depicted under the figure of terrestrial commotion (see on Revelation 6:1; also <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>: <a href="/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7, 8</a>; <a href="/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>; <a href="/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>). The last three seals seem connected more especially with life in the next world. The fifth seal displays to us the souls of the faithful in peace, but desiring the perfect consummation of their bliss; the sixth announces the certainty of future judgment, when all will be set right, when the righteous will be preserved and the wicked justly recompensed; the seventh typifies the indescribable joy and peace of heaven. It seems reasonable, therefore, to consider the passage <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12-7:17</a> as all contained under the sixth seal; since, although set forth at rather greater length than the other seals, it all follows in natural sequence - the destruction of the earth, the fear of the wicked, the preservation and joy of the righteous; and then follows heaven, portrayed under the opening of the seventh seal. Some have tried to separate <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. as "an episode," or rather two episodes, commencing at, and marked off by, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of ver. 1 and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of ver. 9, "after these things." But this expression, though undoubtedly marking, the beginning of a fresh phase of the subject, does not necessarily imply the opening of an entirely new and unconnected discourse. This view of the sixth seal is in harmony with what appears to be the general plan of the visions of the seals. It is important to bear in mind, in our interpretation of the Apocalypse, these two principles - first, the book was addressed to certain Christians for a definite purpose, and its object would be set forth so as to be comprehended by them; second, the truths thus contained must be such as to be applicable to the position of mankind in general in all ages. We have, therefore, to inquire to whom and for what purpose the book was primarily written, and then how the lessons contained can benefit mankind in general. It thus appears that the message was originally intended as an encouragement and a support to those Christians who were being persecuted, and were suffering in various ways, and whose patience might be inadequate to preserve them through trials so severe or so long. The visions of the seals would speak plainly to such as these. The first four would tell them that, though they must not doubt of Christ's final victory, it is yet with God's knowledge and permission that this life is afflicted with troubles of different kinds; it is not because God is weak, forgetful, or unjust Then, lest any should be tempted to ask, "Is it worth while? If Christianity involves all this suffering, would it not be better to be as the world is, and escape?" a picture of the future is given. The fifth seal shows that, immediately upon the completion of this life, the souls of the righteous are at peace; and the sixth seal shows that a day of reckoning will certainly come for the world; while the seventh seal is an assurance of heaven. It <span class="accented">is</span> worth while, therefore, to endure and to persevere, both on account of God's reward to the just, and his retribution upon the unjust. Thus would the signification of the visions be easily comprehended by those for whom they were originally intended; and the same lessons are equally valuable for the Church at all time. Grotius considers that this vision refers to the destruction of Jerusalem; Elliott, Faber, and Mede refer its accomplishment to the beginning of the fourth century; Wordsworth sees the "last age" of the Church represented; Stern thinks it indicates the general state of the Church; Wetstein, the commotions in Judaea previous to the destruction of Jerusalem; while Cunninghame and Frere see a reference to the French Revolution of 1789. But these interpretations do not fulfil the conditions mentioned above, since the Christians to whom this book is addressed were ignorant of those events yet in the future. <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, there was a great earthquake.</span> Omit "lo." The earthquake is the usual manifestation of God's presence or special dealing with men (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This is the answer to the question of the saints in the fifth seal - the period of probation is finite. And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair. Thus <a href="/isaiah/50-3.htm">Isaiah 50:3</a>, "I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering" (cf. <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the moon became as blood;</span> <span class="accented">the whole</span> moon (cf. <a href="/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a>, quoted in <a href="/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
