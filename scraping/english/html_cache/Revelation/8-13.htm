The eagle is a symbol often associated with swiftness and judgment in biblical literature (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>, <a href="/hosea/8.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>). In the context of Revelation, the eagle's flight overhead signifies a message of impending doom that is urgent and unavoidable. The use of an eagle, a creature that soars high and sees far, emphasizes the divine perspective and authority of the message being delivered.<p><b>calling in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice indicates the importance and urgency of the message. In biblical narratives, a loud voice often accompanies divine proclamations or significant announcements (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>, <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). This ensures that the message is heard by all, underscoring its critical nature.<p><b>&#8220;Woe! Woe! Woe to those who dwell on the earth</b><br>The triple repetition of "Woe" intensifies the severity of the coming judgments. In Hebrew culture, repetition is a common literary device used to emphasize a point (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, "Holy, holy, holy"). The woes are directed at "those who dwell on the earth," a phrase often used in Revelation to refer to those who are opposed to God and His purposes (e.g., <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10, 6</a>:10). This sets a clear distinction between the faithful and the rebellious.<p><b>because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!&#8221;</b><br>The trumpet blasts are part of a series of judgments that unfold in Revelation. Trumpets in biblical times were used for signaling important events, such as war or the arrival of a king (e.g., <a href="/numbers/10-9.htm">Numbers 10:9</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm">1 Kings 1:34</a>). The remaining three angels signify that the most severe judgments are yet to come, building anticipation and warning of the escalating nature of God's wrath. This connects to the broader theme of Revelation, where God's ultimate justice and sovereignty are revealed through a series of escalating judgments leading to the final establishment of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eagle.htm">Eagle</a></b><br>In this passage, an eagle is seen flying in midair.

John&#8217;s watching eye, an eagle&#8217;s soaring cry, a triple &#8220;Woe,&#8221; and the looming final trumpets combine to declare that God&#8217;s judgments are real, escalating, and aimed at earthbound rebels. The passage urges every reader to heed God&#8217;s warning now, before the last three trumpets sound and the full weight of divine wrath arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">INTRODUCTION TO THE LAST THREE, OR WOE, TRUMPETS.

It flies through the meridian sky, and is thus visible to the very horizon. It was an appropriate emblem: high-soaring as the spirit of the seer, the eagle-glance scanned the borders of the earth, and caught sight of the coming troubles, and gave warning; swift and strong as the judgments of God, its very form gave emphasis to the warnings of its voice (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm" title="The LORD shall bring a nation against you from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flies; a nation whose tongue you shall not understand;">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.">Hosea 8:1</a>; and <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm" title="For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.">Matthew 24:28</a>). And yet the emblem must bring to the minds of God's children the care of Him who led Israel, instructed him, and kept him as the apple of His eye, and cherished him as "an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-11.htm" title="As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>). Is it not also a precursor of those eagle-like judgments which fall upon the carcase of dead nations or a dead society?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I beheld, and heard an angel.</span> "An eagle" (Revised Version) is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, etc., while "angel" is found in P, 1, 16, 34, 47, etc. One manuscript (13) has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. St. John sees <span class="accented">one eagle</span>, the symbol of what is swift and unerring in swooping upon its prey. Thus <a href="/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>, "The eagle that hasteth to the prey" (see also <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>). This is the meaning of the appearance of <span class="accented">the eagle</span>, which announces the swiftness and certainty of the coming woes. De Wette and others unnecessarily understand "an angel in the form of an eagle." De Lyra interprets it as St. John himself. Wordsworth, relying chiefly on the force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>, believes that Christ is signified; but it is extremely doubtful whether the force of the numeral can be pressed so far. Others see a reference to the Roman legions, etc. The figure may have been suggested by <a href="/matthew/24-28.htm">Matthew 24:28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Flying through the midst of heaven;</span> <span class="accented">flying in mid heaven</span> (Revised Version). Not "midway between earth and heaven," but "in the direct line of the sun." The word is found only here and in <a href="/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a> and Revelation 19:17. In the former it is rendered as in this place, in the latter it is translated "in the sun." The eagle is thus plainly visible to all. <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth!</span> "Woe" is followed by "inhabiters" in the accusative case, according to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B; though the dative is read in A, P, and some cursives. "The inhabiters of the earth" are the ungodly, the worldly, those on whom God's wrath had been invoked by the saints at rest (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>), whose prayer is now answered The triple denunciation renders the threatened judgments more emphatic and terrible. <span class="cmt_word">By reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound;</span> Greek, <span class="accented">out of the other voices</span> (denoting front whence the woe proceeds) <span class="accented">who are yet to sound.</span> "Trumpet," in the singular, because taken distributively - "of each trumpet."
