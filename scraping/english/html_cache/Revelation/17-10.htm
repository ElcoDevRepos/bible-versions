In biblical prophecy, "kings" often symbolize kingdoms or empires. The number seven is significant in Scripture, often representing completeness or perfection. This could suggest a complete series of world powers or a specific sequence of rulers. The context of Revelation, with its apocalyptic imagery, points to these kings as significant figures in the unfolding of God's plan.<p><b>Five have fallen,</b><br>This indicates that five of these kings or kingdoms have already passed away by the time of John's writing. Historically, this could refer to past empires that have had significant influence over Israel and the biblical narrative, such as Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, and Greece. Each of these empires played a role in the history of God's people and had fallen by the time of the New Testament.<p><b>one is,</b><br>The "one is" refers to the current power at the time of John's writing, which would be the Roman Empire. Rome was the dominant world power during the first century and had a significant impact on the early Christian church. This aligns with the historical context of Revelation, written during a time of Roman persecution of Christians.<p><b>and the other has not yet come.</b><br>This phrase points to a future kingdom or ruler that had not yet appeared at the time of John's writing. It suggests a prophetic element, indicating that there will be another significant power or leader in the future. This future entity is often interpreted as a final world empire or a specific end-times ruler in eschatological studies.<p><b>But when he does come,</b><br>This anticipates the arrival of the future king or kingdom. The language suggests an inevitability, emphasizing the certainty of prophetic fulfillment. This future ruler is often associated with the Antichrist in Christian eschatology, a figure who will oppose Christ and His followers.<p><b>he must remain for only a little while.</b><br>This indicates the temporary nature of this future ruler's reign. Despite the power and influence this king or kingdom may wield, it will be short-lived in the grand scope of God's eternal plan. This aligns with the biblical theme that earthly powers are transient and ultimately subject to God's sovereign will. The brevity of this reign offers hope to believers, affirming that evil will not prevail indefinitely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_kings.htm">Seven Kings</a></b><br>These represent a sequence of rulers or empires.

The passage reassures believers that every kingdom rises and falls under God&#8217;s plan, and even the final, frightening power will last &#8220;only a little while&#8221; before Christ returns to claim eternal dominion (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And there are seven kings. . . .</span>--Better. <span class= "ital">They are seven kings: five</span> (not "are fallen," but <span class= "ital">fell, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he shall come, he must continue a short time.</span> It has been debated whether these kings are individual sovereigns, or forms of government, or kingdoms The last view is the one adopted in this Commentary. The wild beast belongs to no one age, but is a power which has risen in every age; the seven heads represent the successive culminations of the world-power. Our space is insufficient to discuss here the whole question. But the language here used and the passages in the earlier prophets, which may be called the parent passages of the present vision, favour the interpretation that great world-kingdoms are intended. The language favours this view. It is said that the "kings fell." The word is the one which has been used for political catastrophe: the cities of the nations fell (<a href="/revelation/16-19.htm" title="And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.">Revelation 16:19</a>); Babylon, it is cried, has fallen (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm" title="And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.">Revelation 14:8</a>). It suits the overthrow of empires, and is so used in the LXX.; to apply it to individual kings is to ask that it shall be equivalent to "they died." It is to be noticed that the four beasts of Daniel (<a href="/context/daniel/7-3.htm" title="And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.">Daniel 7:3-8</a>) are declared to be four kings (<a href="/revelation/17-17.htm" title="For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.">Revelation 17:17</a>), but these kings are not individual kings, but represent kingdoms. (See <a href="/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23</a>). This brings us to the drift of the parent passage. Daniel saw four wild beasts rise from the sea; they represented the then great world-power Babylon, and its three successors, Persia, Greece, and Rome. This is a guide to us here, as most commentators admit; but two great world-powers had preceded Babylon, viz., Egypt and Assyria: these figure in the ancient prophecies as forces hostile to the righteous King. St. John, whose visions took the range of the world's drama, could not see the representative of the ever rising spirit of worldly hostility to God's chosen without seeing Egypt and Assyria included. The voices of Moses and Isaiah called to him across the centuries that in these the world principle of their day found its clearest and strongest manifestation. In various empires the world-power showed itself: in Egypt, the house of bondage (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.">Exodus 20:2</a>); in Assyria, that exalted herself against God (<a href="/isaiah/37-23.htm" title="Whom have you reproached and blasphemed? and against whom have you exalted your voice, and lifted up your eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 37:23</a>); in Babylon, the hammer of the whole earth (<a href="/jeremiah/50-23.htm" title="How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!">Jeremiah 50:23</a>); in Persia, and in Greece; and in succession these kingdoms fell, only to be succeeded by another--Rome. Five fell; the one is. But what is the seventh, the other who is not yet come? We must recall the appearance of the wild beast. It had seven heads and ten horns. Where were these ten horns? It seems generally admitted that they were all on the seventh head. The seventh head, which represents the seventh kingdom, or manifestation of the world principle which is described as not yet come, then, was different in appearance from the others. It was ten-horned. It had not the same unity of appearance as the others. Now the ten horns are explained as ten kings or minor powers (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm" title="And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.">Revelation 17:12</a>). The conclusion, therefore, is that the seventh head must be rather an aggregation of monarchies than a single universal empire. This agrees with Daniel's prophecy that out of the fourth kingdom, which corresponds, as we have seen, with the sixth head of the wild beast here, ten kings should arise (<a href="/daniel/7-7.htm" title="After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.">Daniel 7:7</a>; <a href="/context/daniel/7-23.htm" title="Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.">Daniel 7:23-24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there are seven kings;</span> <span class="accented">and they are.</span> Here we have the same idea (cf. ver 9), with a somewhat different aspect. The phrase in ver. 9, "seven mountains," regarded the world power as one universal indivisible whole, without respect to particular times or modes in which it might be exhibited. In this phrase, "seven kings," we have the same world power viewed in its successive exhibitions by different nations; though here again we must be on our guard not to interpret the number <span class="accented">seven</span> literally of seven nations. The <span class="accented">kings</span> represent Worldly states or kingdoms; <span class="accented">seven</span>, again, betokens universality. We are thus told that this world power on which the woman relies is exhibited in the manifestation of power by successive nations, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Egyptian, Assyrian, Roman, etc., as many as have ever existed or shall exist; for this is the meaning of <span class="accented">seven. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come;</span> <span class="accented">the five</span>; <span class="accented">the one</span>; <span class="accented">the other.</span> Omit "and." Here, again, not literally <span class="accented">five.</span> The seer divides the whole series of antitheistic world powers into three groups, and he would say, some, probably the majority, of these are passed away; the second group embraces the world power as it is exhibited now, whether Roman, Jewish, or any other; in the third group are included those yet to come. Thus those writers who enumerate Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Syria, etc., in the first group, are partially correct, and only wrong in so far as they attempt to limit and define the kingdoms; and similarly also those who in the third group place the Roman empire after the barbarian invasions, or imperial Germany, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And when he cometh, he must continue a short space;</span> a <span class="accented">little while</span> (Revised Version). This "short space" describes the remainder of the time of the world's existence.
