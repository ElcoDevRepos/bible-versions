This signifies God's presence and majesty. The smoke symbolizes the divine presence and holiness, indicating that God is about to execute judgment. In <a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>, the temple fills with smoke during Isaiah's vision, representing God's holiness and the seriousness of His message. The smoke also signifies God's power and glory, emphasizing His sovereignty and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence.<p><b>and no one could enter the temple</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of divine exclusivity, where God's presence is so overwhelming that no one can approach. It reflects the holiness and separateness of God, as seen in the Old Testament when only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year (<a href="/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a>). This restriction underscores the seriousness of the moment and the impending judgment. It also highlights the separation between God and humanity due to sin, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</b><br>The seven plagues represent the final judgments of God upon the earth, as detailed in <a href="/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating that these judgments are the full and final expression of God's wrath. The completion of these plagues signifies the end of God's patience and the fulfillment of His righteous judgment. This connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and the ultimate triumph over evil, as prophesied in various scriptures, including <a href="/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a> and <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21-22</a>.

When Isaiah saw the Lord &#8220;high and exalted,&#8221; the house was &#8220;filled with smoke&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-4.htm">Isaiah 6:4</a>). In each case, smoke visually signals that God Himself has arrived. Here in heaven&#8217;s temple, the same real, tangible cloud conveys:<p>&#8226;The nearness of God&#8212;His presence is not abstract but observable.<p>&#8226;The holiness of God&#8212;smoke veils what is too glorious for created beings to behold directly (<a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226;The divine initiative&#8212;just as at Sinai, the smoke emanates from God, not from human ritual (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the glory of God and from His power</b><p>The verse specifies that the smoke arises &#8220;from the glory of God and from His power.&#8221; Glory (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13&#8211;14</a>) and power (<a href="/psalms/29-4.htm">Psalm 29:4</a>) always belong together; His radiant splendor and His irresistible might are inseparable. This line reminds us:<p>&#8226;What fills the temple is not judgment itself but God&#8217;s own character.<p>&#8226;The coming plagues flow out of who He is&#8212;holy, just, omnipotent.<p>&#8226;The moment mirrors the dedication of Solomon&#8217;s temple when &#8220;the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>).<p>God&#8217;s glory is never sterile spectacle; it is dynamic power preparing to act (<a href="/revelation/11-17.htm">Revelation 11:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and no one could enter the temple</b><p>Access is suspended.

The shut door communicates:<p>&#8226;Separation&#8212;God alone executes this phase of judgment; no intercession, no additional mediation is allowed (<a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>).<p>&#8226;Solemnity&#8212;the pause underscores how serious the upcoming bowl judgments are (<a href="/revelation/15-1.htm">Revelation 15:1</a>).<p>&#8226;Finality&#8212;just as the floodwaters closed Noah&#8217;s ark (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>), the temple&#8217;s closure signals an irrevocable stage of God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed</b><p>The duration is clear: entrance remains barred &#8220;until&#8221; the mission is finished. <a href="/bsb/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a> describes these bowl judgments, culminating in &#8220;It is done!&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>). Key implications:<p>&#8226;The plagues are limited in number&#8212;seven, God&#8217;s number of completeness (<a href="/revelation/10-7.htm">Revelation 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226;They are progressive yet unstoppable; nothing opens the temple prematurely.<p>&#8226;When completed, the way will reopen, leading to the marriage supper (<a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1&#8211;9</a>) and the unveiling of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>This sequence affirms God&#8217;s orderly, purposeful timeline (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/15-8.htm">Revelation 15:8</a> pictures heaven&#8217;s temple saturated with the visible presence of God, stressing His unmatched glory and power. The smoke both shields and signals Him, making entry impossible until His righteous wrath, poured out through the seven bowls, is finished. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s judgment proceeds from His own holy character, follows a precise timetable, and cannot be interrupted. Once completed, the way will reopen for final redemption and eternal fellowship with Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And the temple . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the temple</span> (the same word--<span class= "ital">naos</span>--is used as in <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a>) <span class= "ital">was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his might; and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.</span> As in the wilderness (<a href="/context/exodus/40-34.htm" title="Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.">Exodus 40:34-35</a>), and as at the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="/context/1_kings/8-10.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,">1Kings 8:10-11</a>), the tokens of God's presence filled the temple, so it is now, but with a difference: it is smoke, not cloud, which is the symbol of God's presence. But the vision which perhaps, under all circumstances, most nearly corresponds with the present is that of Isaiah (Isaiah 6); there the prophet beheld the vision of God. His train filled the temple, and the house was filled with smoke, and a message of judgment was given to the prophet; that message declared that the sin of the people had reached a climax: they had trifled with convictions, and henceforward the words of God's servants would harden rather than awaken them. "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes," &c. (<a href="/context/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>), till the desolating judgments had fallen. The general drift of the present vision is similar; the days of warning are over: the plagues which now fall will fall on those who have trifled with convictions: the sanctuary which was opened as a refuge is now closed: none can enter till the plagues have descended. The time has come when the judgments of God fail to stir the conscience which has been deadened by sin; the day when the gracious influences towards repentance was felt has passed. The word that has been spoken is about to descend in judgment (<a href="/john/7-48.htm" title="Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?">John 7:48</a>).
