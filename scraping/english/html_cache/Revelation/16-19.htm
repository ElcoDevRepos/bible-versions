The "great city" is frequently identified as Jerusalem, a central location in biblical prophecy. The division into three parts may symbolize a complete and total upheaval, reflecting the judgment and transformation that occurs during the tribulation period. This division could also be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies found in <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, where the Mount of Olives is split, indicating a dramatic change in the landscape and spiritual order.<p><b>and the cities of the nations collapsed</b><br>This indicates a widespread destruction affecting not just one city but multiple cities across the nations. It suggests a global impact, emphasizing the universal scope of God's judgment. The collapse of these cities can be seen as a reversal of human pride and achievement, reminiscent of the Tower of Babel in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, where God intervened to disrupt human plans. This event underscores the theme of divine sovereignty over human affairs and the futility of relying on worldly power and structures.<p><b>And God remembered Babylon the great</b><br>"Babylon the great" is a symbolic representation of a system or city characterized by opposition to God, often associated with idolatry, immorality, and persecution of the faithful. In biblical history, Babylon was a literal city known for its grandeur and rebellion against God, as seen in the Babylonian captivity of the Israelites. The phrase "God remembered" signifies that God is now acting on His promise to judge Babylon, fulfilling prophecies such as those in <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a>, where Babylon's downfall is foretold.<p><b>and gave her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath</b><br>The imagery of a cup filled with wine is a common biblical metaphor for God's judgment. In this context, it represents the full measure of divine wrath being poured out on Babylon. This echoes the language found in <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-17</a>, where nations are made to drink the cup of God's wrath, leading to their downfall. The "fury of His wrath" highlights the intensity and righteousness of God's judgment against sin and rebellion.

The verse underscores three truths: God&#8217;s sovereignty over the physical earth, His universal reach in judgment, and His unfailing memory of sin that refuses repentance. The collapse of human glory prepares creation for the reign of Christ, assuring believers that every rival kingdom will fall and only the kingdom of our Lord will stand forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the great city.</span> The words which follow, as well as <a href="/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-18.htm">Revelation 17:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-10.htm">Revelation 18:10, 16</a>, etc., leave scarcely any doubt that the "great city" here is Babylon. These are the only passages in the Apocalypse where this title is found; for in <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, "great" is not the true reading. <span class="cmt_word">Was divided into three parts.</span> The signification of this clause is somewhat uncertain. The idea is probably that of total destruction, as in <a href="/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, where a similar description is applied to Jerusalem. Possibly there is a reference to the trinity of evil mentioned in ver. 13. <span class="cmt_word">And the cities of the nations fell.</span> <span class="accented">The nations</span> signifies the ungodly, who stand in the same relation to the godly as the Gentiles to God's chosen people (cf. <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>, etc.). This sentence declares the fall of every lesser form of evil, together with the greater typical form symbolized by" the great city." <span class="cmt_word">And great Babylon came in remembrance before God;</span> <span class="accented">and Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God</span> (Revised Ver-tion). Cf. the title of "great city" (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). Cf. also the similar expression in <a href="/acts/10-31.htm">Acts 10:31</a>. This clause, together with the following one, taken in conjunction with the preceding and succeeding verses, must be referred to the great judgment day. <span class="cmt_word">To give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</span> This is the beginning of the fulfilment of the doom predicted by the angel in <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>. The judgment is more elaborately described in <a href="/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
