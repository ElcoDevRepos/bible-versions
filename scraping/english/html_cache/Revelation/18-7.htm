The imagery of glorification and luxury is reminiscent of ancient Babylon's wealth and grandeur, as well as other historical empires known for their excesses. This self-glorification is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8-9</a>, where Babylon's arrogance leads to its downfall. The Bible consistently warns against pride and self-reliance, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which states that pride precedes destruction.<p><b>give her the same measure of torment and grief</b><br>The principle of divine retribution is evident here, where the punishment matches the sin. This reflects the biblical concept of justice, where actions have corresponding consequences, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "A man reaps what he sows." The torment and grief are proportional to the luxury and self-glorification, emphasizing God's righteous judgment. This mirrors the Old Testament law of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye," found in <a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>, underscoring the fairness of divine justice.<p><b>In her heart she says, &#8216;I sit as queen; I am not a widow and will never see grief.&#8217;</b><br>This statement reveals Babylon's false sense of security and invincibility. The imagery of sitting as a queen suggests authority and power, while the denial of widowhood and grief indicates a belief in perpetual stability and prosperity. This echoes the attitude of ancient Babylon, as described in <a href="/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7-8</a>, where the city boasts of its eternal reign. The prophetic literature often uses the metaphor of a widow to describe desolation and loss, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>. The arrogance and self-deception of Babylon are ultimately its downfall, as God's judgment is inevitable, fulfilling prophecies of destruction and humbling of the proud.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>Symbolic of a great city or system representing human pride, luxury, and opposition to God.
