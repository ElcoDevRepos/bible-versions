Angels often serve as messengers in biblical narratives, conveying God's revelations to humans. In Revelation, angels play a significant role in delivering visions and messages to John, emphasizing the divine origin and authority of the message.<p><b>These words are faithful and true</b><br>The assurance that the words are "faithful and true" underscores the reliability and trustworthiness of the prophecy. This echoes similar affirmations found in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9 and 21</a>:5, reinforcing the certainty of God's promises. The phrase assures believers that the visions and prophecies will be fulfilled as stated.<p><b>The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty and His role as the source of prophetic inspiration. The "spirits of the prophets" refers to the divine influence that guided the prophets throughout biblical history. This connection to the prophetic tradition underscores the continuity and consistency of God's revelation from the Old Testament to the New Testament.<p><b>has sent His angel</b><br>The sending of the angel signifies divine initiative and purpose. In biblical tradition, angels are often dispatched by God to deliver messages, provide guidance, or execute His will. This emphasizes the importance and urgency of the message being conveyed to John.<p><b>to show His servants</b><br>The term "servants" refers to believers who are committed to following God's will. This phrase indicates that the revelation is intended for the edification and encouragement of the Christian community. It aligns with the broader biblical theme of God revealing His plans to those who serve Him faithfully.<p><b>what must soon take place</b><br>This phrase points to the imminence of the events described in Revelation. The use of "soon" suggests a sense of urgency and anticipation, encouraging believers to remain vigilant and faithful. This aligns with the eschatological focus of the book, which emphasizes the nearness of Christ's return and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to communicate His revelations to John.

Their presence highlights the gravity of the message and the certainty that it comes from God, not human imagination.<p>- <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> shows a similar moment: &#8220;Then the angel said to me, &#8216;Write&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; Both scenes remind us that the visions are dictated, not devised.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These words are faithful and true</b><p>- The angel echoes <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>, where the enthroned Lord declares, &#8220;Write this down, for these words are faithful and true.&#8221; God never contradicts Himself; what He promises, He performs (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>- &#8220;Faithful&#8221; assures reliability&#8212;the words will come to pass. &#8220;True&#8221; guarantees accuracy&#8212;nothing here is embellished.<p>- Revelation opens with the same assurance: the testimony of Jesus Christ is &#8220;what God revealed to Him&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). The book ends the way it began, bracketing everything in divine trustworthiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets</b><p>- The title underscores that the same Lord who inspired Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the rest now speaks through John (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>- &#8220;Spirits of the prophets&#8221; points to God&#8217;s sovereign mastery over the inner life of every true prophet. He directs their spirits so that their words become His words.<p>- This means Revelation carries equal authority with earlier prophetic books (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>). The canon forms a seamless story authored by one God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has sent His angel</b><p>- <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> begins, &#8220;He sent it and communicated it by His angel to His servant John.&#8221; The closing verse circles back, stressing that nothing has changed in the chain of custody.<p>- Angels are servants sent &#8220;to minister to those who will inherit salvation&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Their involvement showcases both God&#8217;s transcendence&#8212;He employs heavenly envoys&#8212;and His nearness&#8212;He lovingly delivers the message to us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to show His servants</b><p>- God reveals His plans to those who belong to Him (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). In <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1-3</a> the same phrase appears, emphasizing that prophetic truth is a gift for everyday believers, not a secret society.<p>- Jesus told His disciples, &#8220;I have called you friends, for everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>). Revelation continues that friendship, pulling back the curtain for Christ&#8217;s servants.<p>- <a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> promises visions and dreams &#8220;in the last days.&#8221; Revelation is the climactic fulfillment of that outpouring, intended for every servant, young or old.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what must soon take place</b><p>- The identical wording in <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a> creates bookends around the prophecy. God wants us to feel the urgency.<p>- &#8220;Soon&#8221; highlights imminence, not indifference to calendar years. God stands outside time (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8-9</a>), yet He calls each generation to live alertly (<a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11-12</a>).<p>- Jesus reiterates the theme in this same chapter: &#8220;Behold, I am coming soon&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7, 12</a>). The nearness of His return motivates purity (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2-3</a>) and perseverance (<a href="/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a> anchors the entire book in God&#8217;s own character&#8212;faithful, true, authoritative, and purposeful.

Nor is there reason to doubt this; for "<span class= "ital">the Lord, the God of the spirits of the Prophets</span>--the God whose spirit moved the holy men of old to speak (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>)--<span class= "ital">sent His angel to show to His servants things which must come to pass shortly."</span> (Comp. Note on <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm" title="The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show to his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel to his servant John:">Revelation 1:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> Probably the angel who has exhibited the vision of the holy city (<a href="/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>); perhaps the angel of <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>. The concluding portion of the book is now entered upon; it contains a brief summary of (or rather reference to) the chief events which have been narrated, and enforces the lesson which is intended to be taught, viz. that Christians should persevere in well doing amid all persecutions, for their reward is certain, and that the punishment due to the wicked will surely overtake them at last. The angel asserts the veracity of what is contained in the book (ver. 6; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); the time in which to prepare is brief (vers. 6, 7, 12; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3, 7</a>); the prophecy is to be communicated to others (ver. 10; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1-3</a>); God is eternal (ver. 13; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>); the just are rewarded (vers. 14, 17; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>); the wicked are punished (ver. 15; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>); the prophecy is to be faithfully handed on (vers. 18, 19; cf. <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These sayings are faithful and true.</span> That is, all that has been conveyed to the seer (cf. the following verses).
