The "beast" is often interpreted as a representation of a powerful, anti-Christian entity or system, possibly a political or religious leader, as described earlier in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. This worship signifies a deep-seated allegiance and submission, contrasting with the worship due to God alone. The phrase suggests a time of great deception and apostasy, aligning with prophecies in <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a> about a "man of lawlessness" who exalts himself.<p><b>all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world</b><br>This part emphasizes the concept of divine election and predestination, suggesting that God, in His omniscience, has a predetermined plan for salvation. The "foundation of the world" indicates that God's plan and knowledge transcend time, aligning with <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, which speaks of believers being chosen before the world's creation. This phrase reassures believers of their secure place in God's eternal plan, contrasting with those who follow the beast.<p><b>in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb</b><br>The "Book of Life" is a metaphorical record of those who have eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ, the Lamb. The Lamb imagery connects to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where a lamb was offered for atonement, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). This book is mentioned in other parts of Revelation (e.g., 20:12, 21:27), symbolizing the assurance of salvation and eternal life for believers.<p><b>who was slain</b><br>This phrase refers to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, whose sacrificial death provides redemption for humanity. The term "slain" highlights the violent nature of His death, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>. It underscores the centrality of the cross in Christian theology, where Jesus' death and resurrection are pivotal for salvation, as echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>.

<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; The passage warns believers today to expect growing pressure toward compromise, underscoring Jesus&#8217; call to remain faithful even when the majority bows to falsehood (<a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All whose names have not been written</b><p>&#8226; The verse immediately narrows the &#8220;all.&#8221; There is a distinct exception: those whose names appear in a divine registry.<p>&#8226; The contrast highlights that what ultimately separates people is not culture, education, or personality but whether their names are recorded by God (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This reassurance is meant to settle the hearts of believers&#8212;God knows His own and will keep them (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the foundation of the world</b><p>&#8226;

God&#8217;s redemptive plan, set &#8220;from the foundation of the world,&#8221; guarantees that those secured by Christ&#8217;s sacrifice will not be swept away by end-time deception.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And all that dwell . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And all they that dwell on the earth shall worship him </span>(<span class= "ital">every one</span>)<span class= "ital"> whose name has not been written in the book of life of the Lamb that has been slain from the foundation of the world.</span> This is the climax of his triumph: he, or it, is worshipped; but the saints, though conquered, conquer; they do not worship after the fashion of the deluded or self-seeking. A stronger tie binds them to a better allegiance; their names are in the Lamb's Book of Life. There is some doubt about the connection of the words "from the foundation of the world." Some connect them with the word "written": this would express that the names were written "from the foundation of the world" in the book. Others connect them with the word "slain": this expresses that the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world. For the former view, the similar passage in <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a> is cited; but, on the other hand, the phrase "from the foundation of the world" is connected in other parts of the Bible with certain aspects of the work of Christ (<a href="/context/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19-20</a>, and <a href="/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>), and it seems more natural to take the words in their simple order. Whatever view we take, the verse proclaims that the security of God's saints is based on the eternal love of God. "An eternal deliverer is the only refuge from this great world-tyranny; "the strength of the tempted is in Him who is the same in love and righteousness through all the ages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb</span>; [<span class="accented">every</span> one] <span class="accented">whose name hath not been written</span>, as in the Revised Version.

In all the places where it occurs it seems to refer primarily to Christians (cf. <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-19.htm">Revelation 22:19</a>). At baptism the Christian's name is written in the "book of life," from which there is always a possibility of it being blotted out (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). Those who are not Christians have not their name in the "book of life," but <span class="accented">worship</span> the beast, that is, pay allegiance to him. It is "the book of life of the Lamb," because it is through "the Lamb" that there exists a "book of life" for men. <span class="cmt_word">Slain from the foundation of the world;</span> or, <span class="accented">that hath been slain.</span> It is natural to connect the words, "from the foundation of the world," with "slain," and not with "written." The latter course has been followed by Bengel, Dusterdieck, De Wette, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and others, and in the margin of the Revised Version, and is in accordance with <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>, "Whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world" (see also <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). "The Lamb hath been slain from the foundation of the world," because from "the foundation of the world" (cf. <a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>) his death has been efficacious for the salvation of men; and because his death "was foreordained before the foundation of the world," although manifest only in the last times (<a href="/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). What was foreknown to and ordained by God is spoken of as having taken place. This latter sense must be the meaning if we adopt the alternative reading. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
