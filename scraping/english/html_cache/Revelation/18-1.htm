The "another angel" suggests a new messenger distinct from those previously mentioned, emphasizing the ongoing revelation. Angels in biblical literature often serve as divine messengers or agents of God's will. The descent from heaven signifies a divine origin and authority, reinforcing the heavenly source of the message. This imagery is consistent with other biblical accounts where angels are depicted as descending to deliver important messages or enact God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5-6</a>).<p><b>with great authority</b><br>The angel's "great authority" underscores the significance and power of the message being delivered. In biblical terms, authority often denotes the right to command or enforce obedience, reflecting divine backing. This authority is reminiscent of the authority given to Jesus (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>) and the apostles (<a href="/luke/9.htm">Luke 9:1</a>). It suggests that the angel's message carries the weight of divine decree, possibly indicating impending judgment or significant revelation.<p><b>and the earth was illuminated by his glory</b><br>The illumination of the earth by the angel's glory highlights the divine presence and the transformative power of God's glory. In biblical tradition, glory often signifies God's manifest presence, as seen in the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>) and the transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>). The illumination suggests a revelation of truth or exposure of hidden things, aligning with themes of light overcoming darkness (<a href="/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>). This imagery may also foreshadow the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom, where His glory fills the earth (<a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_angel.htm">Another Angel</a></b><br>This angel is distinct from those previously mentioned in Revelation.

The phrase tells us John is recording the next scene in a carefully ordered series. The judgment of Babylon in chapter 17 has just been revealed; now we are shown its announcement and execution. Just as Daniel&#8217;s visions unfold step-by-step (<a href="/bsb/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7&#8211;8</a>), John&#8217;s record follows a literal progression of events God intends to bring to pass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I saw</b><p>John is not reporting hearsay; he is an eyewitness chosen to &#8220;testify to everything he saw&#8221; (1:2). His repeated &#8220;I saw&#8221; echoes Old Testament prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>) and affirms that the revelation comes from God, not imagination. Our faith rests on actual revelation, not speculation (22:8).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another angel</b><p>This angel is distinct from the one who showed John the vision of the woman and the beast (17:1) and from the three angels of chapter 14. Scripture records many mighty angels executing God&#8217;s judgments (14:6&#8211;9; 16:1), and the word &#8220;another&#8221; simply marks him as one more of that heavenly host. He is not Christ in angelic form&#8212;Jesus is already portrayed as the Lamb and King (17:14). Like Gabriel in <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>, this messenger speaks for God and carries divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>descending from heaven</b><p>The angel&#8217;s origin underscores that the judgment comes straight from God&#8217;s throne (10:1; <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>). Heaven is the command center; earth is the stage where the decree will unfold. The downward movement mirrors earlier judgments&#8212;fire in 8:5, hail in 16:21&#8212;reinforcing that Babylon&#8217;s fall is not manmade but heaven-sent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with great authority</b><p>All true authority is delegated by God (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). The angel is empowered to proclaim Babylon&#8217;s doom and to carry out portions of it. In 14:8 another angel announced, &#8220;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,&#8221; but this one does so with even greater weight, signaling the nearness of the final blow. Just as Michael wielded authority over the dragon (12:7-9), this angel wields it over the corrupt world system symbolized by Babylon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the earth was illuminated</b><p>The brilliance recalls <a href="/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>, where the prophet sees &#8220;the earth shining with His glory,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, which promises coming light amid darkness. Here the light briefly pierces earth&#8217;s gloom before the seventh bowl plunges Babylon into destruction (16:19). It highlights the contrast between heaven&#8217;s purity and Babylon&#8217;s moral night. The illumination also ensures that the angel&#8217;s message is visible and unmistakable to all nations (14:6).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by his glory</b><p>The radiance is not the angel&#8217;s own; it is a reflection of God&#8217;s glory, similar to Moses&#8217; face shining after meeting the LORD (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a>) and the shepherds&#8217; field lit by God&#8217;s splendor (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>). Just as believers are called to &#8220;reflect the Lord&#8217;s glory&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>), this angel mirrors divine majesty, underscoring the seriousness of the coming judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a> introduces a new, heaven-sent messenger who steps onto the prophetic stage immediately after the vision of chapter 17. John personally witnesses this angel descend from heaven, vested with God-given authority to declare Babylon&#8217;s imminent downfall. His arrival floods the earth with borrowed glory, momentarily exposing the darkness of the world system before God&#8217;s final judgment falls. The verse assures us that heaven governs history, that God&#8217;s announcements are sure, and that His glory will ultimately outshine every earthly power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And after these things . . .</span>--Or, better, <span class= "ital">After these things</span> (omit "and") <span class= "ital">I saw another angel coming down, having great power</span> (or, <span class= "ital">authority</span>--entrusted to him for the work against Babylon); <span class= "ital">and the earth was illumined by</span> (literally, <span class= "ital">out of</span>)<span class= "ital"> his glory.</span> The light which shines from the heavenly messenger shines like day upon the tawdry splendour of Babylon, and shows that what was admired was but worthless and corrupt.
