This elder addressing John signifies a moment of revelation and teaching, emphasizing the importance of understanding the vision. Elders in biblical times were respected leaders, often associated with wisdom and authority, which aligns with their role in the heavenly throne room.<p><b>&#8220;These in white robes,&#8221;</b><br>White robes are symbolic of purity, righteousness, and victory. In the context of Revelation, they often represent those who have been redeemed and cleansed by the blood of the Lamb. White garments are a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing holiness and divine approval (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>). The imagery of white robes also connects to the priestly garments in the Old Testament, indicating a status of sanctification and service to God.<p><b>he asked, &#8220;who are they, and where have they come from?&#8221;</b><br>This question serves to draw attention to the identity and origin of the multitude in white robes. It invites reflection on the nature of salvation and the journey of the faithful. The inquiry highlights the mystery of God's redemptive plan and the diverse backgrounds of those who are saved. The question also echoes the prophetic tradition of seeking understanding of divine visions, as seen in <a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>, where Daniel seeks interpretation of his vision. The emphasis on "where have they come from" suggests a focus on the trials and tribulations they have endured, pointing to the theme of perseverance and faithfulness in the face of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/one_of_the_elders.htm">One of the Elders</a></b><br>In the heavenly vision, John sees twenty-four elders seated around the throne of God.
