In the context of Revelation, "overcomes" refers to those who remain faithful to Christ despite trials and temptations. This echoes the messages to the seven churches in <a href="/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2-3</a>, where overcoming is a recurring theme. Biblically, overcoming is linked to faith in Jesus (1 <a href="/john/5-4.htm">John 5:4-5</a>) and is a call to remain steadfast in the face of persecution, much like the early Christians who faced Roman oppression.<p><b>and continues in My work until the end,</b><br>This part highlights the importance of perseverance in doing Christ's work. It suggests a continuous, active engagement in living out the teachings of Jesus. The "end" can be interpreted as the end of one's life or the end of the age, pointing to the eschatological focus of Revelation. This aligns with the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where faithful service is rewarded. It underscores the call to discipleship and the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<p><b>I will give authority over the nations.</b><br>This promise of authority reflects the eschatological hope of believers reigning with Christ. It connects to the messianic prophecy in <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>, where the Messiah is given the nations as an inheritance. In Revelation, this authority is part of the millennial reign (<a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4-6</a>), where believers share in Christ's rule. It also ties to the promise made to the apostles in <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, where they are told they will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. This authority signifies the ultimate victory and vindication of the faithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_one_who_overcomes.htm">The One Who Overcomes</a></b><br>This refers to believers who remain faithful to Christ despite trials and temptations.

(Comp. the Messianic prophecy of Psalms 2) Those who refused to stoop to the customs around them, and to gain influence by crushing or ignoring their convictions--those who, like their Master, refused to win power by doing homage to wrong (<a href="/context/matthew/4-8.htm" title="Again, the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;">Matthew 4:8-10</a>), would share the nobler sway which He now established. Wherever the Church has illegitimately grasped at power, she has lost it. "The wretched power which she had wrenched and stolen from the nations has been turned against her; she has been obliged to crouch to them, and beg their help, and they have justly spurned her. She has chosen to exalt herself like Lucifer, and she has fallen like Lucifer. If she had trusted her Lord, He would have given her the morning star. She would have derived from Him what she claimed independently of Him.
