This mirrors the world's reaction to the crucifixion of Jesus, where His enemies believed they had won. It highlights the spiritual blindness and moral corruption of those who reject God's truth.<p><b>and send one another gifts</b><br>This act of sending gifts is reminiscent of ancient customs where gifts were exchanged to celebrate significant events.

Like the prophets of old, these two witnesses call people to turn from their sins, which is often met with hostility.
