The ability to control rain signifies divine authority and judgment. In the context of Revelation, the witnesses' power to shut the sky symbolizes God's control over nature and His ability to use it as a tool for judgment. The drought during their prophecy highlights the severity and urgency of their message, emphasizing repentance and the consequences of ignoring divine warnings.<p><b>and power to turn the waters into blood</b><br>This imagery recalls the first plague in Egypt, where Moses turned the Nile into blood (<a href="/exodus/7-14.htm">Exodus 7:14-24</a>). This act was a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods and a demonstration of God's supremacy. In Revelation, the transformation of water into blood by the witnesses serves as a sign of judgment against those who oppose God's will. It underscores the seriousness of rebellion against God and the inevitability of divine retribution. The act also symbolizes the corruption and death that result from sin.<p><b>and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish</b><br>The reference to plagues connects to the ten plagues of Egypt, which were divine judgments against Pharaoh and his people (Exodus 7-12). These plagues were meant to demonstrate God's power and compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. In Revelation, the ability of the witnesses to unleash plagues signifies their role as agents of divine judgment. It highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His justice. The phrase "as often as they wish" indicates the witnesses' authority and the persistent opportunity for repentance, emphasizing God's patience and desire for people to turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_witnesses.htm">The Two Witnesses</a></b><br>These are prophetic figures in <a href="/bsb/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a>, endowed with divine authority to perform miraculous signs.

The whole verse is descriptive of the powers entrusted to Moses and Elijah, and is intended to convey the idea that the power which supported them would likewise support the two witnesses. It is doubtful whether the meaning should be pressed further than this. If we do so, it may, perhaps, be said that (in the words of Wordsworth) "if any one despises God's witnesses, they have the power, like Elias, to shut heaven, and exclude all who reject them. The dews of Divine grace are withheld from all who scorn them." It is thus a fulfilment of our Lord's words, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath" (<a href="/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>). And again, besides the punishments which are finally to fall on the ungodly, it is the case that the rejection of God's will is followed on this earth by troubles which would be avoided were men to listen to the witness borne of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">These [witnesses]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(houtoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">have</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#967;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(echousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2192.htm">Strong's 2192: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have, hold, possess.
