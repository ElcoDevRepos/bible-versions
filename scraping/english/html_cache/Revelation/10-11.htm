The "they" refers to the voices or beings in the heavenly vision, possibly the angel mentioned earlier in the chapter. This reflects the divine authority and the heavenly origin of the message John is receiving, emphasizing the importance and urgency of the prophecy.<p><b>&#8220;You must prophesy again</b><br>John is being commanded to continue his prophetic mission. The word "again" suggests a continuation or renewal of his prophetic role, indicating that his work is not yet complete. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of perseverance in one's divine calling, as seen in the lives of other prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who were also called to persist in their missions despite challenges.<p><b>about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of John's prophecy. It is not limited to a single group but extends to all humanity, reflecting the global nature of God's plan. The mention of "peoples, nations, tongues, and kings" underscores the diversity and inclusivity of the message, reminiscent of the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. This also connects to the vision in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where a great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language stands before the throne, illustrating the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The recipient of the vision and the one instructed to prophesy.

The same chain of authority reassures us that what follows is trustworthy (cf. <a href="/revelation/22-6.htm">Revelation 22:6</a>).<p>- Throughout Scripture, God often repeats a calling after a dramatic encounter&#8212;think of Elijah&#8217;s renewed mission in <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15-18</a> or Ezekiel&#8217;s second commissioning in <a href="/ezekiel/3-4.htm">Ezekiel 3:4-11</a>.

At Pentecost, the crowd heard &#8220;each one... in his own language&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-6.htm">Acts 2:6-11</a>).<p>- John&#8217;s vision underscores that prophecy must penetrate linguistic divisions so every tongue can confess that Jesus Christ is Lord (<a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>).<p>- Revelation itself became Scripture translated into thousands of languages, fulfilling this directive.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and kings</b><p>&#8226; Prophecy will confront rulers just as Moses stood before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/5-1.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>), Nathan before David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), and Paul before Agrippa (<a href="/acts/26-27.htm">Acts 26:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Later in the book, kings assemble against the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12-14</a>), yet &#8220;the Lamb will triumph&#8221; because He is &#8220;King of kings.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The message to kings is twofold: a warning of judgment (<a href="/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10-12</a>) and an invitation to join the nations bringing their glory into the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/10-11.htm">Revelation 10:11</a> is God&#8217;s resounding recommission of John. Having digested the bittersweet scroll, he must proclaim God&#8217;s unaltered Word once more, addressing every layer of humanity&#8212;from common peoples in every language to the highest rulers of the earth. The verse assures believers that God&#8217;s gospel and judgments are universal, unavoidable, and ultimately victorious, urging us to faithful witness until Christ&#8217;s return.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And he . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And they</span> (not "he," as in the English version, but <span class= "ital">they say:</span> an equivalent for "It was said,") <span class= "ital">say to me, Thou must again prophesy concerning</span> (or, <span class= "ital">with regard to) peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings many.</span> He is told that the bitterness will arise in connection with his prophecies with regard to peoples and kings. This carries us on to the vision in the next chapter, where the two witnesses stand so solitary, and prophesy so mightily, yet so vainly, among men. He will have to tell the story of churches and peoples, priests and princes, unmindful of their high calling and their allegiance to their true king, and of their hatred of God's mightiest and purest witnesses. The end, indeed, will come. The Church will be victorious. The kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of Christ: but it will be through persecutions, apostasies, judgments. This is the sad vision he must describe. The interposed visions will answer the question, "What has the Church been doing?" but it will show how she has done that work, distressed by heresies, crippled by worldliness, trodden down by enemies, and, worse than enemies, foes veiled as friends. But this very vision will lead to the unfolding of the more truly spiritual aspects of the Church's work, and of that conflict in which she contends with the multiform spirit and power of evil. Thus will he prophesy of peoples and kings many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f72;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "they say," is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, and thirty cursives, and is adopted in the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he saith," is found in P and seventeen cursives. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> leaves the speakers quite indefinite, amounting, in fact, to no more than" it was said" (Alford); cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="/revelation/12-6.htm">Revelation 12:6</a>; also <a href="/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>. 13. Thou must prophesy again. <span class="accented">Thou retest</span>, because it is laid upon thee by God's command. It is to be done <span class="accented">again</span>, because the seer has already to some extent set forth God's will in the earlier part of the book; and he is now required to proceed with the delivery of his message. "Prophesy" (as in <a href="/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>) has rather its literal than its derived meaning. It is the telling forth of God's purposes, and may refer to past as well as present or future events. The sentence refers to the announcements made in the following part of the Apocalypse (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). Bede and others take it to mean the Gospel of St. John, which was, perhaps, afterwards composed (see Introduction). Victorinus thinks it points to the period of St. John's return from Patmos to Ephesus, where the Apocalypse may have been published. <span class="cmt_word">Before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings;</span> <span class="accented">concerning many peoples</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, with dative). These are the objects of the prophecy, not the audience. This serves to explain the reference in the preceding sentence. The message is not delivered <span class="accented">to</span>, but <span class="accented">about</span> peoples, etc. The fourfold enumeration seems to point to the breadth of the signification - it embraces the whole of mankind (cf. <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>). This is the end of what is called by many writers the first episode; the second follows. The incident is often alluded to as the "new commission" of St. John; but it seems less a new commission than a solemn re-enactment of the command delivered in <a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they told</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#943;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(legousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">me,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#959;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(moi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1473.htm">Strong's 1473: </a> </span><span class="str2">I, the first-person pronoun.
