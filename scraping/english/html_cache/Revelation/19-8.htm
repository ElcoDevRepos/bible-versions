The "fine linen" represents purity and righteousness, often associated with priestly garments in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-43</a>). The brightness and purity of the linen emphasize the holiness and sanctity expected of the Church. In ancient times, fine linen was a luxury, signifying wealth and status, which here symbolizes the spiritual richness and honor bestowed upon the Church by Christ. The imagery of clothing is also used in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, where garments of salvation and a robe of righteousness are mentioned, highlighting the transformation and sanctification of believers.<p><b>For the fine linen she wears is the righteous acts of the saints.</b><br>This part of the verse clarifies that the fine linen represents the righteous deeds of believers. It underscores the importance of living a life that reflects one's faith, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The "righteous acts" are not the means of salvation but the evidence of a transformed life in Christ. This aligns with <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, which speaks of believers being created for good works. The saints' righteous acts are a response to God's grace, illustrating the cooperative relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility in the life of a believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bride.htm">The Bride</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Church, the collective body of believers who are united with Christ.

The song closes with the announcement that the Lamb's wife has made herself ready. Then follows the explanation of this readiness: she is adorned in fine linen. Her apparel is in contrast to the harlot: it is not purple and scarlet (<a href="/revelation/17-4.htm" title="And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-16.htm" title="And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!">Revelation 18:16</a>), but pure white. The symbol is explained: "the fine linen is the righteousness (or, <span class= "ital">righteousnesses</span>) of the saints." The raiment is that which strikes the eye: it has its character, and it indicates the character of the wearer. The harlot attracts by ostentatious colours, the tokens of qualities more conspicuous than abiding, more dazzling than helpful; the Lamb's wife is robed in pure and stainless white, the token of those high, moral, spiritual qualities by which she has been known. The source of these righteousnesses is divine: it is given to her to be so arrayed. It is no fictitious righteousness: it is real, it is hers, though it would never have been hers but for Him without whom she can do nothing (comp. <a href="/context/john/15-4.htm" title="Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.">John 15:4-5</a>, and <a href="/context/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Philippians 3:8-10</a>): and it is through the wearing of this white flower of a blameless life that she has borne witness for her Lord, and against the spirit of harlotry and sin (<a href="/context/matthew/7-16.htm" title="You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?">Matthew 7:16-18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white;</span> <span class="accented">and it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright</span> [<span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="accented">pure.</span> The double nature of the process is here set forth. "It was given her," the power comes from God (cf. <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>, etc.), and yet "she arrays herself;" the action is still voluntary. (On "white linen," see on Revelation 4:4; 7:9; 15:6.) The following words are a sufficient commentary. This verse appears to contain the words of the writer, the heavenly song having ceased at the end of ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints;</span> <span class="accented">the righteous acts of the saints.</span> That is, their former righteousness, exhibited in fidelity to God and hostility to the world, obtained and retained by the grace of God, now forms their chief glory.
