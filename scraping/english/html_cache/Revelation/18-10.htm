The fear is not just physical but also spiritual, as the torment represents divine retribution. This echoes the Old Testament prophecies against cities like Nineveh and Tyre, where fear was a response to God's judgment (<a href="/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16-18</a>).<p><b>they will stand at a distance</b><br>The distance signifies both literal and metaphorical separation. Those witnessing Babylon's fall are removed from the immediate destruction, possibly indicating their desire to avoid sharing in her fate. This mirrors the reaction of Lot's wife in <a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>, who looked back at Sodom's destruction, and the warning to flee from sin and judgment.<p><b>and cry out</b><br>The act of crying out is a common biblical expression of lament and despair. It reflects the deep emotional response to witnessing the downfall of a once-great power. This is reminiscent of the lamentations over fallen cities in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1:1-2</a>.<p><b>&#8220;Woe, woe to the great city,</b><br>The repetition of "woe" emphasizes the severity and certainty of the judgment. The term "great city" underscores Babylon's prominence and influence, much like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which were also judged for their wickedness (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>).<p><b>the mighty city of Babylon!</b><br>Babylon is symbolic of human pride and opposition to God, drawing from its historical role as a center of idolatry and rebellion (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The reference to its might highlights the contrast between its earthly power and its ultimate downfall, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19-22</a>.<p><b>For in a single hour your judgment has come.&#8221;</b><br>The suddenness of the judgment underscores the swiftness and decisiveness of God's action. This echoes the theme of unexpected judgment found in the parables of Jesus, such as the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). The phrase "single hour" indicates the completeness and finality of the event, reminiscent of the sudden fall of other biblical cities like Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, corrupt system or city that opposes God.
