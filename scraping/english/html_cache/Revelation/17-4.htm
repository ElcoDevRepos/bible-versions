Purple dye was expensive and difficult to produce, making it a symbol of high status and power. Scarlet, similarly, was a color worn by the elite. In the context of Revelation, these colors may symbolize the seductive allure and deceptive power of the woman, representing a corrupt system or entity that appears attractive and authoritative but is ultimately sinful and opposed to God.<p><b>and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls</b><br>The adornment with gold, precious stones, and pearls signifies opulence and material wealth. In biblical symbolism, such wealth can indicate both blessing and corruption, depending on the context. Here, it suggests the woman's seductive and deceptive nature, using wealth and beauty to entice and lead astray. This imagery echoes the description of Babylon in the Old Testament, a city known for its wealth and idolatry, and serves as a warning against the dangers of materialism and idolatry.<p><b>She held in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality</b><br>The golden cup represents something that appears valuable and desirable but is filled with abominations and impurities. In biblical terms, abominations often refer to idolatry and practices detestable to God. The impurities of her sexual immorality symbolize spiritual unfaithfulness and corruption. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>, where Babylon is described as a golden cup in the Lord's hand, making the nations drunk with her wine.
