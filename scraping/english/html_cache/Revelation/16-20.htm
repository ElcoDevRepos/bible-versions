In biblical symbolism, islands often represent distant lands or isolated places. The imagery of islands fleeing could symbolize the removal or destruction of these distant places, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment. This aligns with prophetic language found in <a href="/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-20</a>, where the earth is described as being violently shaken. The idea of islands fleeing also echoes the theme of divine intervention and upheaval seen in other apocalyptic literature, such as the Book of Daniel and the visions of Ezekiel.<p><b>and no mountain could be found</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize stability, permanence, and the presence of God, as seen in Mount Sinai and Mount Zion. The disappearance of mountains signifies the removal of all that is considered stable and enduring in the world. This imagery is consistent with other apocalyptic passages, such as <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a> and <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>, where mountains melt or quake at the presence of the Lord. Theologically, this can be seen as a demonstration of God's power to dismantle the established order in preparation for the new creation, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>. The absence of mountains underscores the theme of divine judgment and the transient nature of earthly things in contrast to the eternal kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/islands.htm">Islands</a></b><br>In the biblical context, islands often symbolize distant lands or places of refuge.
