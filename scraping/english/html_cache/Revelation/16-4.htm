The third angel is part of a sequence, following the first and second angels, each delivering a specific judgment. The imagery of pouring out a bowl suggests a complete and decisive action, symbolizing the fullness of God's wrath being dispensed. This act is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where God's judgment was also poured out in a series of devastating events (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>into the rivers and springs of water</b><br>The focus on rivers and springs highlights the targeting of essential sources of fresh water, which are vital for life and sustenance. In the ancient world, rivers and springs were crucial for agriculture, drinking water, and daily living. The judgment here disrupts the natural order and provision, emphasizing the severity of God's wrath. This mirrors the first plague in Egypt, where the Nile River was turned to blood, affecting all water sources (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>).<p><b>and they turned to blood</b><br>The transformation of water into blood is a direct parallel to the first Egyptian plague, reinforcing the theme of divine judgment against those who oppose God. Blood symbolizes death and judgment, indicating the seriousness of the consequences for sin and rebellion. This imagery also connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where blood was required for atonement, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>). The turning of water to blood serves as a stark reminder of the cost of sin and the necessity of repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/third_angel.htm">Third Angel</a></b><br>This angel is one of the seven angels tasked with pouring out the bowls of God's wrath upon the earth.

By the time the &#8220;third angel&#8221; steps forward, the world has already suffered judgments on the earth and the sea (<a href="/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The numbering shows divine order rather than random catastrophe. Just as the plagues in Egypt unfolded in a deliberate sequence (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>), these end-time judgments proceed under God&#8217;s sovereign timetable.<p>&#8226; Previous cycles&#8212;seals (<a href="/bsb/revelation/6.htm">Revelation 6</a>) and trumpets (<a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8&#8211;9</a>)&#8212;grew increasingly intense; the bowls represent the final, undiluted wrath (<a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>). That progression assures believers that God&#8217;s justice never stalls, even when human impatience wonders why judgment tarries (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>poured out his bowl</b><p>&#8226; To &#8220;pour&#8221; conveys total release; nothing is held back. <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a> pictures a similar image: &#8220;For in the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices, and He pours it out.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Unlike earlier trumpet judgments that affected only a third of their target (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7&#8211;12</a>), a bowl judgment is comprehensive. The language invites a literal reading: an actual angel spills an actual bowl of God&#8217;s wrath upon a physical planet.<p>&#8226; The action stems from heavenly authority, not angelic whim. The angel obeys the command issued in <a href="/revelation/16-1.htm">Revelation 16:1</a>, reminding us that God remains personally involved in executing justice (<a href="/revelation/19-2.htm">Revelation 19:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the rivers and springs of water</b><p>&#8226; The target now shifts from salty seas (second bowl, <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a>) to freshwater sources&#8212;&#8220;the rivers and springs.&#8221; Every stream, well, aquifer, and fountain comes under judgment.<p>&#8226; Humanity depends daily on these waters (<a href="/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). By striking them, God touches basic survival and exposes idolatrous trust in earthly resources.<p>&#8226; The third trumpet had already spoiled many rivers with wormwood (<a href="/revelation/8-10.htm">Revelation 8:10&#8211;11</a>). That earlier warning was partial; this bowl is total. Refusal to repent under lighter discipline leads to heavier judgment (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they turned to blood</b><p>&#8226; The description echoes the first Egyptian plague: &#8220;All the waters of the Nile were turned to blood&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20</a>). Just as Pharaoh hardened his heart, the end-time world will still refuse repentance (<a href="/revelation/16-9.htm">Revelation 16:9, 11</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording is straightforward: the waters &#8220;turned to blood,&#8221; not to a reddish hue or symbolic impurity. God can, and will, perform literal miracles of judgment, just as He will literally raise the dead and literally create a new heaven and earth (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12&#8211;13</a>; 21:1).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/11-6.htm">Revelation 11:6</a> records the two witnesses having authority &#8220;to turn the waters into blood.&#8221; Their ministry foreshadows this global event, underscoring that every warning God gives will ultimately be fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The third bowl shows God&#8217;s perfectly ordered wrath advancing from land to sea to freshwater. An obedient angel empties a bowl straight into the lifelines of human society, and those waters literally become blood. The scene recalls Egypt&#8217;s plagues, proving that past judgments foreshadow future ones. It demonstrates that God&#8217;s patience has limits, His justice is precise, and His Word is exact. Believers find assurance that the Lord keeps every promise, while unbelievers receive sober testimony that rejecting His grace now leads inexorably to His righteous judgment then.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And the third angel . . .</span>--The third vial resembles the second in its effects. As it is poured out on the rivers and springs of waters, they become blood. It is not only the great sea which becomes blood, but all the merry streams and babbling brooks which carry their tribute of water seawards also turn corrupt. And this plague is acknowledged by heavenly voices as a just retribution (<a href="/context/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5-7</a>). The streams and rivers feed the sea; they are the powers and influences which go to the making up of the great popular sentiment; these are smitten by the same corruption. Men cannot worship worldliness or earthliness without degrading even those who contribute to their instruction, their recreations, and their joys, to the same level. When the public taste grows corrupt, the literature will, for example, become so in a more or less degree; the up-flowing tide will colour the down-coming stream. "The morality of a nation's art," writes a modern critic. "always rises to the level of morality in a nation's manners. Morality takes care of itself, and always revenges any outrage which art may put upon its laws by either lowering the art that so offends, or extinguishing it" (Dallas, <span class= "ital">Gay Science, </span>Vol. II., 16). It is true in even a wider sense. The loftier powers of imagination, the range of poetical elevation, are cramped and killed in a base, world-worshipping age. The streams of life grow putrid, the fresh and bright gifts of God are polluted, when the ocean of public thought is unwholesome.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood</span>.
