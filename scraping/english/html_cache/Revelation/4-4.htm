The number twenty-four is often interpreted as symbolic, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles, thus encompassing the entirety of God's people, both Old and New Testament believers. This reflects the unity and continuity of God's covenant people throughout history. The placement of these thrones around the central throne indicates a subordinate yet significant role in the divine order, suggesting a heavenly council or assembly.<p><b>and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders</b><br>The elders are often seen as representative figures of the church or the redeemed. In ancient Israel, elders were leaders and decision-makers, which aligns with the role these elders play in the heavenly vision. Their presence in heaven signifies the fulfillment of God's promises to His people and their participation in His eternal kingdom. The elders' role in worship and their proximity to God's throne highlight their honored status and the intimate relationship between God and His people.<p><b>dressed in white</b><br>White garments symbolize purity, righteousness, and victory. In biblical times, white clothing was often associated with festivity and celebration. The elders' attire reflects their sanctified state, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>. This imagery underscores the theme of redemption and the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice, which enables believers to stand blameless before God.<p><b>with golden crowns on their heads</b><br>Crowns in the biblical context often represent authority, honor, and reward. The use of gold signifies value and purity. These crowns are likely the "crown of life" or "crown of righteousness" mentioned in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a> and <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>, awarded to those who have remained faithful. The elders' crowns indicate their victorious status and the rewards of faithfulness, echoing the promises made to the overcomers in the letters to the seven churches earlier in Revelation. The act of wearing crowns also points to the believers' participation in Christ's reign, as they share in His victory and glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne.htm">The Throne</a></b><br>Central to the vision, representing God's sovereign rule and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty-four_thrones.htm">Twenty-Four Thrones</a></b><br>Surrounding God's throne, symbolizing a place of honor and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty-four_elders.htm">Twenty-Four Elders</a></b><br>Seated on the thrones, they are dressed in white and wear golden crowns, indicating purity and victory.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/white_garments.htm">White Garments</a></b><br>Symbolic of righteousness and purity, often associated with the redeemed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/golden_crowns.htm">Golden Crowns</a></b><br>Represent victory, authority, and reward, often given to those who have overcome.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_authority_and_worship.htm">Symbolism of Authority and Worship</a></b><br>The twenty-four elders represent the fullness of God's people, both Old and New Testament believers, who are given authority and a place in God's presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purity_and_righteousness.htm">Purity and Righteousness</a></b><br>The white garments signify the righteousness of the saints, reminding believers of the call to live holy lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_and_reward.htm">Victory and Reward</a></b><br>The golden crowns symbolize the victory believers have in Christ and the rewards awaiting those who remain faithful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_worship.htm">Heavenly Worship</a></b><br>The scene emphasizes the importance of worship and reverence for God, encouraging believers to prioritize worship in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_redeemed.htm">Role of the Redeemed</a></b><br>The elders' presence around the throne highlights the role of the redeemed in God's eternal plan, encouraging believers to live with an eternal perspective.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_4_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 4:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_do_24_elders_symbolize_in_church.htm">What do the "twenty-four elders" symbolize in Revelation 4:4 within church tradition?

Various reasons have been suggested why they should be described as twenty-four in number; they are the twelve tribes doubled, to signify the union of the Gentile with the Jewish Church; they are the two sets of twelve, to represent the two Testaments; they are the twelve Patriarchs cojoined with the twelve Apostles. It will be seen that these were all different forms of the same thought, that the twenty-four elders represent the complete Church of God in the past and in the future, in the Jewish and Gentile worlds; and as such the true spiritual successors, as priests to God, of those twenty-four courses (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/24-1.htm" title="Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:1-19</a>) arranged by David, and which some have thought gave rise to the use of the number twenty-four in this passage.

The same thought is touched upon in the double song of Moses and the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/15-3.htm" title="And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints.">Revelation 15:3</a>), and in the gates and foundations of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-12.htm" title="And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:">Revelation 21:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And round about the throne were four and twenty seats</span>. Throughout the vision no past tense is used. The vision represents the worship of heaven (so far as it can be presented to human understanding) as it continues eternally. <span class="accented">Thrones.. seats.</span> Render both by the same English word, as in the Revised Version. Some doubt is attached to the case of the first <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, is found in B, P; and this makes the construction nominative after <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;</span> (cf. ver. 2); but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, 34, 35, read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, which causes <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to be understood. The point is immaterial, as the meaning is the same. <span class="cmt_word">And upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting</span>. Omit "I saw" (see above). The number twenty-four, the double of twelve, represents the Churches of both the old and the new covenants. The elders are the heads or representatives of the body to which they belong (see <a href="/exodus/19-7.htm">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, and many others; see also the list of <span class="accented">elders</span> in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a>.). In the Christian Church the same distinction exists (see <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>, "ordained them <span class="accented">elders</span>;" <a href="/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a>, St. Paul sent for <span class="accented">the elders</span> of Ephesus; <a href="/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>, "The elders were present"). So here the <span class="accented">elders</span> represent the saints of both the Old and New Testaments. Thus they offer "the prayers of the saints" (<a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>). Christ, moreover, promised twelve thrones to his disciples (<a href="/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>) though not to the exclusion of the saints of old, for both are conjoined in <a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14</a>. In <a href="/revelation/15-2.htm">Revelation 15:2, 3</a>, the victorious ones sing "the song of <span class="accented">Moses</span> and of the <span class="accented">Lamb."</span> Other interpretations which have been advanced are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the twenty-four elders represent the great and minor prophets (St. Hippolytus); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> higher angels - the celestial priesthood, as denoted by their white garments and the number twenty-four, the number of courses of the Levitical priesthood (Reuss); <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> simply angels (Hoffmann);  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Surrounding</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#965;&#954;&#955;&#972;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(kyklothen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2943.htm">Strong's 2943: </a> </span><span class="str2">In a circle round, round about.
