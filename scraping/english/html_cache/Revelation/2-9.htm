Historically, Smyrna was a wealthy city, yet the Christians there were often marginalized and economically disadvantaged due to their faith. The "affliction" refers to the persecution and trials they endured. Despite their material poverty, they are described as "rich" in spiritual terms, echoing Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a> about storing treasures in heaven. This richness is in their faith, perseverance, and spiritual blessings, aligning with <a href="/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>, which speaks of the poor being rich in faith.<p><b>And I am aware of the slander of those who falsely claim to be Jews,</b><br>The "slander" refers to false accusations and malicious gossip aimed at the Christians by those who claimed Jewish identity. In the first-century context, some Jews in Smyrna may have been hostile to Christians, viewing them as a heretical sect. This aligns with the broader New Testament narrative where early Christians often faced opposition from Jewish communities, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>. The phrase "falsely claim to be Jews" suggests a spiritual rather than ethnic identity, indicating that true Jewishness is defined by faith in Christ, as Paul discusses in <a href="/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>.<p><b>but are in fact a synagogue of Satan.</b><br>This strong language indicates that these opponents, while claiming to be God's people, are actually serving the purposes of Satan by opposing the gospel. The term "synagogue of Satan" suggests a gathering that is contrary to God's will, similar to how Jesus referred to some religious leaders as children of the devil in <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>. This phrase underscores the spiritual battle between the forces of God and Satan, a recurring theme in Revelation. It also highlights the idea that true allegiance to God is demonstrated through faith in Christ, not merely ethnic or religious identity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_church_in_smyrna.htm">The Church in Smyrna</a></b><br>One of the seven churches addressed in the Book of Revelation, located in a wealthy city known for its beauty and commercial success.

"We go from one hour to another, from one day and year to another, and what is once fairly past in our doing and omitting and suffering is scarcely regarded by us any more; it is like water that has flowed away.

The Jews, "as was their wont," were foremost in bringing logs for the pile.<p><span class= "bld">Synagogue of</span> <span class= "bld">Satan.</span>--The word "synagogue" is only once used to describe the Christian assembly (<a href="/james/2-2.htm" title="For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;">James 2:2</a>); and even there it is called "<span class= "ital">your</span> synagogue," not the "synagogue of God." In all other instances the "word is abandoned by the Jews." With the "synagogue of Satan" here, compare "the throne of Satan" (<a href="/revelation/2-13.htm" title="I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan's seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.">Revelation 2:13</a>), "the depths of Satan" (<a href="/revelation/2-24.htm" title="But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.">Revelation 2:24</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty</span>. "Thy works" has been inserted here and in ver. 13 in order to make the opening of all seven epistles alike. The uncials A, C, P, and the Vulgate, Coptic, and AEthiopic Versions omit the words in each place. The Sinaiticus inserts them here and omits them in ver. 13, where they are plainly awkward in construction. Like all wealthy cities, Smyrna showed the extremes of wealth and poverty side by side. It would be among the poor that Christians would in the first instance be found, and their Christianity would lead to their spoliation; in this much of their "tribulation" would consist. But thou art rich (compare the close parallel, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-2.htm">2 Corinthians 8:2</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the blasphemy from them which say they are Jews, and they are not.</span> We have here strong evidence of the early date of the Apocalypse. Throughout this book "Jew" is an honourable name for the worshippers of the Christ; "Gentiles," a name of reproach for those who oppose the Christ (<a href="/revelation/2-9.htm">Revelation 2:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2, 18</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3, 23</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, etc.). These persecutors of the Church of Smyrna are Jews in name, but in reality are rather Gentiles - opponents, and not worshippers of the Messiah. The view taken in the Fourth Gospel is utterly different. There "the Jews" are almost invariably the opponents of Christ; the word occurs about seventy times, and nearly always with this shade of meaning. Assume that the Gospel was written a quarter of a century later than the Apocalypse, and there is nothing strange in this. Long experience of Jewish malignity in opposing the gospel has changed the apostle's views respecting his countrymen. He has become fully convinced of the inveterate and widespread character of the national apostasy. To him "the Jews" have become synonymous with the enemies of the cross of Christ. Assume that the Apocalypse was written about the same time as the Gospel, and how shall we account for this utter difference of view in the two books? Assume that the Gospel was written long before the Apocalypse, and how shall we explain the fact that experience of Jewish hostility has turned the apostle's abhorrence of "the Jews" into such admiration that to him a Jew has become synonymous with a believer in Jesus Christ? It is remarkable that, in the 'Martyrdom of St. Polycarp,' the Jews are said to have been present in great numbers, and to have been foremost (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) in collecting wood with which to burn him alive. <span class="cmt_word">A synagogue of Satan</span> (comp. <a href="/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>; <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>).
