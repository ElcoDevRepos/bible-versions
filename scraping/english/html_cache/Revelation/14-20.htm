The location "outside the city" is significant, as it often symbolizes a place of judgment and exclusion from the holy city, Jerusalem. In biblical times, winepresses were located outside city limits, and this imagery is used to convey the severity and separation of divine judgment. The city likely refers to Jerusalem, a central place in biblical prophecy and eschatology.<p><b>and the blood that flowed from it</b><br>The flowing blood symbolizes the outpouring of divine wrath and judgment. This imagery is consistent with apocalyptic literature, where blood often represents the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. The blood flowing from the winepress signifies the magnitude of judgment upon those who oppose God.<p><b>rose as high as the bridles of the horses</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the extent and severity of the judgment. Horses were common in ancient warfare, and their bridles would be about four to five feet high. The imagery suggests a catastrophic and overwhelming judgment, indicating that the consequences of sin are vast and inescapable.<p><b>for a distance of 1,600 stadia</b><br>A stadion was an ancient Greek unit of length, approximately 607 feet. Therefore, 1,600 stadia would be about 184 miles. This specific measurement may symbolize completeness or totality, as the number 1,600 is the square of 40, a number often associated with testing and judgment in the Bible.

The description, of course, implies the terrific nature of the punishment - probably nothing more. In the same way the distance mentioned is no doubt intended to denote the extensive nature of the punishment, though why that particular number is chosen is not absolutely clear. Possibly it is derived from the square of 4 multiplied by the square of 10; four being significant of the created world (see on Revelation 4:6), and ten being the sign of completeness (see on Revelation 13:1); the number thus portraying completeness as regards the created world, and the inability of any one to escape God's judgment. <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
