The number seven frequently symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, suggesting that these thunders represent a complete or perfect message from God. The thunders may be seen as a form of divine judgment or revelation, similar to the seven seals, trumpets, and bowls found elsewhere in Revelation. The imagery of thunder is often associated with God's voice and power, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>, where the voice of the Lord is described as powerful and majestic, breaking cedars and shaking the wilderness.<p><b>I was about to put it in writing</b><br>John, the author of Revelation, is prepared to record the message of the seven thunders, indicating his role as a faithful scribe of divine revelation. This readiness to write aligns with his task throughout Revelation, where he documents the visions and messages he receives. The act of writing is significant in the biblical context, as it serves to preserve and communicate God's word to future generations, as seen in other scriptural instances like <a href="/jeremiah/30-2.htm">Jeremiah 30:2</a>, where God instructs Jeremiah to write down all the words He has spoken.<p><b>But I heard a voice from heaven saying</b><br>The "voice from heaven" is a recurring motif in Revelation, often representing divine authority or instruction. This voice interrupts John's intention to write, indicating a higher command or purpose. The heavenly voice underscores the divine origin and authority of the message, similar to other instances in the Bible where God speaks from heaven, such as during Jesus' baptism in <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. This voice serves as a reminder of the sovereignty and mystery of God's plans, which are not always revealed to humanity.<p><b>&#8220;Seal up what the seven thunders have said</b><br>The command to "seal up" the message of the seven thunders suggests that certain aspects of God's revelation are meant to remain hidden or undisclosed. This concept of sealing is reminiscent of <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, where Daniel is instructed to seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. The sealing indicates that some divine mysteries are not yet meant for human understanding, emphasizing the theme of God's inscrutable wisdom and timing. It also highlights the selective nature of revelation, where some truths are revealed while others are concealed.<p><b>and do not write it down.&#8221;</b><br>The instruction not to write down the message of the seven thunders further emphasizes the theme of divine mystery and the limits of human knowledge. This prohibition contrasts with the general directive given to John to record his visions, as seen in <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>. The withholding of this specific revelation serves as a reminder of the partial nature of human understanding and the need for faith in God's ultimate plan. It also reflects the tension between revealed and hidden knowledge, a common theme in apocalyptic literature, where certain truths are reserved for God's timing and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives visions while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_thunders.htm">Seven Thunders</a></b><br>A mysterious and powerful voice or series of voices that John hears, which are not to be recorded.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/voice_from_heaven.htm">Voice from Heaven</a></b><br>A divine command that instructs John not to write down the message of the seven thunders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/patmos.htm">Patmos</a></b><br>The island where John receives the Revelation, a place of exile and divine encounter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The realm from which the authoritative voice speaks, indicating divine origin and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_mystery_and_human_limitation.htm">Divine Mystery and Human Limitation</a></b><br>God's wisdom and plans often include mysteries beyond human comprehension.

Our part is to trust the Sovereign Lord, obey the light we have, and await the perfect unveiling of all things when Christ returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And when the seven </span>. . .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice out of the heaven</span>, <span class= "ital">saying, Seal up the things which the. seven thunders spoke, and write them not.</span> He could have written down their utterances.

The utterances, then, are for those who hear them; they are not to be made generally known. Is it not the solemn, sacred, divine voice not to be known by all, but by those who have ears to hear when "the God of glory thundereth?" "Lo ! He doth send forth His voice, yea, and that a mighty voice" (<a href="/psalms/68-33.htm" title="To him that rides on the heavens of heavens, which were of old; see, he does send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.">Psalm 68:33</a>). Mankind may hear the thunder; only those whose ears God has opened can hear the utterances and the inspiriting messages which they bring. So was it once in our Lord's life. The people said it thundered; some thought an angel spake; but there were articulate words which He who came to do God's will, in whose heart was God's law, heard, and to Him that thunderlike voice promised to "glorify His name" (<a href="/context/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28-29</a>). Similarly here, the Evangelist (who is in this but a type of the true witnesses for God), who is to prophecy before peoples and kings (<a href="/revelation/10-11.htm" title="And he said to me, You must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.">Revelation 10:11</a>), hears words spoken by the divine voice which make him strong for his mission.

In <a href="/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11, 12, 13</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5, 15</a>, the <span class="accented">voice</span> appears to be that of Christ or God the Father. In <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a> it may be that of Christ or an angel; in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a> it seems to be the angel's voice; and in <a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a> it apparently proceeds from the four living beings; while in <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>, although the command appears to be the command of God, the locality from which the voice issues appears to bear reference to the souls of the saints, and their cry for vengeance. Here it seems best to identify the "voice from heaven" with that of <a href="/revelation/1.htm">Revelation 1</a>, where it is probably Christ himself (see on Revelation 1:10). <span class="cmt_word">Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not</span> (cf. <a href="/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a>, "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end;" also <a href="/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power;" also <a href="/revelation/22-10.htm">Revelation 22:10</a>, "And he saith unto me. Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand"). As stated in the note on ver. 2, not all God's purposes are revealed. Here we have a positive indication that some truths are withheld. It is useless to speculate on the nature of that which is purposely concealed from us. The probable conclusions which we may deduce are well put by Alford: "From the very character of thunder, that the utterances were of fearful import; from the place which they hold, that they relate to the Church; from the command to conceal them, first, encouragement, that God in his tender mercy to his own does not reveal all his terrors; secondly, godly fear, seeing that the arrows of his quiver are not exhausted, but besides things expressly foretold, there are more behind not revealed to us." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/10-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
