It was known for its wealth and as a center of commerce and trade. In the context of Revelation, Sardis represents a church that has a reputation for being alive but is spiritually dead. The mention of "a few people" indicates a remnant of faithful believers within a largely complacent church. This concept of a faithful remnant is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the stories of Noah and Lot, and in the remnant of Israel mentioned in the Old Testament.<p><b>who have not soiled their garments</b><br>In biblical times, garments often symbolized one's spiritual state. To have "soiled garments" would imply moral or spiritual impurity. The faithful in Sardis are commended for maintaining their purity and not succumbing to the moral decay around them. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/zechariah/3-3.htm">Zechariah 3:3-5</a>, where clean garments represent righteousness and divine approval.<p><b>and because they are worthy</b><br>The worthiness mentioned here is not based on human merit but on their faithfulness and perseverance in the face of spiritual decline. This echoes the biblical theme that true worthiness comes from living a life aligned with God's will, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37-38</a>, where Jesus speaks of the cost of discipleship.<p><b>they will walk with Me in white</b><br>Walking with Christ in white garments symbolizes victory, purity, and eternal life. White garments are often associated with the redeemed in Revelation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9 and 19</a>:8, where the saints are depicted in white robes. This promise of walking with Christ reflects the ultimate reward for those who remain faithful, drawing a parallel to the promise of eternal fellowship with God found throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sardis.htm">Sardis</a></b><br>An ancient city in Asia Minor, known for its wealth and as a center of trade.

(Comp. also <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.">Revelation 2:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - But thou hast a few names in Sardis. The "but" (Revised Version) must be added, and the "even" (Authorized Version) omitted, on conclusive evidence. "Names" is here used in the sense of persons (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a> and <a href="/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>, where the Revised Version has "persons"); there is no reference to the totally different use of "to have a name" in ver. 1. Bode remarks, "He knoweth his own sheep by name, as he knew Moses by name, and writeth the names of his own in heaven." These few are like the few righteous in Sodom. Though they consent to abide in the Church, they do not leaven it, nor does their presence save it: "They shall deliver but their own souls by their righteousness" (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 16, 18, 20</a>). The word for "defile" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs only here, <a href="/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>, and <a href="/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>. Its radical meaning is "to besmear," and so "to befoul." That of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>; <a href="/titus/1-15.htm">Titus 1:15</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>; <a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>) is rather "to stain," which is not necessarily "to befoul." That of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11-20</a>; <a href="/mark/7-15.htm">Mark 7:15-23</a>; <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>; <a href="/acts/11-9.htm">Acts 11:9</a>; <a href="/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13</a>) is "to make common or profane." In most cases all these three are rendered "defile" in our version. These few in Sardis have kept themselves "unspotted from the world" in which they live. Neither the corruption of heathendom nor the torpor of a moribund Church has infected them. Their contact with a dead body has imparted no life to the body and no defilement to them. There is no need to press the metaphor and give a special meaning to "garments" - whether their souls, or their bodies, or their consciences, or their baptismal robes. The metaphor is implied in "putting on the new man" (<a href="/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>), "putting on Christ" (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>), where the word for "put on" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to be clothed with." They shall walk with me. In accordance with Christ's high-priestly prayer (<a href="/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>; comp. Roy. 21:24). In white. This elliptical expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) for "in white robes" occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>, and is another small link between the two books. The word "white" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), excepting in <a href="/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a> and <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>, is in the New Testament always used of <span class="accented">heavenly</span> purity and brightness. Thus also Plato, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;</span> ('Laws,' 956); and Virgil of the souls in the other world, "Omnibus his hives cinguntur tempora vitta" ('AEneid,' 6:665). (See notes on Revelation 1:14.) As we might expect, the word is specially frequent in Revelation. Of course, the white garments referred to here, vers. 5, 18, and <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>, are quite different from the undefiled garments just mentioned. The one is the imperfect purity of struggling saints on earth, the other the perfect purity of glorified saints in heaven. The promise, therefore, is threefold. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> They shall walk, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they shall have life and liberty. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They shall have Christ as their constant Companion. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> They shall be in unsullied glory.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#955;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Alla)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_235.htm">Strong's 235: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, except, however.
