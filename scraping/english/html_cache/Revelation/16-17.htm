The pouring out of the bowl into the air signifies a comprehensive and all-encompassing judgment, as the air is a universal element that surrounds the earth. In biblical symbolism, the air can also represent the realm of spiritual forces, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, where Satan is referred to as the "prince of the power of the air." This suggests that this judgment may have implications for both the physical and spiritual realms.<p><b>and a loud voice came from the throne in the temple</b><br>The loud voice signifies authority and the importance of the proclamation. The voice coming from the throne indicates that this is a divine decree, emanating from God's sovereign authority. The mention of the temple connects this event to the heavenly temple, which is a central theme in Revelation, symbolizing God's presence and holiness. The temple imagery also recalls the Old Testament, where the temple was the dwelling place of God among His people, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a> during Solomon's dedication of the temple.<p><b>saying, &#8220;It is done!&#8221;</b><br>The declaration "It is done!" echoes the completion of God's plan and the fulfillment of His purposes. This phrase parallels Jesus' words on the cross, "It is finished" (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), signifying the completion of His redemptive work. In Revelation, this statement marks the culmination of God's judgment and the ushering in of the new creation. It reflects the prophetic assurance found in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning, affirming His sovereign control over history.

The best authorities omit "of heaven."

(On the characteristic <span class="accented">great voice</span>, see on Revelation 6:1, etc.) The same voice as in ver. 1, probably that of God himself, as the words, "from the throne," seem also to show. It is noticeable that here, as in the seal visions and trumpet visions, we are not explicitly informed of the nature of the last vision. We have the accompanying circumstances described in ver. 18, which are always attendant on the last great manifestation, but the end itself is left unrecorded. In the seals, the last vision is described by the silence in heaven; in the trumpets, the nature of the last judgment is only vaguely alluded to in the triumphant heavenly song. So here, only a brief summary is given (vers. 18, 19) of what actually falls as the last extremity of God's wrath; a fuller account is reserved for <a href="/revelation/19.htm">Revelation 19</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/16-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
