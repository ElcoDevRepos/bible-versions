Angels often serve as messengers in biblical texts, conveying divine revelations. This interaction underscores the heavenly authority and the importance of the message being delivered. In the context of Revelation, angels frequently guide John through his visions, providing explanations and insights into the symbolic imagery he witnesses.<p><b>The waters you saw</b><br>Waters in biblical prophecy often symbolize chaos, danger, or the masses of humanity. In Revelation, waters can represent the tumultuous and unstable nature of the world. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references, such as in <a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>, where nations are compared to the roaring of many waters. The waters here are part of a vision involving a prostitute, symbolizing a corrupt and influential power.<p><b>where the prostitute was seated</b><br>The prostitute, often referred to as "Babylon the Great," symbolizes a corrupt and idolatrous system or city that exerts significant influence over the world. Her seating on the waters suggests dominion and control over the peoples and nations represented by the waters. This imagery draws from Old Testament depictions of unfaithfulness and idolatry, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>, where Babylon is described as dwelling by many waters.<p><b>are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the global influence and reach of the entity symbolized by the prostitute. The use of "peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues" highlights the diversity and vastness of those under her sway. It reflects the universal scope of the vision, indicating that the corrupting influence extends across different ethnicities, cultures, and languages. This mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where the gospel is to be preached to all nations, contrasting the spread of corruption with the spread of the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who provides John with the interpretation of the vision.

&#8220;Then the angel said to me&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>a) shows the same angel from 17:1 personally clarifying the vision, just as angels often do in Scripture (<a href="/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>; 17:7; <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement underscores that the explanation comes from a divine messenger, so it carries the full authority of heaven.<p>&#8226; Because the angel interprets the symbolism, we can trust the meaning is precise and not left to speculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The waters you saw</b><p>&#8226; The phrase points back to 17:1, where the prostitute is pictured &#8220;sitting on many waters.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In prophetic passages, large bodies of water can be literal (<a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>) but frequently symbolize masses of people in agitation or unrest (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-13.htm">Jeremiah 51:13</a>).<p>&#8226; John is reminded that what he observed is not a new vision but an element already shown, keeping the scene cohesive and reinforcing that Scripture interprets Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where the prostitute was seated</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;prostitute&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-1.htm">Revelation 17:1, 5</a>) represents a corrupt, worldwide religious-political system opposed to God (cf. <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2, 7</a>).<p>&#8226; Her &#8220;seated&#8221; position suggests influence, control, and apparent stability over the waters. <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a> uses the imagery of sitting to denote authority; likewise, here the harlot exercises global sway.<p>&#8226; This detail emphasizes that the waters are the very base of her power, not a distant backdrop.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues</b><p>&#8226; The angel&#8217;s plain words remove all ambiguity: &#8220;The waters &#8230; are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>b).<p>&#8226; By grouping four terms, the Spirit highlights:<p>&#8211; Peoples: distinct ethnic groups<p>&#8211; Multitudes: vast numbers (cf. <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>)<p>&#8211; Nations: political entities (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>)<p>&#8211; Tongues: linguistic diversity (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>)<p>&#8226; The harlot&#8217;s reach is therefore universal, spanning every demographic category on earth.<p>&#8226; This matches earlier prophecy that earthly kings and merchants are entangled with her (<a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a>; 18:3), confirming her pervasive influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> gives God&#8217;s own interpretation of the vision: the &#8220;many waters&#8221; under the prostitute are the world&#8217;s populations in all their ethnic, political, and linguistic variety. An angel delivers this explanation so we may grasp that the future &#8220;Babylon&#8221; rules over real, literal people across the globe. The verse assures us that Scripture itself clarifies its symbols, revealing a coming worldwide system that wields authority over humanity until God brings it to judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And he said unto me . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the angel mentioned in <a href="/revelation/17-1.htm" title="And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:">Revelation 17:1</a>) <span class= "ital">saith, &c.</span> The waters on which the harlot sits are explained as "multitudes."

The wild beast and the harlot both draw much of their power from the people. The easily-moved passions or the fickle crowd, its generous, unreasoning impulses, are used by subtle and seductive enemies. "Men never so much need to be theocratic as when they are most democratic," said De Tocqueville. They need to recognise God as their King, then, most when their new discovered strength is likely to be made the tool of unscrupulous ambition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saith unto me.</span> As in ver. 7, these words form the preface to a particular description.
