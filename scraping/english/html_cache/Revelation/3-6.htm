It echoes the words of Jesus in the Gospels, such as in <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a> and <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His teachings. The "ear" symbolizes the ability to comprehend and respond to spiritual truths, suggesting that not everyone will be receptive to the message.<p><b>let him hear</b><br>The imperative "let him hear" underscores the responsibility of the listener to actively engage with the message. In the biblical context, hearing implies obedience and action, not just passive listening. This is consistent with the Jewish understanding of "Shema" (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>), which means to hear and obey. The call to hear is a recurring theme in Revelation, emphasizing the urgency and importance of the message.<p><b>what the Spirit says</b><br>The reference to "the Spirit" highlights the divine origin of the message. In the context of Revelation, the Spirit is the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's will to the churches. This aligns with the role of the Holy Spirit as the revealer of truth, as seen in <a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>. The Spirit's involvement indicates that the message is not merely human wisdom but divine revelation.<p><b>to the churches</b><br>The plural "churches" indicates that the message is intended for multiple congregations, specifically the seven churches in Asia Minor addressed in Revelation chapters 2 and 3. These churches represent different spiritual conditions and challenges faced by believers. The historical context of these churches, such as their geographical locations and cultural environments, provides insight into the specific issues they encountered. The message to the churches also serves as a timeless exhortation to all believers, emphasizing the universal relevance of the Spirit's words.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>Refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates God's message to the churches.
