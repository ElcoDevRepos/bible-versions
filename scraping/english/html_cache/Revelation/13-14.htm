These signs are reminiscent of the miracles performed by the prophets of God, but here they serve to deceive. The ability to perform signs is a recurring theme in Scripture, often used to validate a divine message (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/4.htm">Exodus 4:1-9</a>). However, in this context, the signs are deceptive, aligning with warnings in <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a> about false prophets performing great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.<p><b>it deceived those who dwell on the earth</b><br>The deception of the earth's inhabitants is a central theme in apocalyptic literature, emphasizing the spiritual blindness and susceptibility of humanity to falsehoods. This deception is a fulfillment of the warnings given by Jesus and the apostles about the end times (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9-11</a>). The phrase "those who dwell on the earth" often refers to unbelievers in Revelation, contrasting with those whose citizenship is in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p><b>telling them to make an image to the beast</b><br>The creation of an image is reminiscent of idolatry condemned throughout the Old Testament, such as the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. This act of making an image signifies allegiance and worship, directly opposing the worship of God. The image serves as a focal point for the beast's power and a test of loyalty for the inhabitants of the earth, paralleling the demands of totalitarian regimes throughout history for absolute devotion.<p><b>that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived</b><br>This phrase refers to the first beast's apparent resurrection, a counterfeit of Christ's resurrection. The wound by the sword suggests a mortal injury, yet the beast's survival is a perversion of the resurrection theme central to Christian faith. This false resurrection is designed to inspire awe and allegiance, mimicking the power of Christ's victory over death (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). The imagery here is a stark reminder of the antichrist's attempt to usurp Christ's rightful place as the object of worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_beast.htm">The Second Beast</a></b><br>Often referred to as the "false prophet," this beast performs signs and deceives the inhabitants of the earth.

Staying anchored to the Word keeps believers discerning when wonder-working deceit rises on the world stage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">And deceiveth</span> <span class= "bld">them . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And he leads astray those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which were given him to do in the presence of the wild beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, to make an image to the wild beast that has the stroke of the sword and lived.</span> He leads astray: this is the key to his success, he deifies the spirit of worldliness; but he does it by deception and subtlety: there is an appearance of wonderful power: he can work lying wonders. When men lose the sense of duty,--the will to ask, "Is it right?"--they become an easy prey to some specious deception. This is the reason that, both in the old and new dispensations, a caution against "immoral marvels" is entered (see <a href="/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1-3</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>; and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a>); mere greatness, either of achievement or of miracle, is no guarantee of a good cause. The motto "Might is right is the motto of worldliness; "Right is might" is the motto of faith, and those who hold it cannot worship the beast, even though the stroke of his death-wound is healed. Men have appealed to lying miracles on behalf of a death-wounded creed: the cleverness of self-interested partisanship is seldom barren of imposing expedients.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast,</span> he deceives by employing false signs, and he deceives by inducing men to believe that the worship of the first beast is allowable. Those "that dwell on the earth" are the worldly minded, as in ver. 12. "Which he had power to do" should rather be "which it was given him to do," as in the Revised Version. The power possessed by the beast does not originate with himself; he possesses it only subject to the will of God (cf. vers. 5 and 7). Thus the second beast - self deceit - beguiles men. They accept exhibitions of power external to God as evidences of an independence and self sufficiency which do not exist apart from God, forgetful of the fact that this power is derived from God: <span class="accented">it is given</span> by him. (For "in the sight of the beast," see on ver. 12.) <span class="cmt_word">Saying to them that dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "saying," masculine, agrees with the neuter <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The writer uses the masculine, as in ver. 8, because of the personified nature of the beast. It is not fair to press the word (as some writers do) into the signification that a man must be intended. "Them that dwell on the earth" - the worldly minded (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live;</span> <span class="accented">who hath the stroke of a sword, and lived</span>, as in the Revised Version. The masculine as before (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>). This beast suggested that men should set up an image of the first beast, not in order to pay greater honour to the first beast, but that an apparent alternative might be offered to men, so that those who hesitated to pay direct allegiance to the first beast might overcome their scruples and worship something which resembled him, while allowing them to, as it were, cheat their own consciences by persuading themselves that they were not worshipping the beast himself. These two classes of men are, of course, essentially one; they are, in reality, all followers of the beast; but still there is a difference in the manner in which they become worshippers of the beast. The distinction of the two classes seems to be kept in mind in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> and Revelation 20:4, where, however, all are included in the same condemnation. Thus the apostle teaches us that those who, by specious and plausible reasoning, who, in short, by self deceit, allow themselves to east in their lot with the worldly - the avowed followers of the first beast - are equally guilty with those who openly proclaim themselves followers of the world. (On the last part of the verse, the nature of the sword stroke, see on ver. 3.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
