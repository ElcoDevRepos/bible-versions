The ten horns often symbolize ten kings or kingdoms, indicating a coalition of power. The seven heads may represent completeness or fullness of authority, possibly alluding to the seven hills of Rome or seven successive empires. This beast is a representation of political and spiritual opposition to God, embodying the culmination of human rebellion.<p><b>rising out of the sea</b><br>In biblical literature, the sea often symbolizes chaos, evil, and the nations in turmoil (<a href="/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12-13</a>). The beast emerging from the sea suggests a rise from a place of disorder and opposition to God. This imagery connects to the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the sea as a symbol of chaos and the abode of evil forces. The sea's tumultuous nature reflects the unstable and rebellious nature of the beast's power.<p><b>There were ten royal crowns on its horns</b><br>The ten royal crowns signify authority and power, indicating that the beast's horns (or kings) possess significant political influence. This imagery suggests a confederation of rulers or nations under the beast's control. The crowns also imply a counterfeit authority, as true sovereignty belongs to God alone. This reflects the beast's attempt to usurp divine authority and establish its own dominion.<p><b>and blasphemous names on its heads</b><br>Blasphemous names indicate a direct challenge to God's holiness and authority. In the Roman context, emperors often claimed divine status, and the beast's blasphemous names reflect this arrogance and self-deification. This is a clear affront to the first commandment, which forbids placing any gods before the one true God. The blasphemy underscores the beast's role as an antichrist figure, opposing and mimicking Christ's rightful place.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, oppressive entity or empire that opposes God and His people.

It is true that the sentence has a connection with that chapter, but it is also closely linked with what follows. The way in which the dragon carries out his plan of war is described. Like Milton's "superior fiend," he stands upon the shore and summons his legions (<span class= "ital">Par. Lost, </span>Book I.) to another form of war. Two monsters, one distinguished by more brutal, the other by more subtle power, rise at his bidding.<p><span class= "bld">And saw . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And I saw a wild beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his heads names of blasphemy.</span>--The wild beast rises out of the sea. In the vision of Daniel (Revelation 7) the beasts rose out of the sea upon which the four winds strove. The sea represents the great, restless mass of human kind; or, as it is expressed in <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm" title="And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.">Revelation 17:15</a>, "peoples and multitudes." St. James represented an undecided man as a wave driven by the wind (<a href="/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>). The individuals, like larger and smaller waves, make up this great ocean-like mass of men, swayed by impulse or passion. Out of the sea rises a wild beast. The word is not the same as that used in <a href="/revelation/4-7.htm" title="And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.">Revelation 4:7</a> (see Note there), but is a word which implies the predominance of the beast nature. Whatever power rises is one which rules not by love or right, but by fear and wilfulness. It is the great force of the world-power, which in every age has been antagonistic to the power of right. The wild beast is always the figure of the kingdoms of this world--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the kingdoms which are founded on passion or selfishness. They are seven in number, as the beast had seven heads. We read afterwards of seven mountains. These world-powers are spoken of as mountains for their strength and stability; as heads of the wild beast because, though separate, they are inspired by the dragon spirit, the spirit of utter enmity to the rule of the Righteous King. The seven kingdoms, or heads of the wild beast, are more distinctly explained in <a href="/revelation/17-10.htm" title="And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.">Revelation 17:10</a>. There we read that five are fallen, one was in possession of power, and the seventh had not yet arisen. The key is thus placed in our hands. The sixth head is imperial Rome, the successor of those great world-powers which were, one and all, founded in unrighteousness--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in violation of the law of brotherly kindness and faith. The heads carry the names of blasphemy. The spirit of arrogant self-sufficiency characterised all the world-powers. Illustrations would be too numerous for our space. It is enough to refer to the spirit in Babylon: "Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?" The words were Nebuchadnezzar's (<a href="/daniel/4-30.htm" title="The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?">Daniel 4:30</a>). He became a beast in uttering them; but the spirit of them went through all the world-powers, from the days of Lamech (<a href="/context/genesis/4-23.htm" title="And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.">Genesis 4:23-24</a>) and Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm" title="And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad on the face of the whole earth.">Genesis 11:4</a>) to the days when Roman poets prostituted their pens in abject flattery of emperors, and a degraded people welcomed them as gods, and put those to death who refused to offer frankincense and wine to the images of those who wore the purple. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I stood upon the sand of the sea.</span> The Revised Version, agreeing with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, C, Vulgate, Syriac, AEthiopic, Armenian, Victorinus, reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "he stood." The Authorized Version follows the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I stood," which is found in B, P, Coptic, Andreas, Arethas. Fortunately, the point is not important. Whether St. John or the dragon stood on the edge of the sea is not material, since we are distinctly told that the ten-horned beast rose from the sea. Wordsworth aptly contrasts this station on the unstable sand in proximity to the sea, the clement of commotion, with the vision of the Lamb on Mount Zion (<a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1-5</a>). The imagery which follows is founded upon the vision of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. The phrase should probably be joined on to the preceding passage, as in the Revised Version. The new vision then opens in the customary manner with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "I saw," as in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4, 5, 6, 7</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And saw a beast rise up out of the sea</span>. Supply "I," and make this the beginning of the fresh paragraph (see above). The one beast here takes the place of the four beasts of <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, and is distinguished by the characteristics of the first three (see on ver. 2). This beast arises from the <span class="accented">sea</span>, the second beast from the <span class="accented">earth</span> (see ver. 11). They are the instruments of the woe which is denounced against the <span class="accented">earth</span> and the <span class="accented">sea</span> in <a href="/revelation/12-12.htm">Revelation 12:12</a>. The <span class="accented">sea</span>, again, is the type of instability, confusion, and commotion, frequently signifying the ungovernable nations of the earth in opposition to the Church of God (cf. <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>). Probably this is the beast referred to in <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>, and (more fully) in <a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>. It is the power of the world which is directed towards the persecution of Christians. Having seven heads and ten horns. Nearly every manuscript has, <span class="accented">having ten horns and seven heads.</span> The order is reversed in <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> and Revelation 17:3; possibly the horns are mentioned first in this passage, because they are first seen as the beast rises from the sea. The essential identity of this beast with the dragon of <a href="/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a> is plainly shown. There Satan is described in his personal character; here he is described under the aspect of the persecuting power of the world. The symbolism is analogous to that found in <a href="/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>, where we may find the key to the interpretation. First, the <span class="accented">heads</span> signify dominion. The head is naturally looked upon as the chief, the controlling and guiding part of the body; that part to which all the members of the body are subject. This is the idea conveyed in <a href="/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a>. The third beast there is distinguished by the possession of four heads, and (we are immediately told) "dominion was given to it." <span class="accented">Seven</span>, as we have repeatedly seen, is the number typical of universality (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">seven, heads</span>, therefore, are symbolical of universal dominion. In the second place, <span class="accented">horns</span> are the type of power. Thus, in <a href="/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a>, the beast which is distinguished by the possession of the horns is described as being "diverse from all the beasts that were before it." It was "dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it" (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-17.htm">Psalm 132:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>, etc.). The number <span class="accented">ten</span> is the sign of completeness; not of universality or totality, but of sufficiency and abundancy for the purpose in view (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>, the ten righteous wanting at Sodom; <a href="/exodus/27-12.htm">Exodus 27:12</a>, the ten pillars of the tabernacle; the ten commandments; the tithe; <a href="/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">ten horns</span>, therefore, denote plenitude of power. The words of this passage thus signify that the beast should possess worldwide dominion and ample power. These are the qualities ascribed to the power which Satan now directs against the "seed of the woman." At the time of the writing of the Apocalypse, this power was evidently heathen Rome; but the meaning may be extended to embrace all the forms which this world opposition has assumed, whether Roman, Mohammedan, or Gothic, etc. It is consequently unnecessary, as it certainly seems fruitless, to attempt to interpret the <span class="accented">heads</span> and <span class="accented">horns</span> of individual nations and kings. In endeavouring to do so, many writers have imported into the description here given other details from Daniel, or deduced by themselves, for which there is no warrant in the narrative here supplied. For the same reason, it is useless to inquire into the disposition of the <span class="accented">ten horns</span> and <span class="accented">seven heads</span>; since the whole is a figure intended to convey certain ideas, and is not a description of an actual bodily form. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his horns ten crowns.</span> "Ten crowns;" <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, crowns denoting sovereignty; not <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the victor's wreath. The <span class="accented">crowns</span> upon the <span class="accented">horns</span> denote the sovereign nature of the power with which the beast is invested. The nations of the world who have persecuted the Church of God have the chief rule in this world. <span class="cmt_word">And upon his heads the name of blasphemy.</span> The plural <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "names," adopted by the Revised Version, is found in A, B, Vulgate, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. Alford reads the singular <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P, Coptic, Andreas, Primasius. There is no article. Possibly each head bore a name, which was the same in each case, and which might therefore with equal propriety be described as <span class="accented">name</span> or <span class="accented">names.</span> "Upon his heads" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>); the accusative being used (as Afford suggests) because the action of inscription carries with it a tinge of motion. In the preceding clause we have the genitive Or; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, where the preposition denotes rest. We have no hint given as to what the <span class="accented">name</span> was; the nature only is indicated. St. John very possibly had in his mind the mitre of the high priest, upon the plate of which was inscribed, "Holiness to the Lord" (<a href="/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>). It is a "name of blasphemy;" that is, the worldly power, typified by this beast, denies the Divinity and might of the true God, and exalts itself above him. Bede, Hengstenberg, etc., see the fulfilment in the assumption by the Roman emperors of titles which belong rightly only to Christ - King of kings, Divus, etc. But the application is wider. As partial fulfilments of that which will never be completely fulfilled until the end of the world, we may mention Pharaoh, when he said, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>); Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>.); Herod Agrippa (<a href="/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>); as well as those since St. John's time who have blasphemed by denying the existence or omnipotence of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/13-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a beast</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#951;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(th&#275;rion)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2342.htm">Strong's 2342: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly: a wild beast, hence: any animal; met: a brute.
