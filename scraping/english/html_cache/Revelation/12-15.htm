The serpent represents Satan, as identified earlier in the chapter. The water like a river suggests a powerful and overwhelming force, possibly indicating false teachings, persecution, or deceit aimed at the Church, represented by the woman. This imagery echoes the Old Testament, where water often symbolizes chaos and destruction (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>, <a href="/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>). The serpent's attempt to use water as a weapon may also recall the flood narrative in Genesis, where God used water to judge the earth, but here it is a tool of the enemy.<p><b>to overtake the woman</b><br>The woman in <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a> is often interpreted as a symbol of God's people, Israel, or the Church. The serpent's intention to overtake her signifies an attempt to destroy or corrupt the faithful. This reflects the ongoing spiritual warfare between Satan and God's people throughout history. The woman&#8217;s portrayal as being pursued by the serpent aligns with the persecution faced by early Christians and the Church's struggles against heretical teachings and external threats.<p><b>and sweep her away in the torrent</b><br>The phrase "sweep her away in the torrent" suggests a violent and sudden destruction. This can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and tribulations faced by believers, where the enemy seeks to overwhelm them with adversity. The torrent may symbolize the overwhelming nature of false doctrines, societal pressures, or direct persecution. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where floods or torrents represent overwhelming trials (e.g., <a href="/psalms/124-4.htm">Psalm 124:4-5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>). The ultimate protection and deliverance of the woman, as described later in the chapter, highlight God's sovereignty and faithfulness in preserving His people despite the enemy's efforts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_serpent.htm">The Serpent</a></b><br>Symbolic of Satan, the serpent is depicted as the adversary of the woman and her offspring.

While the enemy uses overwhelming force, the broader passage affirms that the Lord sovereignly intervenes, preserves His faithful, and ultimately turns every flood into a testimony of His deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">And the serpent . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river, that he might make her to be carried away by the river.</span> The foe of the woman was described as a dragon for his cruelty and fierceness--as a serpent for his subtlety. The first attack on the woman is pictured as persecution by the dragon: from this she escapes by flight; but the subtlety of the enemy finds another device: the foe (now described as a serpent) pours forth water as a river to sweep away the woman. The emblem is nut uncommon in the Bible. Invasion is described as "an overflowing flood" (<a href="/context/jeremiah/46-7.htm" title="Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?">Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/8-7.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up on them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:">Isaiah 8:7-8</a>) The same emblem is used in <a href="/context/psalms/74-2.htm" title="Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old; the rod of your inheritance, which you have redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein you have dwelled.">Psalm 74:2-6</a> to describe the uprising of a people's ill-will. The floods, the rivers, the waves of the sea, are employed to express popular movements. The woman that cannot be destroyed by positive persecution may be swept away by a hostile public opinion. It is not the rulers alone who stand up against the Lord and His Church: an infuriated populace may be stirred up against them. The temper of the mob occasioned as much suffering and as many deaths in early Christian days as did the political authorities. Ill-regulated popular impulses, leading to violence and unwise action, whether nominally for Christianity or against it, have done enough of the devil's work in the world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the serpent cast out of his month water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood;</span> <span class="accented">cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a river</span>... <span class="accented">carried away by the river</span>. A <span class="accented">flood</span>, in the Old Testament, has several significations. It frequently expresses overwhelming misfortune. Thus <a href="/psalms/69-15.htm">Psalm 69:15</a>, "Let not the waterflood overflow me;" <a href="/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>, "Thou carriest them away as with a flood" (cf. also <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/46-7.htm">Jeremiah 46:7</a>; <a href="/amos/9-5.htm">Amos 9:5</a>, etc.). The <span class="accented">flood</span> is typical of every form of destruction with which the devil seeks to overwhelm the Church of God. At the period of the writing of the Apocalypse, it plainly symbolized the bitter persecutions to which Christians were subjected; but its meaning need not be limited to this one form of destruction. Thus all those writers are correct, so far as they go, who interpret the <span class="accented">flood of</span> the Mohammedan power, of heresy, of the Gothic invasion, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#954;</span> <span class="translit">(ek)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
