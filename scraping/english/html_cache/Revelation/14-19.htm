The imagery of the sickle is reminiscent of agricultural practices, specifically the harvest. In biblical times, a sickle was a tool used for reaping crops, symbolizing the gathering of people for judgment. The angel's action signifies a decisive moment where God&#8217;s judgment is executed. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe the end times as a harvest (<a href="/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>, <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>).<p><b>and gathered the grapes of the earth</b><br>The grapes symbolize the people who are subject to God's judgment. In the context of Revelation, the earth often represents humanity in its fallen state. The gathering of grapes can be seen as a metaphor for the collection of those who have rejected God. This imagery is also found in the Old Testament, where grapes and vineyards often symbolize Israel and, by extension, those who are unfaithful to God (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).<p><b>and he threw them into the great winepress of God&#8217;s wrath</b><br>The winepress is a powerful symbol of judgment and wrath. In ancient times, a winepress was used to crush grapes to extract juice, symbolizing the crushing of those who oppose God. The "great winepress of God&#8217;s wrath" indicates the severity and totality of divine judgment. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, where God is depicted as treading the winepress in anger. The concept of divine wrath is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's holiness and justice against sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger tasked with executing God's judgment.

This angel now acts, showing that judgment is carried out at God&#8217;s command, not randomly.<p>- The sickle pictures decisive, unstoppable action. When <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a> says, &#8220;The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all who cause sin,&#8221; it uses the same harvest image to stress certainty.<p>- &#8220;Over the earth&#8221; reminds us the scope is global. <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7&#8211;9</a> speaks of the Lord Jesus being &#8220;revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in blazing fire,&#8221; matching the same worldwide dimension.<p>- Taken literally, this scene unfolds during the future Day of the Lord, just before Christ&#8217;s visible return (<a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14&#8211;20</a> sets the time frame).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gathered the grapes of the earth</b><p>- Grapes stand for people whose rebellion has &#8220;fully ripened.&#8221; Verse 18 said, &#8220;the clusters of grapes on the vine of the earth are fully ripe,&#8221; echoing <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>: &#8220;Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe &#8230; the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.&#8221;<p>- Two harvests appear in this chapter: grain (verses 14&#8211;16) and grapes (verses 17&#8211;20). Grain pictures the righteous taken to safety; grapes picture the wicked gathered for judgment.<p>- Notice &#8220;of the earth.&#8221; These are earth-bound, not heaven-bound. <a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10</a> speaks of &#8220;those who dwell on the earth,&#8221; a repeated phrase for persistent unbelievers.<p>- The gathering implies separation.

The sickle reveals decisive action; the global harvest of grapes pictures unrepentant humanity finally ripe for punishment; the winepress portrays the fierce, holy wrath that follows. This verse assures believers of God&#8217;s justice and urges the world to seek the only refuge&#8212;salvation in Jesus Christ before the day of wrath arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19, 20) <span class= "bld">And the angel . . .</span>--The vine (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the vintage of the vine), when gathered, is cast into <span class= "ital">the winepress of the wrath of God, the great </span>(<span class= "ital">winepress</span>)<span class= "ital">. And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came forth blood out of the winepress as far as the bridles of the horses, from a thousand six hundred furlongs</span> (stadii). The outflow of the blood of the grapes pressed reached over a distance of sixteen hundred stadii. The treading of the winepress was a figure representing vengeance; the red juice of the grape strongly suggested the shedding of blood. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/63-2.htm" title="Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winefat?">Isaiah 63:2-4</a>.) The winepresses stood usually outside the city: it is so represented here, not without an allusion to those who fall under the weight of this judgment because they have refused the defence of the true city and sanctuary. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm" title="And I looked, and, see, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.">Revelation 14:1</a> and <a href="/context/psalms/132-17.htm" title="There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.">Psalm 132:17-18</a>.) The distance (sixteen hundred stadii), <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>four multiplied into itself and then multiplied by a hundred, is symbolical (such seems the most probable meaning) of a judgment complete and full, and reaching to all corners of the earth--"the whole world, of which Satan is called the prince, is judged, and condemned, and punished" (Dr. Currey). In the vintage and harvest is a piercing discrimination between the faithful fruit-bearing children of the King and the cowardly or selfish, whose hearts are for self and not for Christ, but who yield themselves servants to sin.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth.</span> This angel is described in quite a different manner from "him who sat on the cloud" (ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">And cast it into the great wine press of the wrath of God;</span> <span class="accented">into the wine press, the great</span> [winepress], etc. The feminine substantive has agreeing with it a masculine adjective. It is doubtful whether we ought to see in this anything more than a mere slip of grammar. Possibly the word is of either gender. It is connected with the festival of Bacchus. Wordsworth, however, accounts for the masculine form of the adjective by supposing that the writer wishes to give a stronger force to the word, and to emphasize the terrible nature of the wrath of God. We have the same image in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, and it seems derived from <a href="/isaiah/58.htm">Isaiah 58</a>, and <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>. Destruction by an enemy is alluded to as the gathering of grapes in <a href="/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>.
