In biblical context, "Hades" refers to the realm of the dead, akin to the Hebrew "Sheol." The act of throwing them into the lake of fire symbolizes the finality of their destruction. This imagery aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>, where Paul states that the last enemy to be destroyed is death. The lake of fire represents eternal judgment and is a recurring symbol in Revelation, indicating the complete eradication of sin and its consequences. Theologically, this event marks the end of the current order and the ushering in of a new creation where death no longer exists (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><b>This is the second death&#8212;the lake of fire.</b><br>The "second death" is a term used to describe eternal separation from God, contrasting with the first death, which is physical. The concept of the second death is introduced earlier in <a href="/revelation/2-11.htm">Revelation 2:11 and 20</a>:6, emphasizing its spiritual and eternal nature. The lake of fire is not merely a place of punishment but represents the ultimate consequence of rejecting God. In a broader biblical narrative, this underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of redemption through Jesus Christ. The second death serves as a warning and a call to repentance, highlighting the importance of faith in Christ to avoid this eternal fate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Represents the end of physical life and the separation of the soul from the body.

We then read, not "This is the second death"--as though the reference were to what went before--but, <span class= "ital">This is the second death, the lake of fire.</span> The last verse then follows, <span class= "ital">And if any was not found written in the book</span> (or, <span class= "ital">roll</span>)<span class= "ital"> of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</span> Thus, three times in these two short verses, like a refrain at the close of each clause, we have the terrible words "the lake of fire." Into this lake of fire Death and Hades are thrown. It is clearly figurative language, implying that Death, the last enemy (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1Corinthians 15:26</a>) is destroyed, together with Hades, who was personified as Death's escort (<a href="/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.">Revelation 6:8</a>). So we read in the next chapter (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm" title="And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.">Revelation 21:4</a>) "there shall be no more death." The lake of fire into which Death is thrown is the second death! We have read of this before in this book (<a href="/revelation/2-11.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.">Revelation 2:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-6.htm" title="Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection: on such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.">Revelation 20:6</a>). It is a death of which the first death--the physical death, now destroyed--was but a faint figure. It is a condition which needs no coarse exaggeration, or vulgar literalisation of the prophetic imagery, to heighten the horror of. Very awful is that spiritual death, which knows not and loves not God, and from which Christ has come to arouse us; more awful must be that second death, in which the spirit, no longer the sinning victim of hereditary evil, has become the victim of habitual choice of wrong, loving darkness rather than light, and choosing alienation rather than reconciliation--the husks of the swine rather than the Father's house. Of the full meaning of the words in their true and <span class= "ital">future force</span> we can have little conception. It is enough for us to remember two things: they are figurative, but they are figurative of <span class= "ital">something.</span><p><span class= "bld"> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;</span> <span class="accented">death and Hades</span> (see on ver. 13). <span class="accented">Lake of fire</span> (see on ver. 10).

The first death is the actual death of the body, and which is the natural result of that spiritually dead state into which, since the Fall, man is horn, and which is therefore, as it were, his normal state. In a similar manner, the first resurrection is the risen spiritual life of conversion; while the second resurrection is the resurrection of all men, and the bestowal of eternal life upon the just. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Death</span><br /><span class="grk">&#952;&#940;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(thanatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2288.htm">Strong's 2288: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, physical or spiritual.
