In the new creation, the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, does not rely on the sun or moon for light. This reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19-20</a>, where it is prophesied that the Lord will be an everlasting light. The absence of the sun and moon signifies the complete sufficiency and supremacy of God's presence, eliminating the need for created sources of light. This also symbolizes the end of time as we know it, as celestial bodies are often used to mark time.<p><b>because the glory of God illuminates the city</b><br>The glory of God, often associated with His divine presence and majesty, provides the light for the city. This recalls the Shekinah glory that filled the tabernacle and temple in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). The divine illumination signifies God's direct and unmediated presence with His people, fulfilling the promise of God dwelling among His people (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>). This light is pure, holy, and eternal, contrasting with the temporary and imperfect light of the sun and moon.<p><b>and the Lamb is its lamp</b><br>The Lamb, a title for Jesus Christ, emphasizes His role in redemption and His sacrificial death. As the lamp, the Lamb is the means through which God's glory is manifested and perceived. This imagery connects to <a href="/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, where Jesus is described as the light of men, and <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, where He declares Himself the light of the world. The Lamb being the lamp highlights the centrality of Christ in the new creation, where His presence is the source of life and truth. This also fulfills the typology of the Passover lamb, pointing to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and source of spiritual illumination.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the New Jerusalem, the holy city described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, symbolizing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_god.htm">The Glory of God</a></b><br>Represents the divine presence and majesty of God, which illuminates the city, eliminating the need for natural light sources like the sun or moon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who is depicted as the sacrificial Lamb, providing spiritual illumination and guidance to the city.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_supremacy_of_god's_glory.htm">The Supremacy of God's Glory</a></b><br>God's presence is the ultimate source of light and life, surpassing all created things.

Light is the emblem of knowledge and holiness.

Christ the Lamb, came as the Light of the World. Now in the heavenly Jerusalem is the light seen as a lamp that burneth. The imagery is drawn from Isaiah. "The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory" (<a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm" title="The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you: but the LORD shall be to you an everlasting light, and your God your glory.">Isaiah 60:19</a>). No more will there be needed subsidiary or intermediate luminaries. He who makes the righteous to shine like stars, and causes His churches to shine like lights in the world, will be Himself the Light and Sun of His people: they shall see Him as He is. It is again to be noticed that the emblem of the Lamb is used to describe our Lord in this verse, and in the last, as it was also in <a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>. The memory of Christ's work on earth is never obliterated: still in the intense splendour and joy of that city of light the remembrance of Him who was led as a lamb to the slaughter gives depth and fulness to its joy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it;</span> <span class="accented">hath no need.</span> So <a href="/isaiah/60-19.htm">Isaiah 60:19, 20</a>, "The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting Light, and thy God thy Glory." <span class="cmt_word">For the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</span> <span class="accented">The glory of God</span> (cf. ver. 11).
