The concept of a "kingdom" reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>, where Israel is called to be a "kingdom of priests." This kingdom is not defined by geographical boundaries but by the spiritual reign of Christ in the hearts of believers. It signifies the establishment of God's rule through the church, which is often referred to as the body of Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>). The kingdom is both a present reality and a future hope, as believers await the full manifestation of God's reign.<p><b>priests to His God and Father</b><br>The role of priests in the Old Testament was to mediate between God and the people, offering sacrifices and prayers. By calling believers "priests," this phrase emphasizes the direct access to God granted through Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>). This priesthood is a spiritual service, involving worship, prayer, and the proclamation of the Gospel. It reflects the democratization of the priestly role, no longer limited to a specific tribe or lineage, but extended to all who are in Christ. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, which describes believers as a "royal priesthood."<p><b>to Him be the glory and power forever and ever!</b><br>This doxology attributes eternal glory and power to God, acknowledging His supreme authority and majesty. The phrase echoes the worship found throughout Revelation, where God's sovereignty is a central theme (<a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; 5:13). The eternal nature of God's glory and power underscores His unchanging character and the everlasting nature of His kingdom. This expression of praise is a response to God's redemptive work through Christ, highlighting the ultimate purpose of creation and redemption: the glorification of God.<p><b>Amen</b><br>"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," used to affirm the truth and certainty of what has been stated. It is a common conclusion to prayers and doxologies, signifying agreement and trust in God's promises. In the context of Revelation, it serves as a seal of affirmation to the preceding declaration of God's glory and power, inviting readers to join in the worship and acknowledgment of God's eternal reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The one who has made believers into a kingdom and priests, central to the message of Revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The recipient of the glory and power mentioned in the verse, highlighting the relationship between Jesus and the Father.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/believers.htm">Believers</a></b><br>Referred to as a "kingdom" and "priests," indicating their role and identity in Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/patmos.htm">Patmos</a></b><br>The island where John received the revelation, a place of exile and divine encounter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Believers are made into a kingdom and priests, signifying a new identity and purpose in Christ.

By His blood He &#8220;released us from our sins&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>), so this new identity is a settled fact, not a future hope.

"Kingdom," not "kings," is the right reading. Christians are nowhere said to be kings. Collectively they are a kingdom - "a kingdom of priests" (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), or, as St. Peter, following the LXX., gives it, "a royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Each member of Christ shares in his eternal priesthood. <span class="cmt_word">Unto God and his Father</span>; more probably we should render, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">unto his God and Father</span> (comp. <a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>). Alford objects that when St. John wishes a possessive genitive to apply to more than one substantive, he commonly repeats the genitive; and he quotes <a href="/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="/john/6-11.htm">John 6:11</a>; <a href="/john/9-21.htm">John 9:21</a>. But in these passages he repeats not only the genitive, but the article. Here the article is not repeated, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> must be taken as one phrase. <span class="cmt_word">To him be the glory</span>. The construction returns to that of the opening clause, "Unto him that loveth us." St. John's doxologies increase in volume as he progresses - twofold here, threefold in <a href="/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, fourfold in <a href="/revelation/5-13.htm">Revelation 5:13</a>, sevenfold in <a href="/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>. In each case all the substantives have the article - "<span class="accented">the</span> glory," "the honour," "<span class="accented">the</span> power," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Forever and ever</span>; literally, <span class="accented">unto the ages of the ages</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">in saecula saeculorum</span>). It occurs twelve times in the Apocalypse, besides once without the articles (<a href="/revelation/14-12.htm">Revelation 14:12</a>). In his Gospel and Epistles St. John uses the simpler formula, "forever," literally, "unto the age" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>).
