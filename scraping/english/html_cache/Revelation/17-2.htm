In biblical symbolism, "immorality" often represents idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The "kings of the earth" suggests a global influence, indicating that this immorality is widespread and not limited to a single nation or region. Historically, this can be seen as a critique of political systems that align themselves with corrupt religious practices or ideologies, reminiscent of Old Testament prophecies against nations like Babylon and Tyre (Isaiah 23, <a href="/jeremiah/50.htm">Jeremiah 50-51</a>). The imagery of immorality also connects to the Old Testament prophets who often described Israel's unfaithfulness to God in terms of adultery (Hosea 1-3, <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>).<p><b>and those who dwell on the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the pervasive influence of the corrupt system on the general populace. "Those who dwell on the earth" is a phrase used in Revelation to describe people who are opposed to God and His ways (<a href="/revelation/3-10.htm">Revelation 3:10, 6</a>:10). The metaphor of being "intoxicated" suggests a loss of moral and spiritual discernment, indicating that the people are not just passively complicit but actively participating in the corruption. The "wine of her immorality" symbolizes the seductive and deceptive nature of the false religious and political systems, drawing a parallel to the Old Testament warnings against being led astray by foreign gods and practices (<a href="/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>). This imagery also serves as a warning to believers to remain vigilant and not be swayed by the prevailing cultural and spiritual deceptions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings_of_the_earth.htm">The Kings of the Earth</a></b><br>These are the rulers and leaders of various nations who have engaged in immoral acts with the symbolic figure described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17</a>.

Revelation often unites them in opposition to the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>; 19:19).<p>- <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> says, &#8220;The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221; That same rebellious spirit appears here.<p>- These rulers are not neutral; they knowingly align with the harlot&#8212;Babylon, the end-times world system that exalts self and wealth over God (<a href="/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3, 9</a>).<p>- By stressing &#8220;kings,&#8221; the verse underlines that no amount of rank or influence immunizes a person from spiritual seduction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were immoral with her</b><p>- The phrase points to deliberate, ongoing participation&#8212;spiritual adultery against the true God (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p>- Immorality is both literal and figurative: literal sexual perversion often accompanies false worship (<a href="/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>), yet the chief issue is covenant unfaithfulness.<p>- <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a> laments, &#8220;How the faithful city has become a harlot!&#8221; The imagery remains consistent: turning from God for profit and pleasure is harlotry.<p>- These kings profit from Babylon&#8217;s commerce and idolatry, just as ancient rulers profited from alliances with pagan nations (<a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and those who dwell on the earth</b><p>- This Revelation phrase (6:10; 13:8, 14) marks people whose hopes, loyalties, and citizenship are fixed here, not in heaven (<a href="/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-20</a>).<p>- They follow their leaders into the same rebellion, confirming a heart-level unity with Babylon&#8217;s agenda.<p>- <a href="/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a> notes that people not only practice evil but &#8220;approve of those who practice it.&#8221; Earth-dwellers applaud the kings&#8217; choices and mirror them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality</b><p>- Immorality functions like strong drink&#8212;stimulating at first, then enslaving (<a href="/proverbs/23-31.htm">Proverbs 23:31-32</a>).<p>- The wine image emphasizes deception: once drunk, clear judgment disappears. Babylon drugs the world with dazzling prosperity, entertainment, and religious pluralism (<a href="/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>).<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a> foreshadows this: &#8220;Babylon was a golden cup in the hand of the LORD, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have gone mad.&#8221;<p>- Intoxication also hints at coming wrath. The same cup that Babylon passes around becomes, for her, the cup of God&#8217;s fury (<a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8-10</a>; 16:19).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/17-2.htm">Revelation 17:2</a> unveils a global coalition&#8212;political leaders and everyday people&#8212;seduced into spiritual adultery by the end-times Babylon system. Kings leverage power for profit, the populace gladly follows, and both become drunk on sin&#8217;s temporary thrill. The verse warns that moral compromise with the world&#8217;s godless structures is never harmless; it intoxicates, enslaves, and ultimately invites God&#8217;s righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</span> "Of the earth" is used here (as it frequently is) for the worldly as distinguished from the righteous; and the two classes mentioned indicate the universality of this faithlessness - it is not confined to any one grade of society. As we have seen (see on ver. 1 and <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>), the figure of <span class="accented">fornication</span> is repeatedly used to describe faithlessness towards God. The verse, therefore, declares that this faithless portion of the Church has chosen rather to render to the world that love which is due to God, and to be connected rather with the powers of this world than to have its treasure in heaven. The expression, "wine of her fornication," is a repetition of that in <a href="/revelation/14-8.htm">Revelation 14:8</a>, and is derived from <a href="/jeremiah/2-7.htm">Jeremiah 2:7</a> (cf. also <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a> and Revelation 18:3). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
