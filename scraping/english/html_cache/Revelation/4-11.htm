The use of "worthy" reflects the recognition of God's inherent value and authority. The title "our Lord and God" emphasizes a personal relationship with the divine, echoing the language of reverence found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/95-3.htm">Psalm 95:3</a>, which declares the Lord as a great God and King above all gods. This phrase also counters the Roman imperial cult of the time, which demanded worship of the emperor as a deity, affirming instead the exclusive divinity of the Christian God.<p><b>to receive glory and honor and power</b><br>The triad of "glory, honor, and power" signifies the totality of worship and reverence due to God. Glory refers to the divine radiance and majesty, honor to the respect and reverence owed, and power to the omnipotence of God. This echoes the heavenly worship scenes in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, where celestial beings ascribe similar attributes to God. The repetition of these terms throughout Revelation underscores the centrality of worship in the heavenly realm and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over all creation.<p><b>for You created all things</b><br>This phrase affirms God as the Creator, a foundational belief in Christian theology. It reflects <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God is depicted as the originator of the universe. The act of creation establishes God's authority and right to receive worship. In the context of Revelation, this serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over history and the cosmos, providing assurance to believers facing persecution. The acknowledgment of God as Creator also contrasts with pagan creation myths, asserting the uniqueness and supremacy of the biblical God.<p><b>by Your will they exist and were created</b><br>This emphasizes the intentionality and purpose behind creation. Everything exists by God's will, highlighting divine sovereignty and the purposeful nature of creation. This aligns with <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, which states that all things were created through and for Christ, indicating that creation is not random but part of a divine plan. The phrase reassures believers of God's ongoing involvement in the world, affirming that nothing exists outside of His will. It also points to the sustaining power of God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where Christ upholds the universe by His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_and_god.htm">The Lord and God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, recognized as the Creator and Sustainer of all things.

They represent the redeemed of all ages, offering praise to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_throne_room_of_heaven.htm">The Throne Room of Heaven</a></b><br>The setting of this verse, where John witnesses the worship of God.
