In biblical context, white garments are frequently mentioned as a sign of holiness and divine approval (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 7</a>:9). The giving of the robe indicates that these souls have been justified and are honored in the presence of God. This imagery connects to the transfiguration of Jesus, where His garments became dazzling white (<a href="/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>), symbolizing His divine nature and glory.<p><b>and told to rest a little while longer</b><br>This phrase suggests a period of waiting and patience. The souls under the altar are martyrs who have been slain for their testimony and faithfulness to God. The call to rest implies that their work on earth is complete, and they are to await God's timing for the fulfillment of His plans. This echoes the biblical theme of God's perfect timing and the call for believers to trust in His sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>, <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>).<p><b>until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers,</b><br>The "full number" indicates a predetermined plan and purpose in God's divine will. It suggests that God has a specific number of martyrs in mind, reflecting His omniscience and the unfolding of His redemptive plan. The mention of "fellow servants" and "brothers" emphasizes the unity and shared mission among believers, highlighting the communal aspect of the Christian faith (<a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29-30</a>).<p><b>were killed, just as they had been killed.</b><br>This phrase underscores the reality of persecution and martyrdom in the Christian experience. It reflects the historical context of the early church, where believers faced severe persecution for their faith (<a href="/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54-60</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). The repetition of martyrdom serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the call to remain faithful unto death (<a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). It also points to the ultimate victory and vindication that awaits those who suffer for Christ's sake, as seen in the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus Himself (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/martyrs.htm">Martyrs</a></b><br>These are the souls of those who have been slain for their testimony and faith in Christ.

It is a reward and a sign of honor given to the martyrs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>In the context of Revelation, the altar represents a place of sacrifice and worship.

They are robes of righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>); they are robes of honour (<a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>), for those who wear them are like God, seeing Him as He is, reflecting His image; they are acknowledged to be His, as they have acknowledged Him to be their God. Persecuted on earth, they are honoured in heaven. There is also a sense in which a white robe is given to them in the eyes of men: those whose names have been cast out as evil have been honoured by a repentant posterity with the robe of tardy praise; after-generations garnish the sepulchres of the righteous whom their fathers slew. The excommunicated in one age are often the canonised of the next, for the dull world learns slowly, and its purest honours are posthumous. But however this may be, for the suffering saints there is the heavenly robe and the heavenly rest.<p><span class= "bld">It was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow- servants also and their brethren, that should be killed </span>(better, <span class= "ital">who are to be slain)</span> <span class= "bld">as they were, should be fulfilled </span>(or, <span class= "ital">shall have fulfilled their course).</span>--They are to "rest." This does not mean that they are to cease their cry for vengeance, for the saints have never cried for this; but they are to rest, as the souls of the faithful after they are delivered from the burden of the flesh, in joy and felicity. But this rest is yet a waiting for a little while till fellow-servants and fellow-sufferers have achieved their work also. To every disciple a work is given in service and suffering, and till these have borne their witness and fulfilled their course (comp. <a href="/context/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7-8</a>, and <a href="/acts/13-25.htm" title="And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think you that I am?

And it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season. <a href="/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. seems to determine the exact signification <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, viz.

The time of the world is <span class="accented">little</span> in comparison with eternity. This <span class="accented">little time</span> is depicted and set forth under the six seals; it comes to an end at <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>, and merges into eternity in <a href="/revelation/8-1.htm">Revelation 8:1</a>. Some expositors (of the historical school) understand a <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be a definite, arbitrary number; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bengel considers it to be 1111 1/9 years (see 'Speaker's Commentary,' p. 485). <span class="cmt_word">Until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</span> R, B, P, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "shall have fulfilled" [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> their course]; A, C, read <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "should be completed." "Their fellow servants also and their brethren" may not denote two separate bodies, notwithstanding that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> occurs twice, but, as Alford remarks, it may point out the same persons viewed in two aspects - first, the Christians needed to proceed with and finish Christ's work as his servants; second, the same ones needed to complete the number of his family. But it seems more likely that reference is intended to two classes of Christians - first, <span class="accented">their fellow servants</span>, that is, all Christians, who may, however, not suffer martyrdom; and, second, <span class="accented">their brethren</span>, the martyrs, who, like them, should yet be killed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">each</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7953;&#954;&#940;&#963;&#964;&#8179;</span> <span class="translit">(hekast&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1538.htm">Strong's 1538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Each (of more than two), every one.
