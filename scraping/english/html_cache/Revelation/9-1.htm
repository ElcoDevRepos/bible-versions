The trumpet judgments are a series of divine interventions that follow the seal judgments, indicating an escalation in the severity of God's wrath. The number five often symbolizes grace in biblical numerology, but here it introduces a period of intense spiritual and physical torment. The role of angels as messengers and executors of God's will is consistent throughout Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a> and <a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>.<p><b>and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth</b><br>The "star" is often interpreted as a symbolic representation of a being, likely an angelic or spiritual entity. The past tense "had fallen" suggests a previous event, possibly alluding to the fall of Satan as described in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> and <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>. Stars are frequently used in biblical literature to symbolize angels or celestial beings, as seen in <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> and <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>. The fall from heaven to earth indicates a transition from a position of authority or purity to one of judgment or rebellion.<p><b>and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss</b><br>The "key" signifies authority and control, suggesting that this fallen star is granted permission by God to unlock the Abyss. The Abyss, or bottomless pit, is a place of confinement for demonic forces, referenced in <a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> and <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>. The granting of the key indicates that even in judgment, God maintains sovereign control over the forces of evil. The imagery of keys is also seen in <a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, where Christ holds the keys of death and Hades, underscoring His ultimate authority over life and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fifth_angel.htm">Fifth Angel</a></b><br>This angel is one of the seven angels who sound the trumpets, each heralding a specific judgment or event during the end times.

Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm" title="How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how are you cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!">Isaiah 14:12</a>) speaks of Lucifer fallen from heaven. Christ described Satan as lightning falling from heaven. Some great power or ruler is represented, then, by this fallen star. He is, moreover, said to have fallen from heaven, and he is represented as having been given the key of the abyss. Does not this lead us to expect the working of some evil spirit and diabolical agency? The 11th verse confirms our expectation. We may compare <a href="/context/revelation/12-8.htm" title="And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.">Revelation 12:8-12</a>, where Satan is described as defeated, cast down to the earth, and filled with wrath. To understand this fallen star as the representative of a good angel seems hardly possible.<p><span class= "bld">And to him was given </span>. . .--Literally, <span class= "ital">and there was given to him (i.e.,</span> to the being represented as a fallen star) <span class= "ital">the key of</span> (not "the bottomless pit") <span class= "ital">the pit of the abyss.</span> The abyss is the same word rendered "the deep," in <a href="/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a>, where the demons besought our Lord not to send them into the abyss, or deep. It is the word which describes the abode of the evil spirits. The verse before us suggests the picture of a vast depth approached by a pit or shaft, whose top, or mouth, is covered. Dante's <span class= "ital">Inferno,</span> with its narrowing circles winding down to the central shaft, is somewhat similar. The abyss is the lowest spring of evil, whence the worst dangers arise. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/11-7.htm" title="And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/20-1.htm" title="And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.">Revelation 20:1-3</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth;</span> <span class="accented">a star from heaven fallen unto the earth</span> (Revised Version); not <span class="accented">saw a star fall.</span> (For the distinctive character of the last three judgments, see on Revelation 8:2.) "A star" sometimes signifies one high in position. Thus <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, "There shall come a star out of Jacob;" <a href="/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a>, "And it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground." In <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a> "the stars" are "the angels of the seven Churches;" in <a href="/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a> the angels are called "stars;" in <a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a> we have Satan referred to thus: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!" It seems, therefore, that Satan himself is here referred to under this symbol. The trumpet visions hitherto have portrayed troubles affecting the outer man; now begin to be set forth these yet more terrible visitations which, affecting his spiritual nature, are seen more directly to emanate from the devil. He has fallen "from heaven unto the earth;" that is, whereas formerly heaven was his abode, the sphere of his work while yet obedient to God, he now has no office or power, or entrance there, but is permitted to exercise what influence he possesses on the earth (cf. <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>, "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven"). This is the view of Tertullian, Aretbas, Bede, Vitriuga, Alford, believe an evil angel is meant; Wordsworth thinks an apostate Christian teacher is signified; Andreas, Bengel, and De Wette believe a good angel is intended; others see particular emperors, etc.; while Hengstenberg thinks the figure represents not one, but a number of persons, including Napoleon. <span class="cmt_word">And to him was given the key of the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">of the pit of the abyss</span> (Revised Version). That is, as Wordsworth explains, of the aperture by which there is no egress from or ingress into the abyss. Christ holds the key (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>), but for a season Satan is permitted to exercise power. The <span class="accented">abyss</span> is the abode of the devil and his angels; the present abode, not the lake of fire, into which they are subsequently cast (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
