The "loud voice from heaven" is often associated with God's direct communication, as seen in other biblical instances such as the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>) and the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). The witnesses, identified earlier in <a href="/revelation/11.htm">Revelation 11</a> as the two prophets, symbolize God's messengers who have completed their testimony on earth. The voice from heaven signifies approval and a command for their next phase, reflecting the divine orchestration of events.<p><b>&#8220;Come up here.&#8221;</b><br>This command mirrors the call to John in <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>, where he is invited to witness heavenly visions. It signifies a transition from earthly ministry to heavenly reward, emphasizing the theme of divine vindication and ascension. The phrase suggests a rapture-like event, where the faithful are taken up to be with God, echoing the experiences of Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), who were also taken up to heaven without experiencing death.<p><b>And they went up to heaven in a cloud</b><br>The cloud is a significant biblical symbol of God's presence and glory, as seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) and the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-5.htm">Matthew 17:5</a>). The ascension of the witnesses in a cloud parallels Jesus' ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>), reinforcing their role as Christ-like figures who share in His victory and exaltation. This imagery underscores the divine approval and the fulfillment of their prophetic mission.<p><b>as their enemies watched them.</b><br>The presence of enemies highlights the ongoing conflict between God's people and the forces of evil. The public nature of the ascension serves as a powerful testimony to God's sovereignty and the ultimate triumph of His purposes. It echoes the vindication themes found in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>) and the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>), where God's servants are exalted in the sight of their adversaries.

The scene assures believers that faithful testimony will be honored, evil will be confronted, and God&#8217;s word will be fulfilled exactly as spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And they heard . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And they heard</span> (or, <span class= "ital">I heard;</span> the MS. authority is divided, though the balance inclines to the first) <span class= "ital">a great voice out of the heaven saying to them. Come up hither. And they went up into the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</span> The resurrection of the witnesses is followed by their ascension. It is the token that in this too they shall have a portion with their Lord; rejected and slain, there is welcome and honour for them; they take their place with those who through faith and patience inherit the promises; they rest from their labours. But this is not all. Like Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.">2Kings 2:11</a>), they are taken up gloriously, but not, like Elijah, in comparative secret; their enemies see their exaltation. As for the witnesses themselves there is the welcome rest of heaven, so there is the visible recognition of their work and power on earth; the cause which seemed dead revives, and with its revival comes the recognition of those who laboured for it; the martyred are seen transfigured, they become glorious in the eyes of men:<p>"Persecution dragged them into fame,<p>And chased them up to heaven."<p>They went up in <span class= "ital">the</span> cloud: There is here, perhaps, a touch of recollection. St. John remembers the cloud which received his Lord out of sight. Since then the cloud mingles with his every thought of ascension or descending from heaven. (Comp. <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="/acts/1-9.htm" title="And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.">Acts 1:9</a>.) The witnesses, like their Master, disappeared in the cloud.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I heard," for <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "they heard," in a correction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and in B, Coptic, Armenian, Andreas, may have arisen from the similarity of the passage to <a href="/revelation/6-6.htm">Revelation 6:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-13.htm">Revelation 9:13</a>. Dusterdieck, who reads, "I heard," points out that in <a href="/revelation/6-11.htm">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, the phrase used in addressing others is, "It was said unto them." Thus the fate of the Church is that of her Lord, and it is the fate of each individual who may witness of God. Suffering, apparent extinction, perhaps, but ultimate triumph and ascension into the presence of God is their common inheritance. If so be that they suffer with him, they are also glorified with him (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). Alford remarks that "no attempt has been made to explain this ascension by those who interpret the witnesses figuratively of the Old and New Testaments, or the like." Is it not the resurrection of the just, of the witnesses of God, and their exaltation at the beginning of the last judgment? Thus St. Paul says, "But each in his own order: Christ the Firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end" (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-13.htm">1 Corinthians 15:13</a>). This "end" is immediately referred to by the seer. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them; <span class="accented">in the cloud.</span> The parallelism with Elijah and Christ (see vers. 5, 6, 8) is carried still further. The Church is triumphantly vindicated and glorified as they were; the only difference is that now all men behold it. <span class="accented">The cloud</span> is not that which hides them from view, but rather, like that in <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, something which exalts and enhances the glory of the witnesses.
