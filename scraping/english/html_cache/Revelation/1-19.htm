The command to "write" underscores the importance of preserving divine revelation for future generations. The phrase "the things you have seen" refers to the visions John has already witnessed, particularly the vision of the glorified Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-12.htm">Revelation 1:12-18</a>. This aligns with the biblical tradition of prophets recording their visions, as seen in Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. The act of writing ensures the transmission of God's message to the seven churches and, by extension, to all believers.<p><b>the things that are</b><br>This phrase pertains to the current state of the seven churches in Asia Minor, to whom the book of Revelation is addressed. These churches are Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, each facing unique challenges and spiritual conditions. The letters to these churches in Revelation chapters 2 and 3 provide insight into the spiritual health and struggles of early Christian communities. This section serves as both a historical account and a timeless message for the Church, emphasizing the need for faithfulness, repentance, and perseverance.<p><b>and the things that will happen after this</b><br>This phrase introduces the prophetic aspect of Revelation, focusing on future events that will unfold according to God's sovereign plan. It encompasses the apocalyptic visions from <a href="/revelation/4.htm">Revelation 4</a> onward, detailing the end times, the final judgment, and the ultimate victory of Christ. This forward-looking perspective is consistent with biblical prophecy, which often includes both immediate and eschatological fulfillment. The phrase highlights the continuity of God's redemptive work from the present into the future, offering hope and assurance to believers. It also connects to other prophetic scriptures, such as Daniel and Zechariah, which similarly anticipate the culmination of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who received the vision while exiled on the island of Patmos.

This vision is to be described for the benefit of the Church of Christ, that she may never forget Him who is the foundation on which she rests; the true fountain of her life; and in whom she will find the source of that renewing power to which the last Note alludes.
