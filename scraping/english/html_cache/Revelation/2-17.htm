It echoes Jesus' teachings in the Gospels, where He often used similar language to emphasize the importance of understanding His message (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>, <a href="/mark/4-9.htm">Mark 4:9</a>). The "Spirit" refers to the Holy Spirit, who communicates divine truth to the believers. The plural "churches" indicates that the message is not just for the specific church addressed but for all congregations, suggesting a universal application of the teachings and warnings in Revelation.<p><b>To the one who overcomes,</b><br>The concept of overcoming is central to the messages to the seven churches in Revelation. It implies a spiritual victory over sin, temptation, and the trials of life. This overcoming is often linked to faithfulness and perseverance in the face of persecution or false teachings. The term "overcomes" is also connected to the promises given to believers who remain steadfast, as seen in other parts of Revelation (e.g., <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 3</a>:12, 3:21).<p><b>I will give the hidden manna.</b><br>The "hidden manna" symbolizes spiritual sustenance and divine provision. In the Old Testament, manna was the miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-15</a>). Here, it represents the spiritual nourishment and eternal life given by Christ to those who are faithful. The "hidden" aspect may suggest the mysterious and spiritual nature of this provision, unseen by the world but revealed to believers.<p><b>I will also give him a white stone</b><br>In ancient times, a white stone could symbolize acquittal or acceptance, as in the case of a juror's vote for innocence. It might also represent a token of victory or a symbol of honor. The white stone here signifies purity, victory, and the believer's acceptance by God. It contrasts with the black stones used for condemnation, highlighting the believer's justified status before God.<p><b>inscribed with a new name,</b><br>The "new name" signifies a transformed identity and a personal relationship with God. In biblical tradition, a new name often marks a significant change or calling, as seen with Abram becoming Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) or Jacob becoming Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This new name reflects the believer's new life in Christ and their unique identity in the kingdom of God.<p><b>known only to the one who receives it.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and intimate nature of the relationship between the believer and God. The exclusivity of the knowledge of the new name suggests a special bond and a unique identity that each believer has in Christ. It highlights the personal nature of salvation and the individual attention God gives to each of His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_overcomer.htm">The Overcomer</a></b><br>Refers to believers who remain faithful and victorious in their spiritual journey, overcoming trials and temptations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit.htm">The Spirit</a></b><br>The Holy Spirit, who communicates God's message to the churches.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_churches.htm">The Churches</a></b><br>Specifically, the church in Pergamum, but by extension, all Christian churches receiving the message of Revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hidden_manna.htm">Hidden Manna</a></b><br>Symbolizes spiritual sustenance and the provision of God, reminiscent of the manna given to the Israelites in the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/white_stone.htm">White Stone</a></b><br>Represents purity, acceptance, and a personal relationship with Christ, possibly linked to ancient customs of using stones for voting or as tokens of admission.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_name.htm">New Name</a></b><br>Signifies a new identity in Christ, known only to the recipient, indicating a personal and intimate relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_discernment.htm">Spiritual Discernment</a></b><br>"He who has an ear, let him hear" emphasizes the need for spiritual awareness and attentiveness to the Holy Spirit's guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_in_christ.htm">Victory in Christ</a></b><br>The promise to the overcomer encourages believers to persevere in faith, trusting in Christ's victory over sin and the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_provision.htm">Divine Provision</a></b><br>The hidden manna symbolizes God's ongoing provision and sustenance for those who trust in Him, encouraging reliance on spiritual nourishment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_relationship_with_god.htm">Personal Relationship with God</a></b><br>The white stone and new name highlight the unique and personal relationship each believer has with Christ, encouraging intimacy with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>The new name signifies a transformed identity, reminding believers of their new life and purpose in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_2_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_does_hidden_manna_symbolize.htm">What does the "hidden manna" symbolize for believers in Revelation 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_overcome_in_Revelation_2_17.htm">How can we seek to "overcome" as mentioned in Revelation 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_white_stone_biblically.htm">What is the significance of the "white stone" in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Revelation_2_17_to_OT_promises.htm">How does Revelation 2:17 connect to God's promises in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_a_new_name_in_life.htm">How can we apply the promise of a "new name" in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_is_the_hidden_manna_in_Rev_2_17.htm">What is the "hidden manna" mentioned in Revelation 2:17, and what does it symbolize?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/White_stone_s_link_to_ancient_customs.htm">How does the "white stone" in Revelation 2:17 relate to ancient cultural practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_a_new_name_in_Rev_2_17_important.htm">What is the significance of receiving a "new name" in Revelation 2:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_revelation_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Revelation 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_hidden_manna.htm">What is the meaning of Hidden Manna?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_beliefs_be_chosen_freely.htm">What is the meaning of Hidden Manna?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_messages_to_the_7_churches.htm">What messages are given to the seven churches in Revelation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_is_jerusalem's_'new_name'_reconciled.htm">How does the promise of a &#8220;new name&#8221;

That to the <span class= "ital">manna</span> is indeed obvious. Israel ate manna in the wilderness, and died; the Father gives the true bread from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. The Son is that Bread of Life. He that eateth Him, even he shall live by Him (<a href="/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>; <a href="/john/6-48.htm" title="I am that bread of life.">John 6:48</a>; <a href="/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>)--live, even though like Antipas he die; for a man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses, but in the moral qualities which go to make up his character; and spiritual gifts are the food of these moral qualities, and these gifts are through Christ. But the promise is of <span class= "ital">hidden</span> manna. Is the allusion to the pot of manna which had been laid up in the ark? There is no doubt that the Jews long cherished the belief that the ark and sacred treasures of the Temple had not perished. There was a fondly-held tradition that they had been buried by Jeremiah in a safe and secret spot on "the mountain where Moses climbed and saw the heritage of God, until the time that God shall gather His people again together, and show them His mercy" (<a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-4.htm" title="It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.">2 Maccabees 2:4</a>; <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-7.htm" title="Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy.">2 Maccabees 2:7</a>). This "hidden manna," so longed for by an afflicted race, may have suggested the use of the word "hidden"; but the sacred writer would become anxious to bring out the spiritual truth that the fountains of Christian life are hidden (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>), the world knoweth us not. Like the fire in the Interpreter's house, men may try to quench it, but a hidden hand pours in secretly the food of the fuel. More difficult is the meaning of the white stone, graven with the new name. Some see in it an allusion to the Urim and Thummim; and therefore take it to indicate the "priestly dignity of the victorious Christian." In favour of this, it may be noted that it gives unity to the blessing. Manna and the precious stones worn by the high-priest are both wilderness and Jewish illustrations. Against it, however, must be set the fact that the word here rendered "stone" is never so applied, a different word being used both in the LXX. and in this book to denote a precious stone. Another suggestion, which is, perhaps, less encumbered with difficulty, is that the reference is to the stone or pebble of friendship, called <span class= "ital">tessera hospitalis, </span>graven with some legend or device; and which gave to its possessor a claim of hospitality from him who gave it. Some such tickets admitted those invited into the heathen temples on festival days, when the meat which had been offered as a sacrifice formed part of the feast. The stone is called <span class= "ital">white;</span> but the word does not imply that it is a stone of white colour, but that it is shining, glistering white. On the stone is graven a new name. The giving of new names is not uncommon in the Bible: for example, Abraham, Israel, Boanerges, Peter. The new name expressed the step which had been taken into a higher, truer life, and the change of heart and the elevation of character consequent upon it. Such are known in the world by their daily life, their business, their character; they are known above by the place they hold, and the work (the real character of which is quite unknown to the world) they are doing in the great war against evil. No man knoweth the characteristics of the growth of the character, the spiritual conflict in which the work is done, and the features of that change which has been, and is being wrought, except he who experiences the love, the grace, and the tribulation by which his spirit-life has grown. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear</span> (see notes on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">To him that overcometh</span>. Again it is made clear that the individual can free himself from the corruption and condemnation of his Church. He may live in the very abode of Satan, and within hearing of damnable doctrines; yet if he overcomes the wiles of Satan, and listens to the Spirit rather than to the seducers, "he shall eat of the hidden manna which restores the spirit that the flesh pots of Egypt have weakened. He shall have the white stone of absolution, the true spiritual emancipation, which the Balaamite and Nicolaitan emancipation has counterfeited" (F.D. Maurice). "The manna, the hidden manna" (see notes on ver. 13), is differently explained: by the repetition of the article, the epithet "hidden" is made very distinct. There is probably some allusion to the manna stored up in the ark in the holy of holies (<a href="/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>), and also to the true Bread from heaven, whose presence is now hidden from us; or the reference may be to the loss of the ark, with its contents, when Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem (2 Esdr. 10:22). There was a tradition that Jeremiah had hidden the manna, and that it would be brought to light again in the Messianic kingdom. A share in those things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, and to the heart of man never occurred (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>), will be granted to the conqueror - a foretaste of them here, and a full participation hereafter (comp. <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a> and <a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). "To eat" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) is an insertion into the true text borrowed from ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">a new name written</span>. "White" and "new," as Trench points out, are keywords in the Apocalypse; and it is natural that they should be so. White is "the livery of heaven," where white robes, white clouds, white horses, and white thrones abound (<a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>; <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 13</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11, 14</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>). And "new" is almost as frequent as "white" in the book which tells of a new heaven and a new earth, in which is the new Jerusalem; where the inhabitants have a new name, and sing a new song, and where all things are made new (<a href="/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-3.htm">Revelation 14:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1, 2, 5</a>). But in spite of the familiarity and appropriateness of the two epithets, "white" and "new," a sure interpretation of the white stone with the new name upon it cannot be found. Trench's dictum, that "this book moves exclusively within the circle of sacred, that is, of Jewish imagery and symbols," and that an allusion to heathen or profane customs is inadmissible, is arbitrary and cannot be proved. As already shown, there may be references to the rites of Dionysus, to the games, and to the crown placed on the corpse of a victor. Here there may be an allusion to the white pebble of acquittal used in courts of justice, or to the lot used in elections; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> favours these views. Or again, the reference may be to the <span class="accented">tossers</span>, or ticket, which the victor in the games received to admit him to the tables where he was fed at the public expense. Among Jewish symbols a reference to the "stone with seven eyes" (<a href="/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>) seems to be quite out of place. Nevertheless, Trench's explanation of the "white stone" as an allusion to the Urim and Thummim, which the high priest wore behind the square breastplate of judgment has much that is very attractive. This precious thing may well have been a diamond, for there was no diamond among the twelve stones of the breastplate. On each of these stones was written the name of a tribe; but what was written on the Urim none but the high priest knew. The usual supposition is that it was the sacred Tetragrammaton - the ineffable name of God. All this seems to fit in singularly well with the present passage. But if this explanation is to hold, <span class="accented">"he</span> that receiveth it" must mean he that receiveth the white stone, rather than he that receiveth the new name. The "new name" is not a fresh name for himself (<a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>), but a fresh revelation of God's Name and nature, which only those who have received it can comprehend (comp. <a href="/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). A variety of other explanations will be found in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Stones," in Alford, and elsewhere. Whatever the allusion maybe, the general sense is clear. He that overcometh shall be admitted to the heavenly holy of holies, and to a glory and knowledge incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>). He shall be made a priest unto God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/2-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
