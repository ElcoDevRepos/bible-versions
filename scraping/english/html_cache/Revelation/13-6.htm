Blasphemy against God indicates a direct challenge to divine authority, reminiscent of <a href="/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>, where a similar figure speaks against the Most High. This act of blasphemy is a hallmark of rebellion against God, echoing Satan's original rebellion. Historically, blasphemy was a serious offense in Jewish law, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>), highlighting the severity of the beast's actions.<p><b>and to slander His name</b><br>Slandering God's name involves misrepresenting His character and attributes. In biblical times, a name was more than a label; it represented one's essence and reputation. The beast's slander is an attempt to undermine God's holiness and authority, similar to the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This act is a direct violation of the Third Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>), which forbids taking the Lord's name in vain.<p><b>and His tabernacle</b><br>The tabernacle, originally the portable dwelling place of God among the Israelites, symbolizes God's presence with His people. In the New Testament, the concept of the tabernacle extends to the church and the body of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The beast's slander against the tabernacle signifies an attack on the community of faith and God's dwelling among them. This mirrors the historical desecration of holy places by pagan rulers, such as Antiochus IV Epiphanes' actions in the Second Temple.<p><b>those who dwell in heaven</b><br>This phrase refers to the heavenly host, including angels and the redeemed saints. The beast's slander extends beyond earthly realms, challenging the authority and purity of those in heaven. This reflects the cosmic scope of the spiritual battle described in Revelation, where the forces of evil oppose not only God's earthly followers but also His heavenly kingdom. The phrase underscores the ultimate victory of those who dwell in heaven, as they are beyond the beast's reach, aligning with the assurance found in passages like <a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, which speaks of believers' citizenship in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of a powerful, evil entity or system that opposes God and His people.

God is depicted as sovereign and holy, deserving of all worship and honor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's dwelling place among His people.
