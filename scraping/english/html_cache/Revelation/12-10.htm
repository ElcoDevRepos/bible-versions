The "loud voice" signifies urgency and the need for attention. In biblical context, heavenly voices often announce significant events or divine interventions, as seen in other apocalyptic literature.<p><b>Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ.</b><br>This declaration marks a pivotal moment in the cosmic battle between good and evil. "Salvation" refers to the deliverance of God's people, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. "Power" and "kingdom" highlight God's sovereign rule being fully realized. The "authority of His Christ" underscores Jesus' messianic role and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in Isaiah and Daniel, where the Messiah is depicted as a ruling king.<p><b>For the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down&#8212;</b><br>The "accuser" is identified as Satan, whose role as the adversary is well-documented in Job and Zechariah. His being "thrown down" signifies a decisive defeat, echoing Jesus' words in <a href="/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a> about seeing Satan fall like lightning. This event is a turning point in the spiritual realm, indicating a shift in the balance of power.<p><b>he who accuses them day and night before our God.</b><br>This phrase highlights Satan's relentless nature in his accusations against believers, reminiscent of his actions in the book of Job. The continuous "day and night" underscores the persistent spiritual warfare faced by Christians. However, the context of Revelation assures believers of ultimate victory through Christ, who intercedes on their behalf, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a> and <a

The words of this doxology are like an echo of the close of the Lord's Prayer. The prayer "Thy kingdom come" seems answered. Now is come the kingdom. But it is not the full establishment of the kingdom which is here described; it is rather the manifestation of it. Since our Master passed into the heavens--and His victory is achieved, we know Him to be <span class= "ital">King, </span>and even while we pray "Thy kingdom come" we yet confess "Thine is the kingdom"--the salvation so anxiously looked for (<a href="/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:">1Peter 1:10</a>); the power so much needed by weak and sinful men (<a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1Peter 1:5</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>); and the kingdom which cannot be shaken (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm" title="Why we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:">Hebrews 12:28</a>). The accuser of the brethren is cast down. This is another reason for joy and another feature of the salvation. The habit of the accuser is expressed by the use of the present tense. We should read not "who accused," but "who <span class= "ital">accuseth."</span> Night and day he accused. (Comp. <a href="/zechariah/3-1.htm" title="And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.">Zechariah 3:1</a>, and <a href="/job/1-9.htm" title="Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?">Job 1:9</a>; <a href="/job/2-5.htm" title="But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.">Job 2:5</a>.) In Jewish writings, Michael is called "the advocate" (<span class= "ital">sunegor</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and stands in opposition to the accuser (<span class= "ital">kategor</span>); but now the accuser is cast down; for who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect, when it is God that justifieth, when it is Christ that died? (<a href="/context/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies.">Romans 8:33-34</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven.</span> The "great voice" is characteristic of all the heavenly utterances (cf. <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-1.htm">Revelation 6:1, 10</a>; <a href="/revelation/16-17.htm">Revelation 16:17</a>, etc.). The personality of the speaker is not indicated. From the following chorus the <span class="accented">voice</span> would seem to proceed from many inhabitants of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ;</span> <span class="accented">the salvation and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ</span> (Revised Version). The Revised Version marginal reading may also be noticed, <span class="accented">Now is the salvation</span>... <span class="accented">become our God's, and the authority</span> [<span class="accented">is become</span>] <span class="accented">his Christ's.</span> The heavenly inhabitants celebrate the triumphant confirmation of God's supremacy, which has been vindicated by the defeat and expulsion of the rebellious hosts. "The salvation of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is that which proceeds from him; "that salvation which belongs to God as its Author" (Alford); cf. <a href="/revelation/7-10.htm">Revelation 7:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-1.htm">Revelation 19:1</a>. "The authority of his Christ" is first manifested in heaven; Satan is cast down to the earth, and here again at a subsequent epoch the <span class="accented">authority of Christ</span> is displayed, and another victory won over the devil. This seems to be the conclusion of the heavenly song. As before stated (see on ver. 7), the three and a half verses now concluded seem to relate to a period previous to the creation of the world. It seems equally probable that the following two and a half verses refer to those earthly martyrs and suffering Christians for whom this book is specially written. These two views can be reconciled by supposing the song of the heavenly <span class="accented">voice</span> to cease at the word "Christ" (ver. 10); and then the writer adds words of his own, as if he would say, "The cause of the victorious song which I have just recited was the fact that the devil was cast down, the same who is constantly accusing (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) our brethren. But they (our brethren) overcame him, and valued not their lives, etc. Well may ye heavens rejoice over your happy lot, though it means woe to the earth for a short time." <span class="cmt_word">For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</span> <span class="accented">The one accusing them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); not the past tense. Satan does not cease to accuse, though he may not do so with effect, since he may be overcome by the "blood of the Lamb." The heavenly beings are henceforth beyond his reach. He can yet accuse men - our brethren - says St. John; but even here his power is limited by the victory of the death and resurrection of Christ referred to in ver. 5. "Accuser" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, C, P, Andreas, Arethas. The form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, found in A, is rather the Targumic and rabbinic corruption of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d8;&#x5d9;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, than the Greek word itself. "Of our brethren," the saints and martyrs (see above); "is cast down" (or, "was cast down") from heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(&#275;kousa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
