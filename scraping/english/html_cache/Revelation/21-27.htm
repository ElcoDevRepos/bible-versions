In biblical context, "unclean" refers to anything that is morally or ritually impure. The concept of purity is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where the Israelites were given laws to distinguish between clean and unclean (Leviticus 11). The New Jerusalem is depicted as a place where sin and impurity have no place, reflecting the holiness of God Himself (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>). This aligns with the vision of a new heaven and a new earth where righteousness dwells (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>).<p><b>nor anyone who practices an abomination or a lie</b><br>The term "abomination" is often used in Scripture to describe actions that are detestable to God, such as idolatry and moral corruption (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>). Lies and deceit are also condemned throughout the Bible (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>). This phrase underscores the exclusion of those who persist in sin and rebellion against God from the holy city. It reflects the final judgment where those who have not repented and turned to God are separated from His presence (<a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41-46</a>).<p><b>but only those whose names are written in the Lamb&#8217;s Book of Life</b><br>The "Lamb's Book of Life" is a symbolic register of those who have received eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>). This concept is rooted in the idea of divine records, as seen in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>, <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). The Lamb, representing Jesus, signifies His sacrificial death and victory over sin and death (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6-9</a>). Only those who have accepted Christ's atonement and have been transformed by His grace are granted access to the New Jerusalem. This phrase highlights the exclusivity of salvation through Christ alone (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>) and the assurance of eternal life for believers (1 <a href="/john/5-11.htm">John 5:11-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_jerusalem.htm">The New Jerusalem</a></b><br>This is the holy city described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, representing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people.

The allusion is to the care of the Jews to exclude all things unclean from the precincts of the sanctuary.
