The loud voice signifies the importance and universality of the message, ensuring that it is heard by all. In biblical context, angels often serve as messengers of God, delivering divine revelations or warnings (e.g., <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>).<p><b>Fear God and give Him glory</b><br>To "fear God" means to have reverence and awe for the Almighty, recognizing His power and authority. This call to fear and glorify God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>, <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Giving God glory involves acknowledging His majesty and sovereignty, often through worship and obedience. This phrase emphasizes the need for humanity to recognize God's rightful place as Creator and Judge.<p><b>because the hour of His judgment has come</b><br>This indicates the imminence of God's judgment, a central theme in Revelation. The "hour" suggests a specific, appointed time, aligning with prophetic timelines found in Daniel and other apocalyptic literature. The concept of divine judgment is rooted in the Old Testament, where God judges nations and individuals (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>). In the New Testament, this judgment is often associated with the return of Christ and the final reckoning (e.g., <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>).<p><b>Worship the One who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters</b><br>This phrase calls for worship of God as the Creator, echoing the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. It underscores God's sovereignty over all creation, contrasting with pagan worship of created things (e.g., <a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>). The mention of "heavens and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters" highlights the totality of God's creative work, reminding believers of His power and authority over all aspects of the natural world. This call to worship is a direct challenge to idolatry and a reminder of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A messenger from God delivering a crucial message to humanity.

The angel commands humanity to:<p>1. Return to a holy fear of God.<p>2. Actively glorify Him.<p>3. Recognize that the moment of judgment is already upon us.<p>4. Bow before the Creator of every part of the universe.<p>The message is simple yet sweeping: honor God now, because the Judge and Creator is here, and His verdict will stand forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Saying . . .</span>--These words declare what ought to be the effect of the gospel. Those to whom it is preached are sitting inactive on the earth. They must be roused to fear God and give Him glory. They must not fear the powers of evil, the wild beasts, &c., or be afraid of their terror (<a href="/context/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1Peter 3:14-15</a>). They must realise that there is an hour of judgment at hand, which will discriminate between the worshippers of the world and of God. Let them learn to worship the Creator of all, and to turn from the worship of lesser and lower.<p>If we ask when this gospel angel appeared, our answer must be that the whole cycle of the gospel preaching is included in the vision, though doubtless there have been ages when the light of the glad tidings of God has gone forth with revived lustre, and when the warnings against easy acquiescence in evil have been given with unmistakable distinctness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying with a loud voice.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "saying," in nominative, though agreeing with the accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>," angel." The "great voice" is characteristic of all the heavenly utterances (ver. 2; <a href="/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12, 15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear God, and give glory to him.</span> Thus the angel proclaims the gospel in opposition to the second beast, who bids those that dwell on the earth to make an image to the first beast (cf. <a href="/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>). Compare the effect of the coming judgment, described in <a href="/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For the hour of his judgment is come</span>. This is the reason given for the <span class="accented">fear</span> mentioned. That it has effect is seen by <a href="/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>. <span class="accented">Is come</span>; that is to say, is at hand. <span class="cmt_word">And worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span> As remarked above, the angel thus directly opposes the invitation of the second beast to pay homage to the first beast. Again we have the fourfold enumeration of objects of creation, denoting the universal nature of the assertion (cf. on ver. 6). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
