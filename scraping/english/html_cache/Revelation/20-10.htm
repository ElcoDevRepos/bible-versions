The deception began in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3) and continues throughout history. Satan's role as the deceiver is highlighted in various scriptures, such as <a href="/2_corinthians/11-14.htm">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>, where he masquerades as an angel of light, and <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, where he is described as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.<p><b>was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur</b><br>The lake of fire is a symbol of final judgment and eternal punishment. It is mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>, where the beast and the false prophet are cast into it. The imagery of fire and sulfur is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), symbolizing complete and utter destruction. This place is also referred to as the second death in <a href="/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>, indicating a final and irreversible state of separation from God.<p><b>into which the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown</b><br>The beast and the false prophet represent the forces of political and religious deception that oppose God. Their prior judgment in <a href="/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a> signifies the defeat of worldly powers and false religions that lead people away from the truth. This act of casting them into the lake of fire demonstrates God's ultimate authority and justice over all creation.<p><b>There they will be tormented day and night</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuous and unending nature of the punishment. The concept of eternal torment is supported by other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>, which speaks of eternal punishment, and <a href="/mark/9-48.htm">Mark 9:48</a>, where the worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of rebellion against God.<p><b>forever and ever</b><br>The repetition of "forever and ever" underscores the eternal nature of the judgment. This phrase is used throughout Revelation to describe the eternal reign of God (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>) and the eternal life promised to believers (<a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). It highlights the contrast between the eternal joy of the redeemed and the eternal punishment of the wicked, affirming the finality and seriousness of God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>The primary antagonist in Christian theology, representing evil and opposition to God.

The judgment of human beings must follow. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever;</span> <span class="accented">and they shall be tormented.</span> The last clause shows that this is the final judgment and punishment of the devil. Thus at this verse is completed the whole series of visions commencing at <a href="/revelation/12.htm">Revelation 12</a>, in which arc set forth the origin and progress of the influence of evil, and the final termination of the conflict between God and his Church on the one hand, and the devil and his adherents on the other. It remains now only to shadow forth the surpassing glory of the saints in their everlasting home, and thus to bring the book to a conclusion. This, therefore, is the theme of the remaining chapters. (On "the devil that deceiveth them," see on ver. 3; and on "the lake of fire and brimstone," see on Revelation 19:20.) <span class="accented">Shall be tormented</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>, "Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/20-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
