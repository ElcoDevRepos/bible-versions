Gold and silver have been historically used as currency and symbols of wealth and power throughout biblical history, as seen in the construction of the Tabernacle and Solomon's Temple (<a href="/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). Precious stones and pearls are often associated with beauty and value, reminiscent of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>) and the New Jerusalem's foundations (<a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19-21</a>). The accumulation of such wealth can be seen as a critique of the idolatry of materialism, contrasting with the spiritual riches found in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>).<p><b>of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet;</b><br>These textiles represent luxury and status. Fine linen was used in the garments of the priests (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>) and signifies purity and righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). Purple dye, derived from the murex shellfish, was extremely costly and reserved for royalty and the wealthy (<a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>; <a href="/mark/15-17.htm">Mark 15:17</a>). Silk, a rare and expensive fabric, and scarlet, a color associated with wealth and sin (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>), further emphasize the decadence of Babylon. The use of these materials underscores the city's pride and self-indulgence, contrasting with the humility and simplicity taught by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>of all kinds of citron wood and every article of ivory, precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;</b><br>Citron wood, known for its fragrance and durability, was used in luxury items and furniture. Ivory, often imported from distant lands, was a symbol of wealth and was used in Solomon's throne (<a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>). Precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble were materials used in the construction of grand buildings and idols, reflecting human achievement and pride. These materials are reminiscent of the opulence of ancient empires like Babylon and Rome, which are often seen as types of worldly power opposed to God's kingdom. The mention of these materials serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly wealth and the ultimate judgment against those who trust in material possessions rather than in God (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon_the_great.htm">Babylon the Great</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, corrupt system or city that is characterized by wealth and luxury, often interpreted as representing worldly materialism and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/merchants_of_the_earth.htm">Merchants of the Earth</a></b><br>These are the traders and business people who profit from the wealth and luxury of Babylon, lamenting its fall due to their loss of income.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fall_of_babylon.htm">The Fall of Babylon</a></b><br>A prophetic event symbolizing the ultimate downfall of worldly systems that oppose God, marked by the destruction of material wealth and luxury.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_wealth.htm">The Transience of Earthly Wealth</a></b><br>Earthly riches, no matter how luxurious, are temporary and will ultimately perish.

Such was the attire of the harlot (<a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>). Writers have endeavoured to classify in various ways the articles mentioned, in order to obtain some signification from the numbers used. Thus Hengstenberg sees four hard and then four soft articles mentioned, and he reminds us that the number four is symbolical of the world: but this does not carry him beyond ver. 12. The articles enumerated seem naturally to fall into six classes (from which we can gather no information, unless we look upon six as typifying the world, as in <a href="/revelation/13-18.htm">Revelation 13:18</a>). First, articles of personal adornment; second, articles used for furniture, etc.; third, objects of sensual gratification - smell, etc.; fourth, articles of food; fifth, animate possessions; sixth, souls of men. These certainly seem to be arranged in a kind of progressive order of importance. All the articles mentioned in the text above were of the highest value. <span class="accented">Purple</span> and <span class="accented">scarlet</span> (see <a href="/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>) were the prerogative of kings; <span class="accented">silk</span> was so scarce, that its use was forbidden in the reign of Tiberius. <span class="cmt_word">And all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;</span> <span class="accented">and every ivory vessel, and every vessel</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Thyine wood</span> is "that of the <span class="accented">Thuya articulata</span>, Desfont., the <span class="accented">Callitris quadrivalvis</span> of present botanists. This tree was much prized by the ancient Greeks and Romans, on account of the beauty of its wood for various ornamental purposes. By the Romans the tree was called citrus, the wood citrum. It is a native of Barbary, and grows to the height of fifteen to twenty-five feet" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible ').
