The idea of sins reaching heaven signifies the enormity and severity of Babylon's transgressions. In the biblical context, Babylon often symbolizes a system of worldly power and corruption, opposing God's kingdom. The phrase suggests that the sins of this symbolic Babylon are so vast and egregious that they demand divine attention and judgment. This imagery also connects to the Old Testament, where the sins of nations like Sodom and Gomorrah were so great that they cried out to God for judgment (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>).<p><b>and God has remembered her iniquities</b><br>The concept of God "remembering" iniquities implies that He is now acting upon them, not that He had forgotten them. In biblical terms, when God remembers, it often leads to action, whether in mercy or judgment. This is seen in <a href="/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>, where God "remembered" Noah and acted to end the flood. Here, God's remembrance of Babylon's iniquities indicates that the time for judgment has come. Theologically, this reflects God's justice and holiness, as He cannot overlook sin indefinitely. The phrase underscores the certainty of divine retribution for persistent rebellion and wickedness, aligning with the prophetic warnings throughout Scripture that God will ultimately judge the unrepentant (<a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon_the_great.htm">Babylon the Great</a></b><br>Symbolic of a powerful, corrupt system or city that opposes God and leads people into sin.

When God &#8220;remembered&#8221; Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>) it led to deliverance; when He &#8220;remembers&#8221; sin, it leads to judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/14-10.htm">Jeremiah 14:10</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/16-19.htm">Revelation 16:19</a> already declared, &#8220;God remembered Babylon the great and gave her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath,&#8221; showing Chapter 18 as the fulfillment of that promise.<p>&#8226; This ensures justice: &#8220;The LORD is slow to anger but will by no means leave the guilty unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/nahum/1-3.htm">Nahum 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers take comfort that evil will not slip through the cracks; God&#8217;s memory is perfect, and His timing impeccable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Babylon&#8217;s sins have accumulated unchecked, ascending like a foul monument into God&#8217;s own dwelling place. Their sheer volume demands His notice, and He responds by &#8220;remembering&#8221;&#8212;moving decisively to judge.
