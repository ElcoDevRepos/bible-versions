The sounding of the trumpet signifies a divine announcement or a call to action, often associated with judgment or significant events in biblical literature. Trumpets were used in ancient Israel for various purposes, including signaling war, gathering people, and announcing festivals (<a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>). The trumpet judgments follow the seal judgments and precede the bowl judgments, indicating a progression of divine wrath during the end times.<p><b>and something like a great mountain burning with fire</b><br>The imagery of a "great mountain burning with fire" suggests a catastrophic event, possibly a volcanic eruption or a massive meteor impact. Mountains in biblical symbolism often represent kingdoms or large, immovable entities (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>). The burning aspect indicates destruction and judgment, reminiscent of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah with fire and brimstone (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). This imagery may also echo the plagues of Egypt, where natural elements were used as instruments of divine judgment (<a href="/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>).<p><b>was thrown into the sea</b><br>The act of being "thrown into the sea" signifies a sudden and forceful event, emphasizing the power and authority of God over creation. The sea in biblical times was often seen as a symbol of chaos and danger (<a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2-3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>). In the context of Revelation, the sea could represent the nations or peoples of the world (<a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>). This event may symbolize the upheaval and judgment upon the world's systems and powers.<p><b>A third of the sea turned to blood</b><br>This phrase indicates a partial judgment, as only a third of the sea is affected. The turning of water into blood is reminiscent of the first plague in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/7-20.htm">Exodus 7:20-21</a>), symbolizing death and divine retribution. Blood in the sea would result in the death of marine life and disrupt trade and travel, leading to economic and ecological disaster. The fraction "a third" is significant in Revelation, often indicating a limited but severe judgment, allowing for repentance and warning of greater judgments to come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/second_angel.htm">Second Angel</a></b><br>One of the seven angels who sound the trumpets, each heralding a significant event in the unfolding of God's judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_mountain_burning_with_fire.htm">Great Mountain Burning with Fire</a></b><br>Symbolic imagery representing a catastrophic event or judgment.

Just as seven priests blew seven trumpets before the walls of Jericho fell (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-20</a>), seven angels now sound seven trumpets to announce judgments that will dismantle the world&#8217;s proud defenses. The trumpet, throughout Scripture, signals divine intervention&#8212;whether at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-19</a>) or at Christ&#8217;s return (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). In <a href="/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6-7</a> the first trumpet affected a third of the earth; the second now targets the sea. Notice the pattern: partial judgments that warn and call humanity to repentance before the final, total outpouring seen later in <a href="/bsb/revelation/16.htm">Revelation 16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea</b><p>John uses &#8220;something like&#8221; to describe a literal object whose exact nature he cannot classify. Several possibilities line up with a plain reading:<p>&#8226; A massive meteor or asteroid, blazing as it enters Earth&#8217;s atmosphere (<a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>).<p>&#8226; A fiery volcanic mass collapsing into the ocean.<p>Either phenomenon would fit the image of a &#8220;great mountain&#8221; aflame. <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a> calls Babylon &#8220;the destroying mountain,&#8221; so some see a symbolic echo of human kingdoms toppled by God. Yet the straightforward wording&#8212;&#8220;was thrown into the sea&#8221;&#8212;points to an actual cataclysm God sovereignly directs, mirroring how He hurled great stones in prophetic acts before (<a href="/jeremiah/19-10.htm">Jeremiah 19:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A third of the sea turned to blood</b><p>The impact contaminates one-third of the saltwater oceans. The partial fraction lines up with earlier trumpet judgments (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7, 10, 12</a>). As with the first Egyptian plague, where the Nile became blood (<a href="/exodus/7-17.htm">Exodus 7:17-21</a>), God strikes a life-source to expose false security. <a href="/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a> later records the sea &#8220;turned to blood like that of a dead man&#8221; in totality; the second trumpet is therefore a merciful warning shot before the full bowl judgments arrive. Turning the sea to blood implies:<p>&#8226; Massive marine die-off (foreshadowed in <a href="/revelation/8-9.htm">Revelation 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Disruption of global commerce and food supply (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; A vivid reminder that &#8220;the earth is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>) and He may reclaim it at will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The second trumpet announces a literal, divinely directed catastrophe: a fiery mass plunges into the ocean, corrupting a third of the seas with blood. This partial judgment echoes past acts of God&#8212;Jericho&#8217;s trumpets, the plagues on Egypt, prophetic symbols in Jeremiah&#8212;and anticipates the final outpourings later in Revelation. It stands as a tangible call to repent, trust the Creator, and recognize His sovereign right to judge and to save.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8, 9) <span class= "bld">And the second angel </span>. . .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the second angel sounded</span>, <span class= "ital">and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures that were in the sea died, those which have lives; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</span> The sea becoming blood reminds us again of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/context/exodus/7-20.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.">Exodus 7:20-21</a>); but we must once more note the variation. It is not an uplifted rod like that of Moses which produces this result: it is the casting into the sea of a huge mass, as it were a great mountain, burning with fire. Professor Stuart calls this image appropriate or peculiar to St. John. The prophet Jeremiah, however, in a chapter which in many particulars is parallel to this and the following chapter (comp. <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>), makes use of a very similar image: "Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the Lord, which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain" (<a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm" title="Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, said the LORD, which destroy all the earth: and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). The mountain was the emblem, in Jeremiah's prophecy, of the strong consolidated power and institutions of Babylon. Not only must the loftiness of man be brought low, but the mountains which they made so strong for themselves. The power of God's advancing cause would hurl the rooted mountains from their base. The power of faith, Christ declared, would suffice to do this (<a href="/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>); and it is at least a singular coincidence that this saying of the Lord's respecting the overthrow of a mountain should occur in His own comment on the destruction of the fig-tree, just as, in this chapter, the vision of the mountain overthrown follows that of the destruction of tree and grass life. Our Lord encourages the faith of His disciples: "Your power will not only expose the pretentious religionisms of the world, as My word has shown the worthlessness of this tree, but you will overthrow also the long established usages and evil customs of nations which corrupt the world." The powers which seemed strong as the great mountains would be seen to be but evil powers, burning, poisoning, destroying; but its power to destroy is checked: it is cast into the sea. Yet no great institution, or nationality, or evil principle is overthrown without some corresponding disadvantages. The falling mountain carries evil even in its fall, the sea becomes blood, the ships are destroyed. The fall of a great nation--a Babylon-- is always fraught with unavoidable miseries to the world and its nations. Doubtless, the interests of commerce and shipping suffer; but this is not, it seems to me, the point of the vision. The symbolism is only weakened by supposing an allegorical mountain to fall into a literal sea and to destroy literal ships. The force of the vision is that certain gigantic forms of evil will be overthrown, but the overthrow will be accompanied with the development of new evils: the advance is made, but the step forward unveils the subtle force of evil. Every corrupt institution is destroyed with the risk of the evil elements diffusing themselves elsewhere; just as the political victory of Christianity was followed by the infusion of certain Pagan elements into the Church. The vanquished always manage to impose some laws on the victor. Even the advance of the Church is accompanied by some such experience.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea.</span> <a href="/jeremiah/2-25.htm">Jeremiah 2:25</a> contains a somewhat similar description, with, however, a different meaning. There the mountain is the heathen power; here it is the instrument of the punishment of the ungodly world. Alford objects to calling the mountain a volcano, though that, or something of the same nature, seems obviously to be meant. The contiguity of such appearances to St. John in the Isle of Patmos may have suggested the idea. The judgments appear to increase in severity as we go on. The first affects vegetation, thus causing trouble, but not destruction to men; the second begins to affect animal life; the third causes many men to die; and the following ones affect men as direct punishments. The vision may be said generally to typify great trouble and commotion. The figure is used in other places to denote something remarkable and awe inspiring (cf. <a href="/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="/job/9-5.htm">Job 9:5</a>; <a href="/job/28-9.htm">Job 28:9</a>; <a href="/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-20.htm">Ezekiel 38:20</a>; <a href="/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>; <a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>). It is also the symbol of a great power. In <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> it signifies the Church; in <a href="/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a> an earthly power; in <a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> the enemies of Israel. We may therefore conclude that a judgment of great magnitude and force is foretold; and though it is possible to point to particular events (such as the overthrow of Rome by the Gothic power) as a fulfilment of the prophecy, yet we must remember that the complete fulfilment will not he accomplished until "all enemies are put under his feet." <span class="cmt_word">And the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed;</span> <span class="accented">even they that had life</span> (Revised Version). (On the "third part," see on ver. 7.) Whether one third part of the sea, separated in some way from the rest, and all the creatures in that third part, or whether a third part diffused over the whole extent, is meant, it is impossible to say. The whole is a vision, and not subject to natural laws. The meaning is evident. As before, a large part, but not the largest, is signified and this time the judgment is directed against another portion of creation. The sea, as well as the productions of the earth, can be used by God as his agent by which to punish and warn mankind. The attempt to press the vision into a particular application has led to a variety of interpretations. Wordsworth and Elliott both think that the destruction of Roman ships is foretold; the former pointing to the ships as the instruments of commerce and luxury, the latter referring to the destruction of the Roman navy. Bengel, Grotius, Vitringa, see here a vision of war'. Hengstenberg believes the <span class="accented">sea to</span> typify this world; the <span class="accented">living creatures</span>, mankind; and the <span class="accented">ships</span>, villages and towns. Those who place the fulfilment of the vision in time subsequent to the sealing of <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7</a>. fail to see that the trumpets do not follow the seals in chronological order, but that both are being fulfilled side by side in the same epoch; viz. that of the existence of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/8-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
