This act of falling at the feet is a common biblical expression of reverence and submission, seen in other instances such as <a href="/daniel/8-17.htm">Daniel 8:17</a> and <a href="/acts/10-25.htm">Acts 10:25</a>. However, it is important to note that worship is reserved for God alone, as emphasized throughout Scripture (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>But he told me, &#8220;Do not do that!</b><br>The angel's immediate correction highlights the distinction between Creator and creation. Angels, though powerful and holy, are not to be worshipped. This aligns with biblical teachings against idolatry and the worship of anything other than God (<a href="/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>).<p><b>I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who rely on the testimony of Jesus.</b><br>The angel identifies himself as a servant, emphasizing the equality of all who serve God, whether human or angelic. This reflects the biblical theme of servanthood found in <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>. The "testimony of Jesus" refers to the witness and proclamation of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection, central to Christian faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-4</a>).<p><b>Worship God!</b><br>This command reiterates the first commandment and the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), underscoring monotheism and the exclusive worship due to God. It serves as a reminder of the ultimate purpose of all creation: to glorify God (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>).<p><b>For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase connects the message of Jesus with the broader biblical narrative of prophecy. Prophecy in the Bible often points to the coming of Christ and the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>). The "spirit of prophecy" suggests that true prophecy will always testify to Jesus, aligning with the purpose of Scripture to reveal Christ (<a href="/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the Book of Revelation, who receives visions and messages from God while exiled on the island of Patmos.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A heavenly messenger who delivers divine revelations to John.

The angel clarifies that he is merely a fellow servant, reinforces the command to worship God alone, and explains that genuine prophecy exists to testify about Jesus. The passage calls believers to guard against misplaced reverence, to remember our shared servant status with all heaven, and to keep Christ at the center of every prophetic word and act of worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And I fell at his feet . . .</span>--The impulse to worship the messenger who had unfolded such visions was not unnatural: the immediate checking of it here and in <a href="/context/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8-9</a>, on the part of the angel, supplies an indirect evidence of the genuineness of the whole book, and gives it a moral tone immeasurably superior to the vision-books of pretended revelations. <span class= "ital">And he saith to me, See</span> (or, <span class= "ital">take heed</span>)<span class= "ital"> not</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, <span class= "ital">to do it</span>)<span class= "ital">; I am a fellow-servant of thee and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus: worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> One bond of service unites angels and men: to be servants of God is the highest title they can attain; worship is for God alone. The words "worship God" are most emphatic: "to God give thy worship, and not to me, who am but thy fellow-servant." The angel is his fellow-servant, and at that time he was emphatically so, as he and the Apostle were engaged in one common work--"the testimony of Jesus." The Apostle's work in the world was the testimony of Jesus (<a href="/revelation/1-2.htm" title="Who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.">Revelation 1:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm" title="I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.">Revelation 1:9</a>), and the Spirit of prophecy which moved (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>) the angel was likewise the testimony of Jesus. One work and one worship belong to both. He whom Apostles worshipped unrebuked (<a href="/matthew/28-9.htm" title="And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.">Matthew 28:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-17.htm" title="And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.">Matthew 28:17</a>) was the one whom all the angels of God were bidden to worship (<a href="/psalms/97-7.htm" title="Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all you gods.">Psalm 97:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>). It is wonderful, with this emphatic witness to our Lord Jesus Christ, any should have undervalued this book of Revelation, as one which failed to honour Him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I fell at his feet to worship him.</span> The same thing happens again in <a href="/revelation/20-7.htm">Revelation 20:7, 8</a>, and this makes it improbable that St. John imagined the angel to be Christ himself, as some think. More probably (as Alford, Bengel, Vitringa, Wordsworth, and others) St. John was so overwhelmed with the tremendous character of the revelation just made to him, that in his humility he pays undue reverence to the angel who had communicated it to him. This reverence may not have been exactly of the nature of that which he would render to God; but it is evident, from the reproof of the angel, that it was more than could be becomingly and safely paid to a created being. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus;</span> <span class="accented">saith</span>... <span class="accented">I am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren</span>, etc. So the apostles styled themselves (<a href="/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>, etc.). (On "hold the testimony of Jesus," see <a href="/revelation/1-2.htm">Revelation 1:2, 9</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-17.htm">Revelation 12:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Worship God.</span> Such also is the command of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> Like the words of ver. 8, these words are probably an explanation added by St. John. To prophesy is to understand and proclaim the truth concerning God, especially in the face of prevalent ignorance or opposition; this is also what is meant by holding "the testimony of Jesus." The angel in revealing these visions, the martyrs in openly professing Christ, St. John in receiving and handing on the Apocalypse, were prophesying. Thus it was that the angel announces himself to be the fellow servant of St. John, and a fellow servant with the prophets, and with those "who keep the sayings of this book" (<a href="/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/19-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I fell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(epesa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4098.htm">Strong's 4098: </a> </span><span class="str2">A reduplicated and contracted form of peto; probably akin to petomai through the idea of alighting; to fall.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#956;&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(emprosthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1715.htm">Strong's 1715: </a> </span><span class="str2">From en and pros; in front of (literally or figuratively) or time).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
