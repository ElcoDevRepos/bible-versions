The east often represents the direction of divine intervention and blessing. In the Old Testament, the east is associated with the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>) and the arrival of the Magi from the east to worship Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2.htm">Matthew 2:1-2</a>). The angel's ascent suggests a divine mission or message, emphasizing the importance of the task at hand. The east is also where the sun rises, symbolizing new beginnings and hope.<p><b>with the seal of the living God</b><br>The seal represents ownership, protection, and authenticity. In ancient times, a seal was used to mark documents or possessions, indicating authority and security. The "living God" contrasts with idols and false gods, emphasizing the true and active nature of God. This seal signifies God's protection over His people, reminiscent of the blood on the doorposts during the Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-7.htm">Exodus 12:7, 13</a>) and the sealing of the 144,000 in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4</a>. It assures believers of their security in Christ and their identity as God's chosen.<p><b>And he called out in a loud voice</b><br>The loud voice indicates urgency and authority. In biblical narratives, a loud voice often precedes significant announcements or divine commands (e.g., <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10, 14</a>:7). This emphasizes the importance of the message being delivered and ensures that it is heard by all intended recipients. The angel's proclamation is a divine directive that must be heeded.<p><b>to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea</b><br>The four angels represent agents of divine judgment, holding back the winds of destruction (<a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>). Their power to harm the land and sea signifies impending judgment upon creation, reflecting the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament prophecies of judgment (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36-37</a>) and the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11). The restraint of these angels until the sealing is complete highlights God's mercy and the protection of His people amidst judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/another_angel.htm">Another Angel</a></b><br>This angel is distinct from the four angels mentioned earlier in <a href="/revelation/7.htm">Revelation 7:1</a>.

The passage spotlights three truths: God&#8217;s light precedes His wrath, His seal guarantees protection for His people, and even devastating angels operate on Heaven&#8217;s timetable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And I saw another angel . </span>. .--Translate, <span class= "ital">And I saw another angel going up from the rising of the sun, having a seal of the living God, and he was crying with a great voice to the four angels to whom it was given to injure the earth and the sea, saying, Injure ye not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.</span> The angels appear as carrying out the purposes of God. This angel rises into view from the door of the dawn. In the midst of the dark symptoms of coming storm and judgment there springs up a light for the righteous and joyful gladness for such as are true-hearted: they need not be afraid of evil tidings whose hearts stand fast believing in the Lord. This angel carries a seal of the living God. The seal is the emblem of security. The seal was placed on our Lord's sepulchre to keep the tomb safe from invasion; the king's seal was, in the same way, placed on the stone which was laid at the mouth of the den in which Daniel was imprisoned: "the king sealed it with his own signet" (<a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>). The intrusting of the seal into the hands of others was the token that royal authority had been for the time delegated to man. So Jezebel "wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal" (<a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm" title="So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.">1Kings 21:8</a>). Esther obtained the use of the king's seal to protect her countrymen from the mischief devised by Haman: "for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse" (<a href="/esther/8-8.htm" title="Write you also for the Jews, as it likes you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.">Esther 8:8</a>). There is also a seal of the living God. St. Paul tells us that this seal bears two legends. "The foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, 'The Lord knoweth them that are his,' and, ' Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity'" (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2Timothy 2:19</a>). On the one side, it is dependence on and communion with God; on the other side, it is holiness of life. The sealed are found in Christ, not having their own righteousness, but the righteousness which is of God by faith (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Philippians 3:9</a>). For this is the righteousness which will endure to the end, and which is found in them who are "sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance" (<a href="/context/ephesians/1-13.htm" title="In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>). God's image and superscription is impressed on such; just as afterwards we are told of all the servants of God, "His name shall be in their foreheads" (<a href="/revelation/22-4.htm" title="And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.">Revelation 22:4</a>). This token is a true safe-guard and talisman; as the sprinkled blood on the lintel protected the house from the destroying angel at the first Passover. It is a token also of those who have not conformed to the evil world; they are like those whom Ezekiel saw in Jerusalem, when the Lord sent the man with the inkhorn "to set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done" (<a href="/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a>). There has been much misapprehension respecting this act of sealing. It has been said that it implies security, and assures God's servants of protection in the coming judgments: this is, in a sense, true; but the sealing, as will have been seen by the passages quoted above, is that sealing of the Spirit, that root of heavenly life in the soul, which is the pledge of the soul's union with God; and the terms of the charter of their protection are, Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? In the Bible idea, sin, or moral defilement, is the only real evil: all other things work together for good. The breastplate which turns aside the fiery darts is the breastplate of righteousness: those who, escaping the corruptions which are in the world through lust, become partakers of the divine nature are in consequence victorious over all the evil. They are not exempt from the vicissitudes and tribulation of life: the winds are let loose to blow, but they are sealed, and they cannot be shaken; for what and who can separate them from the love of Christ? They are sealed by the Holy Spirit; they have an earnest of that Spirit in their hearts (<a href="/ephesians/4-30.htm" title="And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.">Ephesians 4:30</a>, and <a href="/2_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="Who has also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.">2Corinthians 1:22</a>), and the pledge of His power in their lives. St. John gives the same two-fold test as St. Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/2-9.htm" title="Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.">2Timothy 2:9</a>): (1) "Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit" (<a href="/1_john/4-13.htm" title="Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.">1John 4:13</a>); and (2) "Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments" (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3</a>). The sealing is on the forehead: it is God's mark, but it is where all may see it. "By their fruits ye shall know them." The cry of the angel is, Injure not the sea nor the trees. Doubtless the sea and trees are mentioned as these are the objects which would be most disturbed and injured by a storm of wind. Trees are used as emblems of real and of pretended religionism. The true-hearted in faith are described as trees planted by the waterside, whose fruit does not wither; and it is singular that St. Jude, who pictures the Antinomian teachers of his day under the image of autumn trees (not trees whose fruit withereth, as in English version) without fruit, immediately adds an expression which almost suggests the sudden uprising of a testing storm: the fruitless trees are "plucked up by the roots" (<a href="/jude/1-12.htm" title="These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit wither, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;">Jude 1:12</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw another angel ascending from the east;</span> <span class="accented">from the rising of the sun.</span> Again no individual angel is particularized, though an archangel <span class="accented">may</span> be intended, as he has authority over the first four. He proceeds from that quarter whence comes light; and, like the Sun of Righteousness, he rises with healing in his wings; for his mission is to render secure the servants of God. Wordsworth thinks Christ, or a messenger from Christ, is meant - a view shared by Hengstenberg; Vitringa says the Holy Ghost; Victorinus, the Prophet Elijah. That this angel was of like nature with the first four appears probable from the words in ver. 3, "till we have sealed the servants of our God." Having the seal of the living God. The sealing instrument with which they seal God's servants. Of its nature we are told nothing beyond what is contained in ver. 3. He is specially referred to as "the <span class="accented">living</span> God," since, by this sealing, <span class="accented">life</span> is imparted. We have here the shorter expression, "the living God," not, as in all ether places of the Apocalypse, "him that liveth forever and ever" (see <a href="/revelation/4-9.htm">Revelation 4:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-14.htm">Revelation 5:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-7.htm">Revelation 15:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels</span> (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-2.htm">Revelation 5:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea;</span> that is, by letting loose the winds, as shown by vers. 1 and 3. Bengel and Rinck, looking only at the immediate context, thought that the hurt was done by preventing the winds from blowing on the earth and cooling it in the scorching plagues which follow (<a href="/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>). The <span class="accented">trees</span> are not mentioned, being included in <span class="accented">the earth</span>; and this appears to indicate that the expression, "the earth, the sea, and the trees" (vers. 1 and 3), signifies the world in general, without being intended to represent individual parts, as the great men, etc. (see on Revelation 5:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#948;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eidon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(allon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_243.htm">Strong's 243: </a> </span><span class="str2">Other, another (of more than two), different.
