In biblical numerology, the number seven often signifies completion or perfection, indicating the fulfillment of God's plan. The trumpet is a symbol of divine intervention and announcement, reminiscent of the trumpets used in the Old Testament to signal important events (e.g., <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>, the fall of Jericho). This trumpet heralds the transition from the current world order to the reign of God.<p><b>and loud voices called out in heaven:</b><br>The loud voices in heaven suggest a heavenly chorus or assembly, possibly the angels or the redeemed saints, proclaiming a significant declaration. This reflects the heavenly perspective on earthly events, emphasizing the divine authority and the importance of the proclamation. The use of "loud voices" underscores the magnitude and certainty of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ,</b><br>This phrase signifies the transfer of power and authority from earthly kingdoms to the divine rule of God and His Messiah. It echoes the prophetic visions found in <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>, where dominion is given to the Son of Man. The phrase "our Lord and of His Christ" highlights the unity and shared authority between God the Father and Jesus Christ, affirming the messianic fulfillment and the ultimate sovereignty of Christ over all creation.<p><b>and He will reign forever and ever.&#8221;</b><br>The eternal reign of Christ is a central theme in Christian eschatology, affirming the everlasting nature of His kingdom. This echoes the promises found in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, where the government and peace of the Messiah's kingdom are described as having no end. The phrase "forever and ever" emphasizes the permanence and unchanging nature of Christ's rule, offering hope and assurance to believers of the ultimate victory and justice of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seventh_angel.htm">Seventh Angel</a></b><br>The seventh angel is one of the series of angels who sound trumpets in the Book of Revelation, each heralding significant events in the unfolding of God's plan.

"Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession" (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm" title="Ask of me, and I shall give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.">Psalm 2:8</a>). It is the kingdom--not, as in the English version, "the kingdoms"--of the world which has become Christ's possession. The contest is not for the kingdoms, the separate nationalities: the varying political systems might exist, as far as mere organisation is concerned, under the rule of Christ; the contest is for the kingdom of the world. Satan was willing to surrender the kingdoms of the world to our Lord on condition of a homage which would have left him still in possession of the kingdom of the world. But now the close of the contest is the overthrow of the kingdom of evil, the establishment of the kingdom of good: that is, of God; <span class= "ital">and He shall reign for ever and ever.</span> Dean Alford pointed out that our familiarity with the "Hallelujah Chorus" tempted us to put an emphasis on the word <span class= "ital">He </span>which is not sanctioned by the Greek; it is the <span class= "ital">reign</span> of the Lord which is the prominent thought. The reign is unto the ages of ages. Surely this means <span class= "ital">always. </span>We are not told whose voices sing this chorus; it is just the tumultuous sound of heavenly voices, growing into natural and irresistible chorus as the trumpet heralds the approach of the glorious end.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying</span>. The participle "saying" is masculine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, in A, B; the feminine, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is read in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, C, P. Though the latter would be more correct, grammatically, yet irregular construction in such cases is not uncommon in the Apocalypse. The <span class="accented">voices</span> were possibly those of the angels rejoicing in the triumph of the kingdom of God. Or perhaps they proceeded from the four living beings, since the elders are next mentioned (ver. 17) as offering the praises of the redeemed Church which they represent. At the opening of the seventh seal there was silence in heaven; here, at the sound of the seventh angel's trumpet, <span class="accented">voices</span> are heard "in heaven," but there is silence as to the fate of the wicked, with whom the trumpet visions have been chiefly concerned. In the revelation of the fate in store for the Church, as well as in that of the doom awarded to the ungodly, the visions stop short of describing circumstances connected with the life after the judgment day. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdoms of this world are become</span> the kingdoms <span class="cmt_word">of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the singular, is found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, P, and versions, and is adopted by the Revised Version. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, the plural, is read in two cursives. We can understand the first part of this verse by referring to <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>. God's power and authority is established by the final overthrow of Satan. It naturally follows the account, in vers. 12, 13, of the vindication of God's witnesses, and of the glory rendered by the rest of mankind. With God the Father is associated Christ, by whose means the overthrow of the devil is effected, and by whom his servants overcome (cf. <a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-11.htm">Revelation 12:11</a>).
