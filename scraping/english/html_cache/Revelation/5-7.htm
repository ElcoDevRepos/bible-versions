In the context of Revelation, this action is significant as it demonstrates His authority and readiness to fulfill the divine plan. The imagery of coming is reminiscent of Old Testament theophanies where God approaches His people, such as in <a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a> when God descends on Mount Sinai.<p><b>and took the scroll</b><br>The scroll represents the divine will and the unfolding of God's plan for the end times. In ancient times, scrolls were used to record important decrees and legal documents. The act of taking the scroll indicates that Jesus is the only one worthy to execute God's plan, as no one else in heaven or on earth was found worthy (<a href="/revelation/5-3.htm">Revelation 5:3-5</a>). This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given authority and a kingdom.<p><b>from the right hand</b><br>The right hand is a symbol of power and authority in biblical literature. It signifies the place of honor and strength. In <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, the Messiah is invited to sit at the right hand of God, indicating a position of co-regency and shared authority. The act of taking the scroll from the right hand underscores the transfer of authority to execute judgment and redemption.<p><b>of the One seated on the throne</b><br>This phrase identifies God the Father as the sovereign ruler of the universe, seated on His throne. The throne is a central image in Revelation, symbolizing God's ultimate authority and control over all creation. The scene echoes <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where the prophet sees the Lord seated on a high and exalted throne, emphasizing His majesty and holiness. The interaction between the One on the throne and the Lamb highlights the unity and distinct roles within the Trinity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lamb.htm">The Lamb</a></b><br>This refers to Jesus Christ, depicted as the Lamb who is worthy to take the scroll.

The throne represents His sovereign authority and power over all creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_scroll.htm">The Scroll</a></b><br>The scroll is a symbol of God's ultimate plan and purpose for the world. It is sealed, indicating that its contents are hidden and can only be revealed by one who is worthy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_throne_room.htm">Heavenly Throne Room</a></b><br>The setting is the heavenly throne room, a place of divine majesty and worship, where the events of Revelation unfold.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_taking_the_scroll.htm">The Act of Taking the Scroll</a></b><br>This event signifies the transfer of authority and the initiation of the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_worthiness_of_christ.htm">The Worthiness of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus is uniquely worthy to take the scroll because of His sacrificial death and resurrection.

The Lamb is the risen Christ, physically present and moving with purpose.<p>- His approach signals divine initiative&#8212;God Himself stepping into history&#8217;s next phase, just as He stepped into our world in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>- Scripture consistently shows the Son drawing near at decisive moments&#8212;think of Jesus walking on the water to the disciples (<a href="/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>) or appearing to Saul on the Damascus road (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-5</a>). <a href="/bsb/revelation/5.htm">Revelation 5</a> portrays the ultimate heavenly counterpart to those earth-side appearances.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took the scroll</b><p>- The scroll is &#8220;written on both sides, sealed with seven seals&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>), containing God&#8217;s comprehensive plan of judgment and redemption.<p>- No one else could open it (<a href="/revelation/5-3.htm">Revelation 5:3-4</a>), underlining the unique authority of Christ, much like Peter&#8217;s testimony: &#8220;There is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved&#8221; (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p>- His act of taking the scroll confirms His worthiness celebrated moments earlier: &#8220;Worthy are You&#8230; for You were slain, and by Your blood You purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the right hand</b><p>- In Scripture, the right hand represents power and honor (<a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>- Jesus is not seizing but receiving what is His by right, echoing His promise in <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>: &#8220;The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.&#8221;<p>- This transfer assures believers that the future is securely in the hands of the One who loved them to the cross (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the One seated on the throne</b><p>- The throne scene emphasizes the Father&#8217;s sovereign rule (<a href="/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2-3</a>). Yet Father and Son act in perfect unity, reflecting Jesus&#8217; words: &#8220;I and the Father are one&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p>- The hand-off underscores distinction within the Godhead while preserving oneness of purpose&#8212;similar to the baptism scene where the Father speaks, the Spirit descends, and the Son stands in the water (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>).<p>- Heaven&#8217;s focus remains on God&#8217;s glory, now revealed through the Lamb&#8217;s redemptive mission (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/5-7.htm">Revelation 5:7</a> depicts the triumphant Lamb approaching the Father&#8217;s throne, receiving the sealed scroll, and thereby taking up His rightful authority to unfold God&#8217;s end-time plan. Every phrase highlights Jesus&#8217; unique worthiness, the Father&#8217;s sovereign endorsement, and the certainty that history is moving under their unified, loving rule&#8212;a truth that anchors believers&#8217; hope and worship today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he came </span>. . .--Better, <span class= "ital">And He came, and He has taken</span> (omit the words "the book," and supply) <span class= "ital">it (i.e.,</span> the roll) <span class= "ital">out of the right hand of Him that sitteth upon the throne.</span> There is a change of tense ("came," "has taken"), which seems to be due to the rapt attention of the seer, whose narrative trembles with his own intensity of feeling. He wept awhile ago; now he need not weep. The Lamb conquered; He came; He has taken the roll. He is the wisdom of the Church; among all pre-eminent; all things will be reconciled in Him; the purpose and meaning of all life's mysteries and sorrows will be made plain in Him. (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>; <a href="/context/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came and took the book;</span> or, <span class="accented">and he came and he hath taken it.</span> "Hath taken" is perfect (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;</span>), while "came" is the aorist (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>). If the differ-once is intentionally significant, it renders the description somewhat more vivid. (For the consideration of the question <span class="accented">how</span> the Lamb could do this, see on ver. 6.) Wordsworth contrasts the spontaneous act of the Lamb in taking the book of his own accord as his right, with the call to St. John to take the little book (<a href="/revelation/10-8.htm">Revelation 10:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Out of the right hand.</span> The position of power and honour.
