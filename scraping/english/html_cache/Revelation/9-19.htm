In biblical symbolism, the mouth often represents speech or proclamation, suggesting that the power in their mouths could symbolize deceptive or destructive messages. The tails, likened to snakes, indicate a hidden, insidious danger. This duality of power can be seen as a representation of both overt and covert forms of spiritual or physical attack. The imagery of horses with such power may also connect to the four horsemen of the apocalypse earlier in Revelation, who bring various forms of judgment upon the earth.<p><b>indeed, their tails were like snakes,</b><br>The comparison of the tails to snakes evokes the image of the serpent in Genesis, which is often associated with Satan and deception. This imagery suggests that the harm inflicted by these creatures is not only physical but also spiritual, involving deceit and leading people away from truth. Snakes in the ancient world were often seen as symbols of danger and cunning, reinforcing the idea of a subtle, yet deadly threat.<p><b>having heads with which to inflict harm.</b><br>The presence of heads on the tails emphasizes the intentional and directed nature of the harm caused. This could symbolize false teachings or ideologies that lead people astray, as heads often represent authority or leadership. The ability to inflict harm suggests a period of intense spiritual warfare or tribulation, aligning with the broader themes of judgment and testing found throughout Revelation. This imagery may also connect to the prophetic warnings in the Old Testament about false prophets and leaders who mislead the people of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses.htm">Horses</a></b><br>Symbolic creatures in John's vision, representing agents of judgment and destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tails_like_snakes.htm">Tails like Snakes</a></b><br>The tails of these horses are described as serpentine, indicating deception and harm.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heads_on_tails.htm">Heads on Tails</a></b><br>The heads on the tails suggest intelligence and intentionality in their destructive power.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/infliction_of_harm.htm">Infliction of Harm</a></b><br>The primary action of these creatures, emphasizing the severity of the judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/vision_of_john.htm">Vision of John</a></b><br>The Apostle John receives this vision while exiled on the island of Patmos, as part of the larger revelation of end-time events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_judgment.htm">Symbolism of Judgment</a></b><br>The imagery of horses with serpentine tails highlights the multifaceted nature of divine judgment, combining both overt power and subtle deception.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/deception_and_harm.htm">Deception and Harm</a></b><br>The description of the tails as snakes with heads underscores the cunning and intentional nature of evil.

That deadly stream is no illusion; it kills one-third of mankind.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that evil can be vocal and consuming. As the prophets warned, &#8220;I will make My words in your mouth a fire&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-14.htm">Jeremiah 5:14</a>), and in <a href="/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5</a> fire issues from the mouths of the two witnesses. Here, by contrast, the fire comes from a demonic cavalry&#8212;a counterfeit power resembling divine judgment.<p>&#8226; Like the &#8220;lawless one&#8221; whose coming is &#8220;in accordance with the working of Satan, with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>), these creatures manifest supernatural force. Their mouths broadcast both destruction and a hellish message: rebellion against God brings ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in their tails</b><p>&#8226; Destructive might is not confined to the front. Their tails add a second strike, emphasizing inescapability.<p>&#8226; Revelation often uses tails to show sweeping, dragging judgment&#8212;&#8220;his tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah linked tails with false leadership: &#8220;the prophet who teaches lies is the tail&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>). These demonic horses embody that deceit: a blow from behind that people never see coming.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>indeed, their tails were like snakes</b><p>&#8226; The serpent image instantly recalls the dragon, &#8220;that ancient serpent called the devil&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>). By comparing their tails to snakes, John shows that the power behind the cavalry is satanic.<p>&#8226; Snakes strike with stealth and inject venom; so these tails sneak up on the unsuspecting, spreading spiritual poison. Jesus assured His followers, &#8220;I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>), but those who reject Him remain unprotected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>having heads with which to inflict harm</b><p>&#8226; These are not ordinary reptiles; their tails end in heads&#8212;intelligent, purposeful, aggressive. The imagery evokes multiple striking points, multiplying terror (cf. <a href="/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>, &#8220;You will tread on the lion and cobra&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Harm here is literal physical death (<a href="/revelation/9-18.htm">Revelation 9:18</a>) and also moral devastation, echoing Paul&#8217;s warning that Satan &#8220;deceives &#8230; by his craftiness&#8221; (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 11</a>:3).<p>&#8226; God allows this plague as the sixth trumpet. Like the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-14.htm">Exodus 9:14</a>), it exposes hardened hearts; yet people &#8220;still did not repent&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>John describes a demonic cavalry whose mouths spew lethal fire and whose snake-like tails, armed with heads, strike from behind. Their dual power pictures comprehensive judgment&#8212;front and back, seen and unseen&#8212;authorized by God yet energized by Satan. The vision warns that those who resist the Lamb face real, horrific consequences, while urging readers to cling to Christ, whose authority alone overcomes both the serpent and every fiery assault.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails; <span class="accented">for the power f the horses is</span>, etc. Another example of disagreement between Erasmus and all the Greek manuscripts (see on ver. 10). For their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. "Are like," and "have heads," in the present tense. Here (unlike ver. 10) the tails are like serpents themselves. The image is not uncommon among the ancients. We may paraphrase the passage thus: "Their power is for the most part in their mouth; but also, to some extent, in their tails; for their tails are like serpents," etc. An endless variety of interpretations have been given to these details, which are probably not intended to bear any distinct signification. Bengel refers to a species of serpent in which the head and tail were so alike as to be with difficulty distinguished; which he thinks may have suggested the image. Many apply it (though in different ways) to the Turkish horse, who fight as they retreat, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
