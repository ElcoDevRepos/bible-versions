In biblical context, kings often symbolize those with significant influence and control over worldly affairs. The mention of "kings" here underscores the universal scope of the judgment, affecting all levels of society. This aligns with prophecies in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>, where God&#8217;s judgment is pronounced on the kings of the earth.<p><b>the nobles</b><br>Nobles are those of high social status, often holding positions of privilege and influence. Historically, nobles were part of the ruling class, second only to kings. Their inclusion in this passage emphasizes that social status and earthly honor offer no protection from divine judgment. This reflects the biblical theme that God shows no partiality (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><b>the commanders</b><br>Commanders, or military leaders, represent those with authority over armed forces. In ancient times, military power was a significant aspect of a nation's strength. The mention of commanders indicates that even those who wield military might are subject to God's ultimate authority. This is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>, which states that a king is not saved by his great army.<p><b>the rich</b><br>The rich are those with abundant material wealth. In biblical teachings, wealth can often lead to a false sense of security and self-reliance. The inclusion of the rich in this passage serves as a reminder that material possessions cannot shield one from God's judgment. This is echoed in Jesus' teachings, such as in <a href="/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23-24</a>, where He speaks of the difficulty for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.<p><b>the mighty</b><br>The mighty refers to those with great strength or influence, whether physical, political, or social. This term encompasses all who rely on their own power rather than on God. The Bible frequently warns against trusting in human strength, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>, where the Lord advises against boasting in might.<p><b>and every slave and free man</b><br>This phrase indicates that the impending judgment is all-encompassing, affecting every individual regardless of social or economic status. In the Roman world, society was sharply divided between slaves and free men, yet this passage shows that all are equal before God&#8217;s judgment. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither slave nor free.<p><b>hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains</b><br>The act of hiding in caves and among rocks signifies a desperate attempt to escape the wrath of God. Throughout scripture, mountains and caves are often places of refuge or divine encounter, yet here they serve as inadequate shelters from divine judgment. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, where people hide in caves from the terror of the Lord. It underscores the futility of trying to escape God's presence, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_earth.htm">Kings of the Earth</a></b><br>These are the rulers and leaders of nations, representing political power and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nobles.htm">Nobles</a></b><br>Individuals of high social status, often with influence and wealth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders.htm">Commanders</a></b><br>Military leaders responsible for the defense and aggression of nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich_and_the_mighty.htm">The Rich and the Mighty</a></b><br>Those with economic power and influence, often controlling resources and wealth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/every_slave_and_free_man.htm">Every Slave and Free Man</a></b><br>This phrase encompasses all of humanity, regardless of social status, indicating the universal impact of the events described.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/c/caves_and_rocks_of_the_mountains.htm">Caves and Rocks of the Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic places of refuge and hiding, representing the futility of escaping divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_universality_of_judgment.htm">The Universality of Judgment</a></b><br>No one is exempt from God's judgment, regardless of status or power.

From kings to slaves, the entire human hierarchy collapses under the reality of God&#8217;s wrath. Power, rank, wealth, and fame evaporate; caves and mountains become futile hiding places. The verse underscores three timeless truths:<p>&#8226; Judgment is certain and literal.<p>&#8226; No human distinction offers immunity.<p>&#8226; Only surrender to the Lamb provides refuge before that day arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15-17)<span class= "ital"> <span class= "bld">And the</span> <span class= "bld">kings . . .</span>--</span>Translate,<span class= "ital"> And the kings of the earth, and the magnates, and the commanders of hosts, and the wealthy, and the strong, and every man, bond and free, hid themselves (going) into the caves and into the rocks of the mountains; and say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the day, the great (day) of His wrath came (or, </span>is come); and who is able to stand? In the list of the great ones here we may notice the descending order--kings, magnates or statesmen, generals, rich men, strong men, bond and free men. The terror strikes into every class: monarchs and their advisers, the statesmen and diplomatists, the commanders of troops, the merchant princes, the men of ability, as well as the obscurer orders of society. Neither royalty, nor rank, nor force of arms, nor opulence, nor talent, nor strength, either of intellect or frame, avail in that crisis; neither does insignificance escape in that day when God brings to light the hidden things. The tests of God are spiritual, as the weapons of God's war are not carnal. Men who have relied upon wealth, rank, or power, have prepared themselves against one form of trial, but find themselves unarmed in the day of spiritual testing. Like Macbeth, they are unable to fight with the unexpected shape which haunts them. They would rather meet the bodily foe, "who would dare them to the desert with a sword."<p>Thus in the final day of judgment the revealing of the spiritual order of all life will confound men whose minds have been blinded by their entire absorption in world-splendours and world-powers. Nor is it merely the unveiling of the forgotten spiritual order which will confound them. The advent is of a Person. It is more than the manifestation of the kingdom of Him who all this while had been King on His throne, and whom they had forgotten--it is the revealing of God's Son from heaven. It is not without significance that He is described as the Lamb. In that day of His wrath, it is not as a Judge who has laid aside the tokens of His humiliation and suffering: it is as the Lamb. He whom they now shrink from is He who came meek as a lamb, gentle, pure, and suffering on their behalf. He whom they now behold with dismay is He whom they treated with neglect, and whose love they spurned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the earth</span>. The first of the seven classes mentioned. The enumeration is again all extensive, embracing all classes, and men of every degree of social distinction. Bishop Newton is probably not correct in seeing an allusion to particular kings. <span class="cmt_word">And the great men;</span> <span class="accented">princes</span> (Revised Version). <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> are the grandees, the courtiers, as distinguished from those who are governors and hold military command, and who are subsequently mentioned as the "chief captains." <span class="cmt_word">And the rich men, and the chief captains</span>. The Revised Version reverses the order, and places "chief captains" first. The chief captains (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) are those holding military rank (cf. <a href="/mark/6-21.htm">Mark 6:21</a>, "Herod made a supper to his lords, high captains," etc.; <a href="/john/18.htm">John 18</a>, "The captain and officers took Jesus;" <a href="/acts/21-31.htm">Acts 21:31</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, "The chief captain of the band "). <span class="cmt_word">And the mighty men.</span> Probably those possessing great bodily strength. <span class="cmt_word">And every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.</span> "Every" is omitted before "free man" by A, B, C, Vulgate, Syriac, Andreas, and Arethas. <span class="accented">The dens</span>; in Revised Version <span class="accented">caves</span> (cf. <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, "And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth"). Again, as in vers. 12-14, the enumeration is sevenfold; thus denoting the universality and completeness of the extent of the judgment (see <a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-1.htm">Revelation 5:1</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/6-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
