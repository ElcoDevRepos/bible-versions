The imagery of smoke rising is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>), symbolizing complete and irreversible judgment. The phrase "forever and ever" underscores the perpetual state of this torment, aligning with the concept of eternal separation from God as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. The use of smoke also connects to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament, where smoke was a sign of offerings ascending to God, but here it signifies the outcome of divine wrath.<p><b>Day and night there is no rest for those who worship the beast and its image,</b><br>The continuous nature of "day and night" indicates an unending cycle of unrest and suffering, contrasting with the rest promised to the faithful (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>). Worshiping the beast and its image refers to allegiance to worldly powers and systems that oppose God, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/13.htm">Revelation 13</a>. This reflects the historical context of Roman emperor worship, where Christians faced persecution for refusing to participate. The lack of rest is a direct consequence of idolatry and rebellion against God, echoing the warnings found in <a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20-21</a> about the wicked being like a restless sea.<p><b>or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.</b><br>Receiving the mark signifies a deliberate choice to align with the beast, representing ultimate rebellion against God. This mark is symbolic of loyalty and identity, akin to the seal of God on the foreheads of the faithful (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>). The mark of the beast is a counterfeit of God's seal, highlighting the spiritual battle between allegiance to God and allegiance to worldly powers. Historically, this can be seen in the pressure to conform to societal norms that contradict Christian values. The mark serves as a warning against compromising one's faith for temporary security or acceptance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic representation of a powerful, evil entity or system that opposes God and deceives humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_image_of_the_beast.htm">The Image of the Beast</a></b><br>An idol or representation of the beast that demands worship, symbolizing false religion or ideology.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mark_of_the_beast.htm">The Mark of the Beast</a></b><br>A sign of allegiance to the beast, representing a choice against God and His commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tormented.htm">The Tormented</a></b><br>Those who have chosen to worship the beast and receive its mark, facing eternal consequences.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_smoke_of_torment.htm">The Smoke of Torment</a></b><br>A vivid image of eternal punishment, symbolizing the unending nature of the consequences for rejecting God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_eternal_consequences.htm">The Reality of Eternal Consequences</a></b><br>This passage underscores the seriousness of rejecting God and choosing to follow the beast.

Sin, which is first embraced as a delight, becomes soon an inexorable tyrant, by an awful retribution compelling men along the routine of the evil habits which they loathe while they long for, and long for even while they loathe them: there is a destiny of unrest in all sin. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest." It is well that solemn words like these should be read by the light of the most certain of all truths--the power sin has of stamping its indelible features upon the human character, and giving to habit the force of a destiny.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever.</span> Compare the wording of the passages quoted above on ver. 10, especially <a href="/isaiah/34-9.htm">Isaiah 34:9, 10</a>, "The smoke thereof shall go up forever."

Wordsworth says, "<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is a stronger expression than 'those who worship the beast;' it means those whose distinguishing characteristic is that they <span class="accented">are worshipping</span> the beast, and persist in worshipping him, even to the end. This characteristic is so strongly marked that they are here represented as keeping it even after their death." (On the "mark," see on Revelation 13:16-18.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
