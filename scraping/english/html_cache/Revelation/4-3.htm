The imagery of jasper and carnelian is significant. Jasper, in biblical times, was a clear, precious stone, possibly resembling a diamond, symbolizing purity and holiness. Carnelian, a red stone, may represent the fiery nature of God's judgment and His righteous wrath. Together, these stones convey the majesty and glory of God, emphasizing His divine nature and the awe-inspiring presence that John witnesses. This imagery aligns with other biblical descriptions of God's appearance, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26-28</a>, where God's glory is depicted with radiant colors.<p><b>and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne</b><br>The rainbow encircling the throne is reminiscent of the covenant God made with Noah in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13-17</a>, symbolizing God's mercy and faithfulness. The emerald color suggests a sense of peace and tranquility, contrasting with the fiery imagery of the stones. This combination of judgment and mercy reflects the dual aspects of God's character. The circular nature of the rainbow indicates completeness and eternity, reinforcing the idea of God's eternal covenant with His creation.

Just as Isaiah saw &#8220;the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), John witnesses the same sovereign Lord. He is not an abstract force; He is the living God whose rule is absolute (<a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Looked like jasper</b><p>Jasper in John&#8217;s day was a brilliantly clear or diamond-like stone, symbolizing purity and blazing holiness.

The comparison emphasizes literal, visible brilliance that overwhelms the senses, just as Ezekiel described &#8220;gleaming amber&#8221; around God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And carnelian</b><p>Carnelian (sardius) is deep red, recalling God&#8217;s justice and the price of redemption.

John earlier saw Jesus as &#8220;One like a son of man&#8221; whose eyes were &#8220;like blazing fire&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>), underscoring righteous judgment.

Ezekiel also saw &#8220;the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day&#8221; around God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>).

The sardian, or sardine, is admitted to be a stone of fiery red colour; the emerald, to which the bow round the throne is compared, is almost certainly a bright green; the hue of the jasper is the difficulty. The jasper--the last stone in the high-priest's breastplate, and first of the twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem (<a href="/exodus/28-20.htm" title="And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be set in gold in their settings.">Exodus 28:20</a>, and <a href="/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;">Revelation 21:19</a>)--is described by the best authorities as a dark, opaque green. Such a colour is quite in harmony with the colours of the other stones in the breastplate, and particularly with the foundation stones, which seem to be arranged in shades of colour (see Notes on <a href="/revelation/21-19.htm" title="And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;">Revelation 21:19</a> <span class= "ital">et seq</span>.); but the dark opaque green would be an ill combination with the red sardius and the green emerald in the vision of the present chapter. Is there no further light? We have a jasper stone spoken of in <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm" title="Having the glory of God: and her light was like to a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;">Revelation 21:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm" title="And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like to clear glass.">Revelation 21:18</a>, with the descriptive phrase, "clear as crystal!" Does not this point to a stone somewhat different in appearance from that spoken of simply as jasper? Such a clear crystal stone would be the most natural companion to the sardine, and the combination of the sparkling brightness and fiery red suits the union of brightness and flame which appears elsewhere in the Bible (comp, <a href="/revelation/1-14.htm" title="His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm" title="And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/8-2.htm" title="Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.">Ezekiel 8:2</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>), and is best understood of the holiness and righteousness of God. The latter half of this verse shows us these surrounded by the emerald-coloured bow, the evident symbol of the divine mercy. The allusion to the bow in the cloud (<a href="/context/genesis/9-12.htm" title="And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:">Genesis 9:12-16</a>) is obvious; the bow completely encircled the throne, as mercy encompassing judgment. It was a covenant token, bearing witness to God's faithfulness in dark times, God's care for the ark of His Church, and His mercy shining forth after storm. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that sat was to look upon like</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">he that sat like in appearance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>).

The jasper was the first, and the sardius the sixth of the foundations of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19, 20</a>). Much doubt is attached to the whole subject of the precious stones of the Bible. The modern jasper is opaque, while it is evident that the jasper of the Revelation is remarkable for its translucent character (see <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>, "jasper stone. clear as crystal;" 21:18, "The building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass"). It is evident that the stone was characterized by purity and brilliancy - features which seem to point it out as the modern diamond. The varying colour, which, according to some authorities, the jasper possessed, is not inconsistent with this view. It is curious, too, that in <a href="/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, which in the Authorized Version is rendered "diamond," is represented in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; while in ver. 20, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> the English "jasper," is <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">sardius</span> was the carnelian, always red, though somewhat varying in shade. The name has been variously derived from <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Persian <span class="accented">sered</span>, yellowish red; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Sardis, as the first place of its discovery; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while carnelian is connected with <span class="accented">carneus</span>, as being of the colour of raw flesh.
