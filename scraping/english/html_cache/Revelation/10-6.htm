This aligns with the prophetic urgency found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>, where the vision awaits its appointed time and will not delay.

God Himself once said, &#8220;By Myself I have sworn&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), showing that an oath is reserved for declarations God wants beyond all dispute.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Him who lives forever and ever</b><p>&#8226; The angel appeals to the eternal, self-existent God.

The visions of the first six trumpets have shown how, in the period of the world's existence, the ungodly do not escape judicial retribution. But that is not all; the force of the six judgments not having served to reduce the worldly to repentance, there can be no more delay, the last final judgment follows. But the last judgment, which follows quickly upon the other six (<a href="/revelation/11-14.htm">Revelation 11:14</a>), is for eternity (<a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>). The advent of this woe is, therefore, simultaneous with the end of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">"time,"</span> by which we signify that definite period, cut out of eternity, as it were, which is coeval with the existence of the world, and ceases with its destruction. The expression, therefore, implies, "The measure of God's punishments, viewed as opportunities for repentance, is exhausted; there is a limit to his endurance; the allotted time having been run, and his mercy to a large extent having been spurned, there is no more delay;" then falls the last final blow, which is at the end of "time," and at the beginning (for many) of eternity. Ebrard renders, "A space of time in which to repent" - a meaning compatible with the explanation given above. Others render, "The time of the fulfilment shall not be yet, but it shall be when the seventh trumpet sounds;" but this interpretation makes <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> equal <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.
