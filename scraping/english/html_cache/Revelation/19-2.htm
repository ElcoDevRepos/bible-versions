Throughout the Bible, God's character is consistently portrayed as just and true (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, <a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9</a>). In Revelation, this is a reassurance to believers that God's actions are based on His perfect justice. The context of Revelation is a time of final judgment, where God's truth prevails over deception and injustice. This aligns with the prophetic declarations in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where the Messiah judges with righteousness.<p><b>He has judged the great prostitute</b><br>The "great prostitute" is a symbolic representation of Babylon, often interpreted as a metaphor for a corrupt system or city that opposes God (<a href="/revelation/17.htm">Revelation 17:1-5</a>). Historically, Babylon was known for its wealth, idolatry, and immorality, making it a fitting symbol for any entity that leads people away from God. This judgment signifies the ultimate defeat of evil and corruption, fulfilling prophecies like those in <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7-8</a>, where Babylon's fall is foretold.<p><b>who corrupted the earth with her immorality.</b><br>This phrase highlights the global influence of the "great prostitute" in spreading immorality and idolatry. The corruption is not just local but affects the entire earth, indicating the pervasive nature of sin and rebellion against God. This echoes the warnings in the Old Testament about the dangers of idolatry and moral decay (<a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>). The imagery of corruption is also reminiscent of the days of Noah, where widespread immorality led to divine judgment (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-13</a>).<p><b>He has avenged the blood of His servants</b><br>God's vengeance is a recurring theme in Scripture, where He promises to avenge the wrongs done to His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). This phrase assures believers that God will not overlook the persecution and martyrdom of His servants. The avenging of blood is a fulfillment of the cries of the martyrs in <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9-10</a>, who ask how long until their blood is avenged. It underscores God's commitment to justice and His protection of His faithful ones.<p><b>that was poured out by her hand.</b><br>The imagery of blood being poured out signifies the violence and persecution inflicted by the "great prostitute" on God's people. This phrase connects to the historical persecution of Christians, both in the early church and throughout history. It also reflects the biblical principle that those who shed innocent blood will face divine retribution (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, <a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>). The phrase serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the ultimate vindication that comes from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate judge whose judgments are described as true and just.
