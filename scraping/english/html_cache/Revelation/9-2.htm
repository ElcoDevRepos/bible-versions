The "star" here is likely an angelic being given authority to open the Abyss, a term used to describe a deep, bottomless pit or a place of confinement for demonic forces. This aligns with other scriptural references to the Abyss as a place of imprisonment for evil spirits (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>, <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>). The act of opening the Abyss signifies a release of judgment or chaos upon the earth, consistent with apocalyptic themes throughout Revelation.<p><b>and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace</b><br>The imagery of smoke rising like a great furnace evokes scenes of destruction and judgment, reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>). Smoke is often associated with divine wrath and the presence of God in judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). This smoke symbolizes the release of evil and chaos, obscuring clarity and truth, and is a precursor to the plagues and torments described in the following verses.<p><b>and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit</b><br>The darkening of the sun and air signifies a significant disruption in the natural order, often used in prophetic literature to indicate divine judgment (<a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>, <a href="/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). Darkness is a common biblical metaphor for evil, ignorance, and separation from God (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>). This imagery underscores the severity of the judgment being unleashed, affecting both the physical and spiritual realms. The darkening also serves as a type of Christ's crucifixion, where darkness covered the land (<a href="/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>), symbolizing the weight of sin and judgment borne by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_abyss.htm">The Abyss</a></b><br>A deep, bottomless pit often associated with a place of confinement for demonic forces.

This star is best understood as a real, personal being&#8212;an angel entrusted with a key.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty is on display: the star &#8220;was given&#8221; the key, showing that even demonic realms operate under divine permission (cf. <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;Abyss&#8221; is a literal prison for fallen spirits (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; Jude 6). Its gates stay shut until God&#8217;s prophetic timetable calls for release.<p>&#8226; Opening the pit signals a fresh phase of God&#8217;s end-time judgments, moving from cosmic signs (<a href="/bsb/revelation/8.htm">Revelation 8</a>) to direct demonic torment (<a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace</b><p>&#8226; The description draws on vivid Old Testament imagery&#8212;Mount Sinai &#8220;was enveloped in smoke, because the LORD had descended on it in fire&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; In Sodom&#8217;s ruin, Abraham &#8220;looked out&#8230; and saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>). Such pictures communicate unbearable heat, choking fumes, and total devastation.<p>&#8226; Here the smoke is literal, yet it also signals the moral darkness that flows whenever hellish forces are unleashed (<a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The language assures believers that what lies beneath the earth&#8217;s surface is not myth; the Abyss is a real place with real consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit</b><p>&#8226; The smoke&#8217;s effect is global: sunlight and breathable air are both obscured. This echoes the ninth plague on Egypt, when &#8220;thick darkness&#8221; covered the land (<a href="/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets connect such darkening with the Day of the LORD: &#8220;The earth trembles, the heavens shake. The sun and moon grow dark&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/8-12.htm">Revelation 8:12</a> showed partial darkening; now the darkness intensifies as demonic powers ascend.<p>&#8226; Literal dimming of daylight serves as a divine megaphone, warning unbelievers while protecting the faithful&#8212;God still marks boundaries (<a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a> presents a literal moment in future history when an angel, under God&#8217;s authority, unlocks the Abyss. Real smoke billows out, mirroring the furnace-like judgments of the past and blanketing the planet in oppressive darkness. The scene underscores God&#8217;s total control over both heavenly and hellish realms, assuring believers that even the most frightening judgments advance His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And he opened . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, by reason of the smoke of the pit.</span> The first result of the opening of the pit is the diffusion of such a dense smoke that light and atmosphere are darkened. In the previous vision there was an obscuration of light arising from the smiting of the luminaries; in this the obscuration arises from causes external to the luminaries. In that the light-giving power was enfeebled; in this the light is not enfeebled, but hindered. This must be remembered. The interpretation of these visions is most difficult; but we must bear in mind that they are descriptive of that great war which the Church is waging with the world, which good is waging with evil, but the end of which, we are assured, is the victory of good. The kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of His Christ (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>); but during the progress of the war the issue will often appear doubtful: nay, even the triumph may seem to be in the hand of the enemy; but faith disregards the back-flowing waves, for she knows the tide is coming in. We have seen that the advance of Christianity is marked by the manifestation of evils as well as the establishment of good. Christianity does not create evils, but the very intense honesty of her principles reveals the hidden force of unsuspected corruption. Thus the faith of Christ is come to give light unto the world, but in her progress many lights fall--the false lights of world-power, world-wisdom, false religionism, and heresies. The enemy, too, is at work, and seeks to obscure her light by the diffusion of dark and low-born thoughts. The smoke of the pit blackens the light and confuses the atmosphere. Now, this obscuration is surely the diffusion on earth of evil thoughts and ideas, the spirit of falsehood and hate, hostility to truth, and enmity against God and man. The bright, clear air made gladsome by the sun is darkened; "all forms that once appeared beautiful become hideous."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he opened the bottomless pit;</span> <span class="accented">pit of the abyss</span>, as above. This phrase is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, Coptic, AEthiopic, and others. It is inserted by A, B, many cursives, Vulgate, Syriac, Andreas. <span class="cmt_word">And there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace.</span> The smoke of the incense (<a href="/revelation/8-4.htm">Revelation 8:4</a>) purified the prayers of the saints, making them acceptable before God; the smoke which ascends from the abyss clouds men's minds and darkens their understandings. <span class="cmt_word">And the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</span> The air, becoming filled with the smoke, obscured the light of the sun, so that both appeared dark. This darkening of the atmosphere may have been suggested by the description of the locust plague (<a href="/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>), or by the account in <a href="/joel/2.htm">Joel 2</a>. But it is the smoke, not the locusts, which is here said to cause the obscurity; the locusts issue forth out of the smoke. It is doubtful whether we ought to seek any particular interpretation of <span class="accented">the smoke</span>; it is probably only accessory to the general picture.
