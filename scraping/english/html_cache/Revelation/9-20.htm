These plagues are part of a series of divine judgments meant to lead humanity to repentance. The context is apocalyptic, with imagery that echoes the plagues of Egypt in Exodus, serving as a divine warning. The "rest of mankind" indicates a significant portion of humanity that remains after a period of intense suffering and death.<p><b>still did not repent of the works of their hands</b><br>Despite witnessing the severity of God's judgments, the survivors persist in their sinful behaviors. "The works of their hands" is a biblical idiom often used to describe idolatry and the creation of idols (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>). This phrase underscores the stubbornness and hardness of human hearts, a recurring theme in Scripture where people refuse to turn away from sin even in the face of divine intervention.<p><b>They did not stop worshiping demons</b><br>This highlights the spiritual blindness and deception prevalent among the people. Worshiping demons suggests a deeper spiritual rebellion against God, aligning with the forces of evil. In <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>, Paul warns that sacrifices to idols are, in fact, sacrifices to demons. This connection emphasizes the spiritual warfare aspect of idolatry and the influence of demonic forces in leading people away from God.<p><b>and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood</b><br>The mention of materials used for idols reflects the ancient practice of crafting physical representations of deities. These materials are often associated with wealth and status, indicating that idolatry is not only a spiritual issue but also tied to materialism and human pride. The prophets frequently condemned such practices (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-5</a>), highlighting the futility of worshiping man-made objects.<p><b>which cannot see or hear or walk</b><br>This phrase underscores the impotence and lifelessness of idols, contrasting them with the living God who sees, hears, and acts. The futility of idol worship is a common biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6-7</a>. These passages mock the idea that inanimate objects could possess divine attributes or offer any real help, emphasizing the foolishness of turning away from the true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mankind.htm">Mankind</a></b><br>Refers to the people on earth who survived the plagues described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/9.htm">Revelation 9</a>.

The verse warns that hard hearts can waste divine mercy, and it underscores the urgency of genuine repentance while time remains.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20, 21) <span class= "bld">And the rest . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the rest of mankind who were not slain in these plagues did not even repent of</span> (or, <span class= "ital">out of</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> so as to forsake) <span class= "ital">the works of their hands, that they should not worship the demons</span> (evil spirits), <span class= "ital">and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass</span>, <span class= "ital">and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk: and they did not repent of</span> (or, <span class= "ital">out of) their murders, nor of</span> (or, <span class= "ital">out of) their sorceries, nor out of their fornication, nor out of their thefts.</span> These verses make one or two points clear. First, they show us that, whatever the nature of the plagues might be, they were afflictions designed to bring about repentance, and to rouse men, whether nominally Christian or not, from the lethargy into which long indulged sin had plunged them. Those terrible revolutions which are the growth of years, and which startle men with their apparent suddenness and violence, are the great appeals of God, asking men to see the meaning of sin; they are the trumpet blasts calling to repentance. But we are told more; the remainder of the godless did not repent. We are not, indeed, told that they did not feel terror, or remorse, or momentary qualms and misgivings, but that they did not show that which alone is regarded as genuine repentance, the repentance out of sin, the repentance which turns away from sin. We need always that wholesome caution. We need it most in times when hysterical and emotional religionism is fashionable, and it is forgotten that true repentance is a repentance whereby we forsake sins. These men repented not out of their sin. And their sins are enumerated, and the enumeration again takes us back to the history of Israel as to the historical basis which the sacred seer enlarged and vivified; for the sins are just those against which Israel was warned and into which Israel fell (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-28.htm" title="And there you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.">Deuteronomy 4:28</a>; <a href="/context/psalms/106-34.htm" title="They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:">Psalm 106:34-40</a>; <a href="/acts/7-41.htm" title="And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.">Acts 7:41</a>). The sins are demon-worship and idolatry: "They served idols; they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils." (Comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>.) It is needful to trace these sins in the history of Israel, as it has been argued that these are heathen sins, and that therefore these plagues must be plagues which fall on those who are literally heathens. But if we bear in mind that the series of visions describe features which will accompany the advance of Christianity in the world, we shall remember that it is against worldliness, wherever found, idolatries, of whatever kind, murders and thefts, called by whatever name, that the true genius of Christianity makes war. Christ is king, and king of righteousness, and in righteousness does He make war, and the heathenisms which are called Christianity are as much the objects of His displeasure as the most obvious Paganism. It is needful to remember that Jews are addressed as if they were heathen, aye, very <span class= "ital">habitues</span> of Sodom (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:10</a>), and that the Christian Church is warned against sins which are little else than idolatries. Covetousness, the very essence of worldliness, is by St. Paul twice over called idolatry (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, and <a href="/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>). It seems, therefore, to be foreign to the purpose to try and limit these plagues only to the non-Christian world. To do this is to get a narrow, improbable (may we not say an impossible?) interpretation; for the greatest strength of the world-power would be left untouched. It is true that the visions are not showing us the plagues which fall on apostasy and fornication within the Church; but it is true that we are beholding visions which show how terribly the world-spirit avenges itself on all who harbour it, whether called Christian or not. Gross sins, gigantic frauds, complacent familiarity with crime, followed by blunted moral sense, are heathenish, whether found in Pagan or Christian society. Heavy woes must inevitably await the society which tolerates such works; but the worst omen of the coming doom is seen when society has lost the power to repent because it has lost the power to hate evil. Such an incapacity is invariably significant of advanced moral decay. It is the climax in the growth of sin which the Psalmist noticed where men lose the sacred abhorrence of evil (<a href="/psalms/36-4.htm" title="He devises mischief on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he abhors not evil.">Psalm 36:4</a>). To such repentance is becoming impossible. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues;</span> <span class="accented">the rest of mankind</span> (Revised Version). That is, the two thirds (ver. 18). Some understand "these plagues" to refer to the first six trumpets. It may be so, but it seems more correct to limit it to the sixth, as the same phrase, which occurs in ver. 18, must be so limited. <span class="accented">Mankind</span> must be taken to mean the worldly only. Of the ungodly, some are killed (the third part), the rest yet do not repent. The vision is not concerned with the fate of the righteous. <span class="cmt_word">Yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.</span> "The works of their hands" refers to idolatry, as shown by the succeeding words. This verse begins to prepare us for the seventh judgment. Men will not repent; therefore the last final judgment becomes necessary. The absurdity of idolatrous worship is frequently thus set forth by Old Testament writers (cf. <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/22-1.htm">Ezekiel 22:1, 4</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). See also the description in <a href="/daniel/5-23.htm">Daniel 5:23</a> which seems to have suggested the wording of this part of the vision. It has been well remarked that in this verse mention is made of sins against God; in the following verse man's sins against his neighbours are detailed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/9-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
