The imagery of the Lamb is rooted in the Passover lamb from <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, which was a type of Christ, symbolizing deliverance and protection through sacrifice. The blood of the Lamb signifies the atoning work of Christ on the cross, which provides redemption and victory over sin and evil. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>, where believers are described as being redeemed by the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.<p><b>and by the word of their testimony</b><br>The "word of their testimony" refers to the proclamation of faith and the personal witness of believers. This testimony is not just verbal but is demonstrated through a life transformed by the gospel. In the early church, testimony often led to persecution, yet it was a powerful tool for spreading the faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>, where the apostles gave powerful testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. The testimony of believers is a key element in spiritual warfare, as it declares the truth of Christ's victory and the believer's allegiance to Him.<p><b>And they did not love their lives so as to shy away from death</b><br>This phrase underscores the commitment and courage of believers who are willing to face persecution and even martyrdom for their faith. It reflects the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24-25</a>, where He calls His followers to deny themselves and take up their cross. The early Christians often faced severe persecution, as documented in historical accounts of the Roman Empire, where many were martyred for refusing to renounce their faith. This willingness to face death rather than compromise their testimony is a testament to their deep conviction and hope in the resurrection, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-21.htm">Philippians 1:21</a>, where Paul states, "For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_overcomers.htm">The Overcomers</a></b><br>These are the faithful believers who have triumphed over Satan.

Victory is anchored in what Jesus has done, expressed in what His people say, and proven by how they live&#8212;even when faithfulness costs everything.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And they</span> <span class= "bld">overcame him . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And they conquered him</span> (not "by," but) <span class= "ital">on account of the blood of the Lamb, and on account of the word of their testimony, </span>&c. They overcame him--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the accuser, the devil: their victory over him is "owing to" the blood of the Lamb. Who is he that condemneth, when Christ hath died? What power can the accusations of the adversary have when the Lamb of God hath taken away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>), and when we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus? (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,">Hebrews 10:19</a>.) Dean Alford mentions the tradition that Satan accuses men all days of the year except on the Day of Atonement. But their victory is also in virtue of the <span class= "ital">word of their testimony:</span> in virtue of the word to which they bore witness; not simply, I think, because they had a word of God to which they could bear witness, but because they had a word of God and did bear witness to it. The Christian victory is a victory of dependence and of obedience: of dependence on Him without whom they can do nothing; and of obedience to Him: it is in keeping of His commandments there is great reward: and in bearing testimony that the testimony becomes a power and a treasure. So it was the man who did Christ's commandments who was like the man whose house was founded on the rock. Theoretical religion relaxes the energy of faith, even though it may brace the intellect; practical religion invigorates faith, gives it its force, and moulds the heroism of those who, in their love of Christ, "love not their lives even unto death." It is thought that these last words imply that the martyred saints alone are spoken of. This seems to me a mistake. It is true that in the martyr we have the fullest practical token of <span class= "ital">that</span> spirit of devotion to Christ which loves Him more than life itself; but the spirit of such devotion and such love has breathed in thousands who have never died the martyr's death, but who have devoted their lives to Him they loved. The martyr spirit needs not death to show itself; many lose their lives for Christ's sake who have never been called to lay down their lives for Him, and these, as truly as those who have passed away in the shroud of flame, have loved not their lives unto the death. "He may bid us die for Him: He does bid us live for Him. If we do not the one--the less--we may be quite sure that we shall never rise to the other--the higher and the more glorious" (Dr. Vaughan).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they overcame him</span> (cf. the frequent references to those who overcome, and the promises made to them, <a href="/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a> , etc.). The reference "they" is to "our brethren," the accused ones of ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">By the blood of the Lamb;</span> <span class="accented">because of the blood</span>, etc. (Revised Version). That is, "the blood of the Lamb" is the ground or reason of their victory, not the instrument. So in <a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>, "1 John... was in the island called Patmos, <span class="accented">because of</span> the Word of God (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)" (cf. <a href="/revelation/6-9.htm">Revelation 6:9</a>). Winer agrees with this view of the present passage, against Ewald and De Wette (p. 498 of Moulton's translation). "The Lamb," who was seen "as it had been slain" (<a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) - Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And by the word of their testimony;</span> <span class="accented">and on account of the word, etc.</span> The one phrase is the natural complement of the other. "The blood of the Lamb" would have been shed in vain without the <span class="accented">testimony</span>, the outcome of the faith of his followers; that <span class="accented">testimony</span> would have been impossible without the shedding of the blood. <span class="cmt_word">And they loved not their lives unto the death;</span> <span class="accented">their life even unto death.</span> That is, they valued not their life in this world, even to the extent of meeting death for the sake of giving their testimony. There is no article in the Greek, merely <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; so also in the same phrase in <a href="/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>. The article of the Authorized Version in <a href="/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a> is probably derived from Wickliffe's Bible; that in the present passage, from Tyndale's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(autoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
