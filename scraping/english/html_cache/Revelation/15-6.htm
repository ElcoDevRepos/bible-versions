The number seven is significant in biblical literature, symbolizing completeness or perfection. The seven angels are messengers of God's final and complete judgment, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11), which were also acts of divine judgment. The temple here is likely the heavenly temple, as earthly temples would not be the source of such divine actions. This imagery connects to the broader theme of Revelation, where God's ultimate justice is executed.<p><b>dressed in clean and bright linen</b><br>The attire of the angels signifies purity and righteousness. Linen was a fabric often associated with priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39-42</a>), indicating a holy service. The brightness of the linen suggests the glory and holiness of God, reflecting the divine nature of their mission. This attire contrasts with the corruption and impurity of the world that is about to be judged, emphasizing the righteousness of God's actions.<p><b>and girded with golden sashes around their chests</b><br>Golden sashes are a symbol of authority and royalty. In ancient times, a sash was often worn by those in positions of power or honor. Gold, being a precious metal, further emphasizes the value and authority of the angels' mission. This imagery is reminiscent of the description of Jesus in <a href="/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>, where He is also described as wearing a golden sash, suggesting that the angels are acting under His authority and in His likeness. The chest, being the location of the sash, symbolizes the heart and the center of one's being, indicating that their mission is central to God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_angels.htm">Seven Angels</a></b><br>These are divine messengers tasked with executing God's judgment through the seven plagues.

It is well to remember this, for these plagues are not, like the judgments of the trumpet, calls to repentance; they are plagues on those who have refused to return, who have rejected the sanctuary, the tabernacle of witness, which the Lord pitched among men, and who have refused, like obstinate builders, the stone which has become the head of the corner. Out of the rejected temple the angels of wrath come; it is ever true that out of rejected mercies the heaviest of plagues are forged.

Instead of <span class= "ital">linen, </span>some MSS. have "a stone<span class= "ital">:"</span> the angels, according to this, were "clad in a stone, pure, brilliant." There is a parallel thought in Ezekiel, who describes the splendour of the King of Tyre: "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond," &c. (<a href="/ezekiel/28-13.htm" title="You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues;</span> <span class="accented">there came out the seven angels that had</span>, etc. These angels are distinguished from the other angels only by the fact that they bore the seven plagues.
