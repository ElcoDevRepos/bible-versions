Cinnamon and spice were highly valued for their rarity and use in perfumes and anointing oils. Incense and myrrh were used in religious rituals, symbolizing prayers rising to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). Frankincense, a gift brought to Jesus by the Magi (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>), signifies divinity and worship. The mention of these items highlights the material wealth and spiritual corruption of Babylon, representing a world system opposed to God.<p><b>of wine, olive oil, fine flour, and wheat;</b><br>These are staples of the Mediterranean diet, essential for daily life and religious offerings (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>). Wine and olive oil were symbols of joy and prosperity (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The abundance of these goods in Babylon signifies economic prosperity but also indulgence and excess. The reference to fine flour and wheat connects to the sustenance and basic needs of life, which Babylon exploited for luxury rather than sustenance.<p><b>of cattle, sheep, horses, and carriages;</b><br>These animals were crucial for agriculture, transportation, and trade. Cattle and sheep were used for sacrifices and food, while horses and carriages indicate military power and wealth. The accumulation of such resources in Babylon suggests a focus on earthly power and security, contrasting with reliance on God. The imagery may evoke the wealth of Solomon's kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>), which ultimately led to idolatry and division.<p><b>of bodies and souls of slaves.</b><br>This phrase underscores the dehumanizing aspect of Babylon's commerce, where people are reduced to commodities. The mention of both bodies and souls highlights the total exploitation and moral decay inherent in the system. Slavery was a common practice in the Roman Empire, and this critique aligns with biblical themes of liberation and justice (<a href="/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).
