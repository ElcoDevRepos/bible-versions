The "another angel" suggests a continuation of a series of angelic appearances, indicating the ongoing divine intervention in the events of the end times. Angels are often messengers of God, and their presence in Revelation underscores the heavenly authority behind the messages being delivered. The imagery of an angel "flying overhead" suggests a position of authority and visibility, emphasizing the importance and urgency of the message being proclaimed.<p><b>with the eternal gospel to proclaim</b><br>The "eternal gospel" refers to the unchanging and everlasting good news of salvation through Jesus Christ. This gospel is not limited by time or circumstance and remains relevant throughout all ages. The proclamation of the gospel by an angel highlights its divine origin and the importance of its message in the context of the end times. The use of "eternal" underscores the timeless nature of God's plan for humanity, which has been consistent from creation through to the end of the age.<p><b>to those who dwell on the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the intended audience of the angel's proclamation. "Those who dwell on the earth" often refers to humanity in general, particularly those who are living in opposition to God.

The message of the gospel is universal, intended for all people, regardless of their current spiritual state.<p><b>to every nation and tribe and tongue and people</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the universal scope of the gospel message. It is meant for all humanity, transcending ethnic, linguistic, and cultural barriers.
