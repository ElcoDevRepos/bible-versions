The use of pearls for the gates is unique and significant. In ancient times, pearls were considered extremely valuable and rare, symbolizing purity and beauty. This imagery suggests the immense value and purity of the New Jerusalem. The idea of gates made of pearls also reflects the parable of the pearl of great price (<a href="/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>), emphasizing the kingdom of heaven's incomparable worth.<p><b>with each gate consisting of a single pearl</b><br>The description of each gate being made from a single pearl highlights the miraculous and divine nature of the New Jerusalem. In the natural world, pearls of such size do not exist, indicating that this is a supernatural creation. This imagery may also symbolize the unity and perfection of God's creation, as well as the singularity of Christ as the way to enter the kingdom of heaven (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The singular pearl could also represent the unity of believers entering through Christ, the one true gate.<p><b>The main street of the city was pure gold</b><br>Gold is often associated with divinity, kingship, and purity in the Bible. The use of pure gold for the main street signifies the holiness and majesty of the New Jerusalem. In ancient cultures, gold was the most precious metal, often used in the construction of temples and palaces, symbolizing wealth and splendor. The purity of the gold indicates the absence of impurity or sin, reflecting the perfect nature of the heavenly city. This imagery connects to the streets of gold mentioned in <a href="/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>, emphasizing the city's divine origin and eternal value.<p><b>as clear as glass</b><br>The description of gold being as clear as glass suggests a level of purity and transparency beyond earthly experience. In biblical symbolism, glass often represents clarity and truth. This imagery may indicate the complete transparency and righteousness of the New Jerusalem, where nothing is hidden, and all is revealed in the light of God's glory. The clarity of the gold also reflects the purity and holiness of God's presence, as seen in <a href="/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>, where there is no need for the sun or moon because God's glory illuminates the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_jerusalem.htm">The New Jerusalem</a></b><br>This is the heavenly city described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, representing the eternal dwelling place of God with His people.

By calling them &#8220;twelve pearls,&#8221; Scripture highlights both perfect symmetry (twelve is the number of governmental completeness) and extraordinary beauty.<p>&#8226; Pearls are formed through suffering and patience inside an oyster; the image recalls how God&#8217;s kingdom comes through Christ&#8217;s sacrifice and the perseverance of His people (compare <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>, where the &#8220;pearl of great value&#8221; represents the kingdom).<p>&#8226; Unlike earthly fortifications of stone and iron, gates of pearl speak of purity and peace. No enemy ever enters this city (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>); the gates are always open (21:25), signaling complete security in God&#8217;s presence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With each gate consisting of a single pearl</b><p>&#8226; Each gate is not made from many pearls but from one seamless pearl, emphasizing the unity of God&#8217;s salvation plan&#8212;there is &#8220;one way&#8221; to enter, and that way is Christ (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>).<p>&#8226; A single immense pearl would be humanly impossible to fashion, pointing to God&#8217;s creative power and the literal, supernatural nature of the eternal city (<a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The individuality of each pearl-gate also underlines personal access; every believer will walk through a gate that proclaims, &#8220;Your entrance cost Heaven dearly, yet it stands eternally secure.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The main street of the city was pure gold</b><p>&#8226; Gold throughout Scripture pictures deity and glory (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>).

All life in the city revolves around God Himself.<p>&#8226; The description fulfills God&#8217;s promise to &#8220;make a place&#8221; for His people that far exceeds all earthly riches (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>; <a href="/haggai/2-8.htm">Haggai 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As clear as glass</b><p>&#8226; Gold so refined that it is transparent speaks of absolute purity&#8212;nothing opaque, hidden, or corrupt remains (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<p>&#8226; This transparency mirrors the sea of glass before God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>), linking the throne room vision to the final city; Heaven&#8217;s holiness now fills every corner of human habitation.<p>&#8226; Light in the city comes from the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>); transparent gold allows that light to permeate everything, symbolizing unbroken fellowship and perfect insight (<a href="/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/21-21.htm">Revelation 21:21</a> paints a literal, breathtaking picture of the New Jerusalem: gates that are single, perfect pearls reflecting the costly grace of entry; a central street of transparent gold radiating God&#8217;s glory; and an environment of flawless purity where nothing hinders communion with the Lord. The verse assures believers that the coming Kingdom is both magnificently real and eternally secure, inviting us even now to value Christ above all and walk in the light that will one day fill every street of the Father&#8217;s house.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And the twelve gates . . .</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">gate-towers.</span> Each gate was of one pearl--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>made out of one pearl.

The pearl was esteemed of the greatest value among the ancients; it is an appropriate emblem of the highest truth, and so of Him who is the Truth as well as the Way of Life. Lord Bacon compared truth to a pearl "that showeth best by day." Another feature may be added. It is <span class= "ital">the </span>only precious stone which the art and skill of man cannot improve.
