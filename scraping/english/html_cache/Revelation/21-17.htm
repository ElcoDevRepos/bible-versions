In the context of Revelation, measuring the wall of the New Jerusalem symbolizes God's precise and perfect design for His eternal city. This echoes the measuring of the temple in <a href="/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-42</a>, where the prophet is given a vision of a future temple, emphasizing God's meticulous planning and the sanctity of His dwelling place.<p><b>to be 144 cubits</b><br>The number 144 is significant as it is the product of 12 times 12, which in biblical numerology represents completeness and perfection. The number 12 is often associated with the people of God, as seen in the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles. Thus, 144 cubits may symbolize the complete and perfect protection and security of God's people within the New Jerusalem. A cubit, an ancient unit of measure, is approximately 18 inches or 45 centimeters, making the wall about 216 feet or 66 meters high, indicating a substantial and formidable barrier.<p><b>by the human measure</b><br>This phrase indicates that the measurement is understandable and relatable to human standards, emphasizing the tangible reality of the New Jerusalem. It reassures believers that the promises of God are not abstract or mystical but are grounded in reality and can be comprehended by human understanding. This aligns with the incarnation of Christ, where the divine took on human form to be relatable and accessible.<p><b>the angel was using</b><br>The involvement of an angel in the measurement process underscores the divine authority and heavenly origin of the vision. Angels often serve as messengers or agents of God's will throughout Scripture, as seen in the announcements to Mary in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> and to the shepherds in <a href="/luke/2.htm">Luke 2</a>. The angel's role here highlights the divine endorsement and authenticity of the vision John receives, assuring believers of the certainty and truth of God's promises for the future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>The angel is the one measuring the wall of the New Jerusalem.
