In the context of Revelation, these kings symbolize rulers or leaders who align themselves with the beast, representing a coalition of power against God. The singular "one purpose" indicates a unified agenda, suggesting a concerted effort to oppose God's kingdom. This unity among the kings can be seen as a reflection of the end-times rebellion against divine authority, echoing the Tower of Babel's unified defiance (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>).<p><b>to yield their power and authority:</b><br>The act of yielding power and authority signifies a voluntary submission or transfer of control. In the biblical context, this reflects a significant decision by these rulers to align with the beast, representing a satanic or anti-Christ figure. This transfer of power is reminiscent of the way earthly kingdoms often submit to greater powers for strategic alliances, as seen in historical empires. Theologically, it underscores the theme of human authority being misused in opposition to God's sovereign rule, as seen in the temptation of Christ where Satan offers Him the kingdoms of the world (<a href="/matthew/4-8.htm">Matthew 4:8-9</a>).<p><b>to the beast:</b><br>The "beast" is a central figure in Revelation, often interpreted as a representation of the Antichrist or a system of government opposed to God. This imagery draws from Daniel's visions of beasts representing empires (Daniel 7). The beast's role in Revelation is to lead a final rebellion against God, gathering earthly powers to wage war against the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>). Theologically, the beast serves as a counterfeit to Christ, offering a false sense of security and power, ultimately leading to destruction. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of the conflict between God's kingdom and the forces of evil, culminating in the ultimate victory of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kings.htm">The Kings</a></b><br>These are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.
