The smoke symbolizes a spiritual darkness or deception, often associated with judgment or the presence of evil. In biblical context, smoke is frequently linked to divine wrath or the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. Here, however, it suggests a malevolent force being unleashed upon the earth.<p><b>locusts descended on the earth</b><br>Locusts in the Bible are often symbols of destruction and judgment, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>) and the prophecy of Joel (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>). These locusts are not ordinary insects but are part of a divine judgment, representing a spiritual or demonic force. The imagery of locusts would have been particularly vivid to ancient readers familiar with the devastation caused by locust swarms in the Middle East.<p><b>and they were given power</b><br>The phrase indicates that the locusts' ability to harm is not inherent but granted. This suggests divine sovereignty, as God allows these creatures to execute judgment. It reflects the biblical theme that even forces of evil operate under God's ultimate control, as seen in <a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>, where Satan is permitted to test Job but within limits set by God.<p><b>like that of the scorpions of the earth</b><br>Scorpions are known for their painful sting, symbolizing torment and suffering. In the ancient Near East, scorpions were feared for their venomous sting, which could cause intense pain and even death. The comparison to scorpions emphasizes the severity and intensity of the judgment these locusts bring. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to scorpions as symbols of danger and suffering, such as in <a href="/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving authority over scorpions, symbolizing spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/locusts.htm">Locusts</a></b><br>Symbolic creatures that emerge from the smoke, representing a form of divine judgment.

That smoke is literal, yet it also signals the release of something far worse than pollution: demonic forces long confined (<a href="/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). As with the &#8220;smoke of the land going up like the smoke of a furnace&#8221; after Sodom&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/genesis/19-28.htm">Genesis 19:28</a>), the picture is one of divine wrath breaking into the natural order. God allows the darkness, but He still controls its timing and extent (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>locusts descended on the earth</b><p>These are not ordinary insects. Scripture later describes them with crowns, faces like men, hair like women, and breastplates of iron (<a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7&#8211;9</a>). So, while John calls them &#8220;locusts,&#8221; their true identity is a horde of visible, invading demons.<p>&#8226; Past plagues of literal locusts previewed this judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>); those infestations devoured crops&#8212;these devour peace of mind.<p>&#8226; Their descent &#8220;upon the earth&#8221; means a worldwide reach, fulfilling the warning cry of &#8220;woe to those who dwell on the earth&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/8-13.htm">Revelation 8:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God often uses what people already know (locust plagues) to help them grasp what is coming (<a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they were given power</b><p>&#8220;Given&#8221; points to delegated authority. The locust-demons possess no autonomous right to torment; they operate only under limits set by the Lord (<a href="/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Duration: five months (<a href="/revelation/9-5.htm">Revelation 9:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Target: only those without God&#8217;s seal (<a href="/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Result: agony so intense people long to die, yet cannot (<a href="/revelation/9-6.htm">Revelation 9:6</a>).<p>Satan rages, but God remains sovereign (<a href="/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a>; <a href="/job/2-6.htm">Job 2:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like that of the scorpions of the earth</b><p>The comparison pinpoints the nature of the pain. A scorpion&#8217;s sting produces burning, throbbing torment without immediate death&#8212;exactly what these creatures inflict. Jesus used the same image when promising His disciples authority &#8220;to tread on serpents and scorpions&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>), underscoring that even this terror is subject to divine oversight. Old Testament warnings about scorpions in the wilderness (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>) echo the idea of disciplined chastening: the goal is repentance before final judgment falls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/9-3.htm">Revelation 9:3</a> presents a literal, future release of demonic locusts from the smoke of the opened abyss. Their worldwide descent, God-given power, and scorpion-like sting form a controlled judgment aimed at an unrepentant earth. Even in this horrifying scene, Scripture showcases God&#8217;s authority: He opens the pit, sets the limits, and uses the torment to call humanity back to Himself before His wrath reaches its climax.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And there came . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">And out of the smoke there came forth locusts upon the earth; and there was given to them power, as the scorpions of the earth</span> (? land-scorpions) <span class= "ital">have power.</span> The outcome of the gloom is the power of devastation and pain. We still have reference to the Egyptian plagues--this time to the locusts (<a href="/context/exodus/10-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.">Exodus 10:12-15</a>): "They covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened." Similarly, Joel describes the darkening of the land through the plague of locusts (<a href="/context/joel/2-3.htm" title="A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them.">Joel 2:3-10</a>): "The sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining." But the locusts of our vision are armed with the power of scorpions, to sting and to torture (<a href="/revelation/9-5.htm" title="And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he strikes a man.">Revelation 9:5</a>): the scorpions are called scorpions of the earth. Some have thought that this expression is equivalent to land-scorpions, in contradistinction from so-called sea-scorpions. This hardly seems likely or necessary. Their power to torment men is the prominent idea. The locusts are not literal locusts: this scorpion- like power given to them is enough to convince us of this, even it the next verse did not clearly show it. The scorpion-like power seems to depict a malicious energy, as the locusts depict a devastating multitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth.</span> The <span class="accented">locust</span> is constantly referred to in the Bible, and various illustrations are drawn from their characteristic features. In the East they appear in great numbers and men are helpless against their devastating power. Sometimes an attempt is made to check their progress by lighting fires, and this practice may have suggested the above description of the locusts proceeding from the smoke. The irresistible destruction which they cause is alluded to in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>; <a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13</a>; their number in <a href="/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15</a>. The air is sometimes tainted with their dead bodies (<a href="/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>). The natural features of the locust are fully dwelt upon in vers. 7-10. As an illustration, we may quote Niebuhr, who gives an Arab's description of the locust: "In head like the horse, in breast like the lion, in feet like the camel, in body like the serpent, in tail like the scorpion, in antennae like a virgin's hair." Three out of these five points of resemblance are mentioned in vers. 7-10. The <span class="accented">locusts</span> here symbolize heretics and infidels. Some writers (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Wordsworth) apply the symbol to the Mohammedans (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, where the parallel is very fully worked out). But though this may be, and probably is, a fulfilment of the vision, it would be wrong to thus restrict our interpretation. Scarcely any one cause has contributed more to the trouble and destruction of men than the violence which is the result of religious hatred. Whether it be the heathen idolater, the warlike Mohammedan, or the Christian bigot, who is the agent, the effect is the same. It may be said, too, that if the minds of Christians also had not been darkened by the prejudicial influence of Satan, who is the cause of their unhappy divisions, heresies, and apostasies, these troubles could scarcely have fallen upon mankind. The innumerable occasions of such violence may be well illustrated by the countless number of the locusts; and the effect lives after the death of the authors, tainting the moral atmosphere. It is true that the true Christian sometimes suffers also; but tidal is an aspect which is set forth in the visions of the seals. Here another view is set forth, namely, that the ungodly are themselves punished, and punished severely, by means of this evil influence of the devil.
