In biblical context, washing robes is symbolic of cleansing from sin, often associated with the blood of Christ (<a href="/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). The imagery of washing robes is rooted in the Old Testament, where priests were required to wash before entering the temple (<a href="/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20-21</a>). This act represents the sanctification necessary to stand before God. The blessing pronounced here echoes the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, emphasizing the spiritual state of those who are cleansed.<p><b>so that they may have the right to the tree of life</b><br>The tree of life is a symbol of eternal life and divine provision, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a> in the Garden of Eden. Access to the tree of life signifies restoration to the original state of communion with God, lost through sin. In Revelation, the tree of life reappears as a promise of eternal life for the redeemed (<a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). This connection underscores the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan, where believers are granted the right to eternal life through Christ's atonement.<p><b>and may enter the city by its gates</b><br>The city refers to the New Jerusalem, described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a> as the ultimate dwelling place of God with His people. Entering by the gates implies legitimate access and acceptance into God's eternal kingdom. In ancient cities, gates were places of authority and judgment, where entry was controlled (<a href="/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3:1-32</a>). This imagery highlights the security and exclusivity of the New Jerusalem, where only those who are redeemed and purified may enter. The gates symbolize the openness of God's invitation to those who are faithful, contrasting with the exclusion of the unrighteous (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_who_wash_their_robes.htm">Those who wash their robes</a></b><br>This phrase refers to believers who have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ, symbolizing purity and righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_life.htm">The Tree of Life</a></b><br>A symbol of eternal life and divine provision, originally found in the Garden of Eden and now in the New Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>Refers to the New Jerusalem, the eternal dwelling place of God with His people, described in <a href="/bsb/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing_of_purity.htm">The Blessing of Purity</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of spiritual purity and righteousness, which comes through faith in Jesus Christ and His atoning work.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/access_to_eternal_life.htm">Access to Eternal Life</a></b><br>Highlight the promise of eternal life for those who are in Christ, symbolized by the right to the Tree of Life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/entering_the_new_jerusalem.htm">Entering the New Jerusalem</a></b><br>Encourage believers to live with the hope and assurance of entering the New Jerusalem, motivating holy living and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_christ's_sacrifice.htm">The Role of Christ's Sacrifice</a></b><br>Reflect on the necessity of Christ's sacrifice for the cleansing of sin, which grants believers access to God's eternal promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Revelation_22_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Revelation 22:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_cleanse_to_enter_the_gates.htm">How can we "wash their robes" to enter the city gates today?

The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin: the best who have striven and conquered were victors not by their own might, but by the blood of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/12-11.htm" title="And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives to the death.">Revelation 12:11</a>).
