The "great and small" suggests that both influential figures and ordinary individuals are subject to the same divine scrutiny. This scene is set before the throne of God, symbolizing His ultimate authority and justice. The imagery of standing before the throne is reminiscent of courtroom settings, where individuals await judgment. This aligns with <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>, where thrones are set in place and books are opened for judgment.<p><b>And books were opened,</b><br>The opening of books signifies the revelation of deeds and the transparency of divine judgment. In ancient times, records were meticulously kept on scrolls or tablets, and this imagery suggests a comprehensive account of human actions. The concept of books being opened is also found in <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, where the court is seated, and books are opened, indicating a formal process of judgment.<p><b>and one of them was the Book of Life.</b><br>The Book of Life is a recurring biblical motif representing those who are granted eternal life. It is mentioned in several scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a> and <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>, as a register of the righteous. The presence of the Book of Life among the other books underscores the distinction between those who are saved and those who are not. This book is crucial for determining one's eternal destiny, as only those whose names are written in it are granted access to the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<p><b>And the dead were judged according to their deeds,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the principle of divine justice based on individual actions. While salvation is by grace through faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>), deeds are evidence of one's faith and relationship with God. The judgment according to deeds is consistent with other biblical teachings, such as <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, which states that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." This judgment is not about earning salvation but about the accountability of one's life choices.<p><b>as recorded in the books.</b><br>The recording of deeds in books suggests a meticulous and fair process of judgment. This imagery assures that nothing is overlooked or forgotten, reinforcing the idea of God's omniscience and justice. The concept of recorded deeds is also seen in <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, where a scroll of remembrance is written concerning those who fear the Lord. This assures believers that their faithfulness is noted and will be rewarded in the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dead.htm">The Dead</a></b><br>Refers to all people who have died, regardless of their status or achievements in life.

Heaven&#8217;s record books are opened to display every deed, while the Book of Life confirms who belongs to the Savior. Those without their names in that book face judgment on the basis of works that can never meet God&#8217;s holy standard. The passage assures us of God&#8217;s absolute justice and underscores the urgency of embracing Christ now, so that our names are found in the Book of Life when this day arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12, 13) <span class= "bld">And I saw the dead, small and great . . .</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before</span> (not "God," as in text, but) <span class= "ital">the throne, and books</span> (or, <span class= "ital">rolls</span>)<span class= "ital"> were opened; and another book</span> (or, <span class= "ital">roll</span>)<span class= "ital"> was opened, which is </span>(<span class= "ital">the book</span>)<span class= "ital"> of life; and the dead were judged out of the things which had been written in the books</span> (or, <span class= "ital">rolls</span>)<span class= "ital"> according to their works. And the sea gave forth the dead that were in it; and death and Hades gave forth the dead who were in them; and they were judged each according to their works.</span> The latter of these verses is added to assure us that the dead, in whatever quarter, must appear before the judgment throne. Death and Hades--"the grave world," and "the great watery grave"--the sea, "the universal hidden region of the dead," give up its prey; for there is One who sits upon the throne who has the keys of death and Hades (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm" title="I am he that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever more, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.">Revelation 1:18</a>). It has been said by some that the dead here spoken of as coming forth from the grave are not all the dead, but only "the rest of the dead" mentioned in <a href="/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.">Revelation 20:5</a>. Those who believe that the first resurrection there mentioned is a literal physical resurrection are compelled to limit the resurrection here to the resurrection only of the remainder of the dead. But the verses before us suggest no limitation, and the language most assuredly tends to the idea that saints and faithful servants of God take part in this later resurrection. If all the saints and righteous men of old are raised prior to the millennium, and take no part in this last judgment scene, then only the faithless and wicked are left to be judged before the great white throne, and as none of these can be found written in the book of life, the bringing forth of that book becomes meaningless. This is one result of vicious literalism of interpretations. The real significance of the scene lies in the vivid picturing of that great and solemn truth that we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, and that before Him there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed (<a href="/matthew/10-26.htm" title="Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.">Matthew 10:26</a>; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>). Then shall every human life appear in its true light. stripped of all the deceptive adornments which have given a fictitious respectability to ingenious fraud, and a fatal popularity to adroit wickedness and splendid vice. Then shall men be judged, not by rank, or success, or achievement, but according to their works, as it is twice stated here, and according to whether they have any life towards God. The works and the life towards God must be combined. A man may have, from the activities of his Christian works, a name to live, and yet be dead: the life-book and the workbook combine to mark the real servant of Christ. If he labours more abundantly than all, it is Christ who works in him, for his life is a life by the faith of the Son of God. (Comp. <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="/context/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14-26</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I saw</span> (see on ver. 11) <span class="cmt_word">the dead, small and great, stand before God;</span> <span class="accented">the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne.</span> All the dead, good and bad, as in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-33</a>. This is the general resurrection; what St. John might have called the second resurrection, with regard to the godly, who have once before risen to a life with Christ (see on ver. 5). Now, those who would not voluntarily share in the first resurrection are compelled to share in the second. <span class="cmt_word">And the books were opened.</span> Omit the article (cf. the description in <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And another book was opened, which is the book of life.</span> This book has been frequently referred to (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>).
