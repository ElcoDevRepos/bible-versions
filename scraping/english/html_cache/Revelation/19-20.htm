This captures the culmination of God's judgment against evil forces. The capture signifies the end of the beast's reign and the triumph of divine justice. This event is part of the eschatological narrative where God asserts His ultimate authority over all creation.<p><b>along with the false prophet</b><br>The "false prophet" is introduced in <a href="/revelation/13-11.htm">Revelation 13:11-18</a> as the second beast, representing religious deception and false teachings that support the first beast. This figure is responsible for leading people astray through miraculous signs. The capture of both the beast and the false prophet indicates the dismantling of both political and religious systems that oppose God.<p><b>who on its behalf had performed signs</b><br>The false prophet performs miraculous signs to legitimize the authority of the beast, reminiscent of the magicians in Pharaoh's court (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>). These signs are deceptive, intended to mimic divine miracles and lead people away from the truth. This highlights the theme of spiritual warfare and the battle between truth and deception.<p><b>deceiving those who had the mark of the beast</b><br>The "mark of the beast" is a symbol of allegiance to the beast, contrasting with the seal of God on His followers (<a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>). Those who accept this mark are deceived into worshiping the beast, illustrating the consequences of choosing worldly power over divine truth. This deception fulfills the warnings given in passages like <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9-12</a> about the coming of lawlessness and deception.<p><b>and worshiped its image</b><br>Worshiping the image of the beast signifies idolatry and the ultimate rejection of God. This act of worship is a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The image represents the false ideologies and systems that demand loyalty and worship, drawing parallels to <a href="/daniel/3.htm">Daniel 3</a> where Nebuchadnezzar's image was worshiped.<p><b>Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur</b><br>The "fiery lake of burning sulfur" is a depiction of eternal judgment and separation from God, often associated with hell. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references to divine judgment, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). The fact that they are thrown alive emphasizes the immediacy and severity of their punishment, underscoring the finality of God's judgment against evil. This event foreshadows the ultimate defeat of Satan and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_beast.htm">The Beast</a></b><br>Represents a powerful, evil entity or system opposed to God, often interpreted as a political or religious power that leads people away from true worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_false_prophet.htm">The False Prophet</a></b><br>A figure who supports the beast by performing deceptive signs and wonders, leading people to worship the beast and receive its mark.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mark_of_the_beast.htm">The Mark of the Beast</a></b><br>A symbolic mark representing allegiance to the beast, often interpreted as a sign of loyalty to worldly systems opposed to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fiery_lake_of_burning_sulfur.htm">The Fiery Lake of Burning Sulfur</a></b><br>A place of final judgment and eternal punishment for the beast, the false prophet, and those who follow them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deception_through_signs.htm">Deception through Signs</a></b><br>The false prophet uses miraculous signs to deceive people, highlighting the danger of relying on signs and wonders without discernment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_the_last_days.htm">Discernment in the Last Days</a></b><br>Believers must cultivate spiritual discernment to recognize and resist deception, especially when it comes in the form of miraculous signs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/allegiance_to_christ.htm">Allegiance to Christ</a></b><br>The mark of the beast symbolizes allegiance to worldly powers;

Here we have described the destruction of the earthly manifestations of Satan's power; the means by which he seeks to achieve his purposes, and which we have interpreted as the hostile world power and self deception (see on Revelation 13.). The whole account contained in vers. 11-21 is a brief recapitulation of the whole period of warfare between Christ and Satan, with special attention given to the final overthrow of the powers of evil. It, therefore, covers the same ground as the vision of seals, and then that of the trumpets, then that of the vials, and afterwards that of the beasts, each occupies. The chief difference is that in all those visions the everyday conflict is more particularly described; whereas in this passage the termination of the conflict is specially brought before us. The same ground is covered in the next chapter, advancing, however, one step further, and showing us the final punishment of Satan himself, as well as of his instruments (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone;</span> <span class="accented">they twain were cast alive into the lake</span>, etc. (On "brimstone," etc., see on Revelation 9:17, 18.
