The earth helping the woman signifies divine intervention and protection. This imagery echoes the Old Testament, where the earth often plays a role in God's deliverance of His people, such as in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>, where the earth opened to swallow Korah and his followers. This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to use it to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and opened its mouth</b><br>The earth opening its mouth is a vivid metaphor for divine intervention. In biblical literature, the earth is sometimes personified to act on God's behalf. This imagery can be seen in the story of the Exodus, where the Red Sea parts to allow the Israelites to escape from Pharaoh's army (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>). The opening of the earth's mouth here suggests a miraculous event, underscoring the theme of God's protection and deliverance.<p><b>to swallow up the river</b><br>The river symbolizes the flood of persecution or evil that the dragon, representing Satan, unleashes against the woman. In biblical symbolism, water can represent chaos, danger, or overwhelming circumstances (<a href="/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69:1-2</a>). The act of the earth swallowing the river indicates a divine intervention that neutralizes the threat, reminiscent of how God often turns the plans of the wicked back upon themselves (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>).<p><b>that the dragon had poured from his mouth</b><br>The dragon is a symbol of Satan, the adversary of God's people. The imagery of the dragon pouring a river from its mouth suggests a powerful and destructive force, akin to lies, deception, or persecution. This aligns with Satan's role as the accuser and deceiver (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, <a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9-10</a>). The dragon's attempt to destroy the woman reflects the ongoing spiritual warfare between good and evil, a central theme in Revelation. The ultimate failure of the dragon's efforts highlights the assurance of God's victory over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Symbolically represents God's people, often interpreted as Israel or the Church.

The psalmist speaks figuratively, but Revelation pictures an event where the literal earth neutralizes a literal flood.<p>&#8226; Whether God causes a sudden chasm, a landslide, or another seismic event, the effect is unmistakable: the torrent meant for destruction disappears. Creation obeys its Maker (<a href="/job/37-5.htm">Job 37:5&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That the dragon had poured from his mouth</b><p>&#8220; that the dragon had poured from his mouth &#8221; identifies both the source and the motive behind the flood.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;dragon&#8221; is unambiguously &#8220;that ancient serpent called the devil and Satan&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>).

God&#8217;s immediate counteraction proves Satan can only rage within divinely set limits (<a href="/job/1-12.htm">Job 1:12</a>; <a href="/luke/22-31.htm">Luke 22:31&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/revelation/12-16.htm">Revelation 12:16</a> shows God turning the very ground beneath creation into a shield for His covenant people. Satan&#8217;s flood&#8212;whether water or armies&#8212;cannot reach its mark because the earth itself, under God&#8217;s command, swallows it. The scene mirrors earlier rescues (<a href="/bsb/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; <a href="/bsb/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>), reinforcing that in the last days, as always, the Lord keeps Israel and all who trust Him safe until His redemptive plan is complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/revelation/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And the earth . . .</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and drank up the river, &c.</span> This is generally understood of some earthly power which is raised up to protect the Church against persecution. Just as Persia was raised up to aid Israel after they had been swept away by the flood of Babylonish conquest, so does help come to the persecuted Church through the cultured Roman world, or through some other worldly power, "barbarian and godless in its beginning, but destined in due time to embrace, in name at least, the faith once abhorred, and to introduce that new order of things which should make a nominal Christianity the religion of states and nations, and secure it for ever against the risk of a repetition of bygone persecutions" (Dr. Vaughan). The passage seems to want a wider interpretation. By the flood or river we understand all great popular movements against Christianity: the earth swallows up these; they diffuse themselves for a time, but mother earth absorbs them all, for the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, and no movement hostile to truth can permanently succeed: the eternal laws of truth and right are ultimately found stronger than all the half truths, whole falsehoods, and selfishness which give force to such movements. In a mysterious way, every devil-born flood of opinion, or violence, or sentiment, will sink beneath the surface; they rise like a river, they are tasted, and then rejected. The laws of the earth are against their permanent success. The finest epic of the world might have for its motto: "The earth helped the woman." Creation is ultimately a witness for righteousness and truth. It is not one nation, one age, which is represented here; it is an eternal law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth;</span> <span class="accented">swallowed up the river</span> (Revised Version). "The earth" frequently, but not invariably, in the Revelation signifies "the wicked." It is doubtful, therefore, how far the figure here employed should be pressed. What is certain is that the writer intends to express the idea that the Church is preserved in a wonderful and even miraculous way from the efforts of the devil. Further than this we cannot proceed safely. Possibly we may see in the passage an allusion to the world embracing Christianity, by which the instrument of Satan's ill will became a defence to the Church; though an earlier period and earlier deliverances seem more likely to be intended (such as the conversion of St. Paul); for after endeavouring to destroy the woman at one stroke, the dragon proceeds to war with her seed. The words recall another incident in the history of the Israelitish flight from Egypt and sojourn in the wilderness, viz. that of the destruction of Korah and his company; though, of course, the nature of the incidents is not the same in both cases. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/revelation/12-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[But]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
