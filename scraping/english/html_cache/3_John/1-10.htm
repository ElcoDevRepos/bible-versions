The phrase "if I come" indicates John's intention to visit and personally address the situation, reflecting the apostolic authority he holds. The term "malicious slander" suggests that Diotrephes is spreading false and harmful statements, which is a serious offense in the Christian community. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, where sowing discord among brethren is listed as something God hates. The early church faced many challenges, including false teachings and internal strife, and John's role as an apostle was to maintain doctrinal purity and unity.<p><b>And unsatisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers</b><br>Diotrephes' refusal to welcome the brothers, likely itinerant preachers or missionaries, goes against the early Christian practice of hospitality, which was crucial for the spread of the Gospel. Hospitality is emphasized in passages like <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> and <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>, where believers are encouraged to show love and support to fellow Christians. This refusal indicates a lack of love and a breach of the communal values that were foundational to the early church. It also reflects a power struggle, as Diotrephes seeks to control who is allowed to participate in the community.<p><b>and forbids those who want to do so,</b><br>Diotrephes not only refuses hospitality himself but also prevents others from showing it. This authoritarian behavior disrupts the unity and fellowship of the church. It highlights the danger of leaders who prioritize personal power over the well-being of the community. This action is contrary to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized servant leadership (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>). The early church was built on mutual support and encouragement, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42-47</a>, and Diotrephes' actions undermine this foundation.<p><b>even putting them out of the church.</b><br>Excommunicating those who wish to show hospitality is an extreme measure that reveals the extent of Diotrephes' control and the severity of the situation. This act of putting people out of the church is reminiscent of the Pharisees' actions in <a href="/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a>, where fear of being expelled from the synagogue kept people from confessing Jesus as the Christ. It underscores the importance of church discipline being exercised with love and truth, as outlined in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>.

A heart closed to fellow Christians is a heart closed to Christ Himself (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And forbids those who want to do so</b><p>It is one thing to sin personally; it is worse to pressure others into the same sin (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>; <a href="/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). Diotrephes uses his influence to:<p>&#8226; Intimidate willing hosts.<p>&#8226; Suppress obedience that would bless the wider church.<p>This mirrors the Pharisees who &#8220;shut the kingdom of heaven in men&#8217;s faces&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-13.htm">Matthew 23:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even putting them out of the church</b><p>Excommunication is meant to protect purity and encourage repentance (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-12.htm">1 Corinthians 5:12-13</a>), yet Diotrephes twists discipline into a weapon against the righteous (<a href="/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34</a>; 16:2). His abuse shows:<p>&#8226; Power without humility becomes tyranny.<p>&#8226; A distorted view of authority expels the very people the Lord commends.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/3_john/1-10.htm">3 John 1:10</a> portrays a leader who slanders apostles, withholds hospitality, bullies supporters, and misuses discipline. John promises to confront this publicly, reminding us that biblical authority serves others, protects truth, and welcomes faithful workers. Real love resists slander, practices generous hospitality, defends obedient believers, and submits every action to Christ, the true Head of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/3_john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver. 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth.</span> The apostle is proceeding on the lines prescribed by Christ. He has remonstrated with Diotrephes privately; he has sent messengers to him to speak in his name, and Diotrephes has declined to receive them. There remains one step more, and St. John means to take it. "If he refuse to hear them, tell <span class="accented">it unto the Church:</span> and if he refuse to hear the Church also, let him be unto thee as the Gentile [<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in verse 7] and the publican" (<a href="/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>). Just as the missionary brethren bore witness before the Church to the Christian love of Gains, so the elder will bear witness before the Church to the arrogant hostility of Diotrephes. Once more we see that <span class="accented">words</span> may be <span class="accented">works.</span> He who sanctions teachers of false doctrine shares in their "evil <span class="accented">works"</span> (<a href="/2_john/1-11.htm">2 John 1:11</a>); and the "works" of Diotrephes partly consist in "prating against us with evil words." The same word for "evil" is used in both cases <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> - the word used to express "the evil one;" the coincidence is significant. The insolent opposition to the apostle on the part of Diotrephes, and the severe language used by St. John in condemning him, stand almost alone in the New Testament. For a parallel to the latter we must look to our Lord's denunciation of the arrogant and hypocritical Pharisees who opposed him. The Pharisees, like Diotrephes, not merely refused to walk in the right path themselves, but hindered those who were entering upon it (<a href="/luke/11-52.htm">Luke 11:52</a>). They also "cast out" those who presumed to take a less narrow view than themselves (<a href="/john/9-34.htm">John 9:34, 35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#8048;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ean)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1437.htm">Strong's 1437: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
