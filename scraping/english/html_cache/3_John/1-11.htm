It reflects the close relationship between John and the recipients of his letters, emphasizing the love and unity that should characterize the Christian community. This term is also used by other apostles, such as Paul, to convey a sense of familial love among believers (e.g., <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/4-14.htm">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>).<p><b>Do not imitate what is evil</b><br>The exhortation to avoid imitating evil is a recurring theme in Scripture. The concept of imitation is significant in the biblical context, as discipleship often involves emulating the character and actions of Christ and other godly examples (<a href="/1_corinthians/11.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>). The warning against imitating evil suggests the presence of negative influences within the community, possibly referring to individuals like Diotrephes mentioned earlier in the letter, who were acting contrary to the teachings of Christ.<p><b>But what is good</b><br>The call to imitate what is good aligns with the biblical emphasis on righteousness and holiness. Goodness is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) and is often associated with God's nature (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>). The pursuit of goodness involves aligning one's actions with God's will and commands, reflecting His character in daily life. This directive encourages believers to seek out and follow godly examples within their community.<p><b>The one who does good is of God</b><br>This phrase underscores the connection between righteous actions and one's relationship with God. Doing good is evidence of a transformed life and a genuine relationship with God (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). It reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The phrase suggests that those who consistently practice goodness demonstrate their divine origin and connection to God.<p><b>The one who does evil has not seen God</b><br>The assertion that those who do evil have not seen God highlights the incompatibility of sin with a true knowledge of God. In biblical terms, "seeing" God often implies a deep, experiential knowledge of Him (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18, 1</a> <a href="/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>). This phrase suggests that persistent evil behavior indicates a lack of genuine relationship with God, as true knowledge of Him results in transformation and a departure from sin. The contrast between good and evil here serves as a test of authentic faith and spiritual insight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples, known for his close relationship with Christ and his emphasis on love and truth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaius.htm">Gaius</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a beloved member of the early Christian community, commended for his faithfulness and hospitality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/diotrephes.htm">Diotrephes</a></b><br>Mentioned earlier in the letter as someone who loves to be first and does not acknowledge the authority of John, representing the "evil" that should not be imitated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/demetrius.htm">Demetrius</a></b><br>Another individual mentioned in the letter, who is well spoken of and serves as an example of someone doing good.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The broader context in which this letter was written, dealing with issues of leadership, authority, and the behavior of believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/imitation_as_a_form_of_discipleship.htm">Imitation as a Form of Discipleship</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to imitate Christ and those who exemplify His character.
