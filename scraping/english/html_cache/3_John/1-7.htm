"The Name" is a reference to Jesus Christ, emphasizing the authority and divine mission associated with His name. In biblical times, names held significant meaning and represented one's character and mission. The act of going out "on behalf of the Name" indicates a commitment to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) and reflects the early church's dedication to evangelism. This mission aligns with the apostolic tradition of spreading the teachings of Jesus, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where the disciples are called to be witnesses "to the ends of the earth."<p><b>accepting nothing from the Gentiles</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the self-sufficiency and integrity of the missionaries. By not accepting support from the Gentiles, they avoided any potential accusations of preaching for financial gain, thus maintaining the purity of their mission. This practice is consistent with Paul's approach in <a href="/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12-18</a>, where he emphasizes preaching the Gospel free of charge to avoid hindering its message. The cultural context of the time involved patron-client relationships, where accepting gifts could imply obligations or influence.
