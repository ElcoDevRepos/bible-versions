This reflects the value placed on direct communication and community, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where believers devoted themselves to fellowship. The phrase "face to face" underscores the intimacy and authenticity of personal interaction, contrasting with the limitations of written correspondence. This desire for personal connection is a recurring theme in John's letters, emphasizing the relational nature of the Christian faith.<p><b>Peace to you.</b><br>The greeting of peace, or "shalom," is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and reflects a holistic sense of well-being, encompassing spiritual, physical, and communal harmony. This blessing is consistent with Jesus' own words in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, where He offers His peace to His disciples. It signifies not just the absence of conflict but the presence of God's favor and blessing. In the context of the early church, this peace was crucial for maintaining unity amidst external persecution and internal challenges.<p><b>The friends here send you greetings.</b><br>This phrase indicates the strong network of relationships within the early Christian communities. The term "friends" suggests a bond deeper than mere acquaintances, reflecting the familial nature of the church. This communal aspect is echoed in <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16</a>, where Paul sends numerous personal greetings, illustrating the interconnectedness of believers across different regions. The sending of greetings also serves to strengthen ties and encourage mutual support among the scattered churches.<p><b>Greet each of our friends there by name.</b><br>John's instruction to greet each friend by name highlights the personal care and attention given to individual members of the church. This practice of naming individuals is seen throughout the New Testament, such as in Paul's letters, where he often mentions specific people (e.g., <a href="/romans/16.htm">Romans 16</a>). It underscores the value of each person within the body of Christ and the importance of personal acknowledgment and encouragement. This personal touch reflects the shepherd-like care that leaders were encouraged to have for their congregations, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_apostle_john.htm">The Apostle John</a></b><br>The author of the letter, traditionally understood to be John the Apostle, one of Jesus' original twelve disciples.

Just as he wrote in 2 <a href="/bsb/john/12.htm">John 12</a>, &#8220;I hope to come to you and talk with you face to face,&#8221; he knows that shared life happens most deeply when believers are together (cf. <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;speak with you face to face&#8221; carries the idea of transparent, unhindered conversation&#8212;no barriers, no misunderstandings. Paul longed for the same in <a href="/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11-12</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, showing that this was the heartbeat of early-church leaders.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;soon&#8221; reminds us that Christian love is eager, not reluctant. It mirrors <a href="/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, where Paul spent &#8220;three years&#8221; warning with tears; shepherding involves time, presence, and affection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Peace to you</b><p>John&#8217;s next sentence is a concise blessing: &#8220;Peace to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Peace&#8221; (shalom) is more than the absence of conflict; it is wholeness and well-being that only Christ provides (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Jesus Himself &#8220;is our peace&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>), this benediction carries real power, not mere sentiment.<p>&#8226; The blessing echoes <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, where God commanded the priests to place His name on the people. John, now an elder apostle, does the same&#8212;confident that the Lord&#8217;s peace will guard hearts and minds (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The friends here send you greetings</b><p>John widens the circle, reminding Gaius that the body of Christ is larger than his local fellowship.<p>&#8226; Christian friendship transcends geography and culture (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;friends&#8221; shows that the love Gaius displays to traveling teachers (3 <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5-8</a>) is being reciprocated. This mutual honor strengthens the church&#8217;s mission.<p>&#8226; Greetings in Scripture are never perfunctory; they knit saints together, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a> and <a href="/hebrews/13-24.htm">Hebrews 13:24</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Greet each of our friends there by name</b><p>John finishes with an instruction that is tender and purposeful.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Each&#8230;by name&#8221; highlights individual worth. Jesus Himself &#8220;calls His own sheep by name&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal recognition safeguards against anonymity and neglect. Paul modeled the same care in <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10-17</a>, mentioning coworkers one by one.<p>&#8226; Naming people promotes accountability and love; it turns abstract fellowship into concrete action (<a href="/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="/luke/10-20.htm">Luke 10:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>3 <a href="/bsb/john/14.htm">John 14</a> reveals a pastor&#8217;s heart overflowing with eagerness for personal fellowship, a blessing of Christ&#8217;s peace, and a web of friendships that are both local and translocal. John teaches that authentic Christianity is relational: we seek one another&#8217;s presence, speak peace grounded in Christ, share greetings that unite distant believers, and honor individuals by name. Peace-filled, face-to-face fellowship is not an optional extra but a vital expression of the gospel lived out in community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/3_john/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I hope</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#960;&#943;&#950;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(elpiz&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1679.htm">Strong's 1679: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hope, hope for, expect, trust.
