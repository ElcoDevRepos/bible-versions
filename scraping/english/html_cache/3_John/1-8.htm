In the context of 3 John, the Apostle John is writing to Gaius, commending him for his hospitality and support of traveling missionaries. The phrase "we ought to support" suggests a moral obligation or duty. In the early church, itinerant preachers and missionaries relied heavily on the hospitality and support of local believers. This support was not just financial but also included providing food, shelter, and encouragement. The early Christian community was characterized by a strong sense of fellowship and mutual aid, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared everything they had. Supporting "such men" refers to those who are spreading the gospel and living according to the truth of Christ, emphasizing the importance of discernment in whom to support.<p><b>so that we may be fellow workers for the truth</b><br>The phrase "fellow workers" implies partnership and collaboration in the mission of spreading the gospel. This concept is echoed in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>, where Paul refers to believers as "God's fellow workers." The "truth" in this context refers to the gospel message and the teachings of Jesus Christ. By supporting those who are actively engaged in ministry, believers become participants in their work, sharing in the spiritual fruits and rewards of their labor. This partnership underscores the communal nature of the Christian mission, where each member of the body of Christ plays a role in advancing the kingdom of God. The idea of being "fellow workers for the truth" also highlights the unity and cooperation that should exist among believers, as they work together to uphold and spread the teachings of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_apostle.htm">John the Apostle</a></b><br>The author of the letter, traditionally understood to be John the Apostle, who is writing to Gaius, a beloved friend and fellow believer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gaius.htm">Gaius</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, commended for his hospitality and support of traveling missionaries.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/traveling_missionaries.htm">Traveling Missionaries</a></b><br>Individuals who were spreading the Gospel and relied on the support of local believers like Gaius.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_early_church.htm">The Early Church</a></b><br>The broader context in which this letter was written, characterized by the spread of Christianity and the need for support among believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_truth.htm">The Truth</a></b><br>A central theme in John's writings, referring to the Gospel message and the teachings of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_support.htm">The Call to Support</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively support those who are dedicated to spreading the Gospel.
