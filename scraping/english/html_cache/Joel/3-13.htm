The imagery of overflowing suggests that the iniquity is not only full but excessive, aligning with the biblical principle that God&#8217;s patience with sin has limits (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).

It is represented by the judgment seat, the harvest, and the vintage. The hour of judgment has arrived--Jehovah Himself is judge. The harvest-time, which is the end of the world, has come--let the angel-reapers put in their sickle. In the wine-press the grapes are gathered in--let the labourers hasten to press the juice out with their feet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/joel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The just decision being come to, and the righteous sentence passed, the execution follows. Jehovah's mighty ones are summoned to execute it. By the mighty ones or heroes of Jehovah are meant his heavenly hosts or angels; thus Kimchi says, "Thy mighty ones are the angels;" so also Aben Ezra. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The execution of Jehovah's command is represented under a double figure, that of reaping grain in harvest or treading grapes in the vintage. Similarly in <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15, 18</a>, we find the two figures - that of reaping the ripe grain, and of gathering the grapes and treading them. The ripeness of the grain and of the grapes is here, perhaps, the prominent idea. "He compares," says Kimchi, "those nations to the produce which is ripe, and its time for harvesting has approached, that man should thrust in the sickle to reap it. So with respect to these nations, their season to die by the sword in this valley has arrived." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig conceives that the twofold command of Jehovah is to cut off the grapes and then tread them in the wine-press. He proceeds on the wrong assumption that <span class="accented">qatsir</span>, harvest, is employed in the sense of <span class="accented">batsir</span>, vintage; that <span class="accented">maggal</span> (from <span class="accented">nagal</span>, unused to cut, pierce, wound) is for <span class="accented">mazmerah</span>, the hook of the vinedresser; while <span class="accented">bashal</span>, ripe, which he restricts to grapes, applies to grapes and corn alike. The passage in Revelation already cited decides us in favour of (1), the judgment being represented first by the reaping of ripened grain, and then by treading grapes in the wine-press. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span>, from <span class="accented">radah</span>, to trample underfoot, and not from <span class="accented">yarad</span>, to descend, is more poetic and emphatic than the usual <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5d3;</span>; though Kimchi maintains the contrary, saying, "<span class="accented">Descend</span> ye into this valley, for it is as it were the press which is full of grapes, when it is fit to tread them; so ye house of Israel, tread these nations in this valley, and thrust in among them the sword." The fulness of the vats, again, represents the masses of the sinful nations ripe and ready for destruction; what the wine-press is to the grapes, the wine-press of God's wrath is to the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Swing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;il&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the sickle,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(mag&#183;g&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4038.htm">Strong's 4038: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sickle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the harvest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7105.htm">Strong's 7105: </a> </span><span class="str2">Severed, harvest, the crop, the time, the reaper, a limb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is ripe.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#353;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1310.htm">Strong's 1310: </a> </span><span class="str2">To boil up, cooking, to ripen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Come,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">trample the grapes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3381.htm">Strong's 3381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come or go down, descend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the winepress</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1428;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ga&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1660.htm">Strong's 1660: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wine-press</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is full;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4390.htm">Strong's 4390: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fill, be full of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the wine vats</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
