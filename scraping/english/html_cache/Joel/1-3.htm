The transmission of stories and teachings from one generation to the next was crucial for maintaining the identity and faith of the people. This command reflects the broader biblical mandate to teach children about God's works and laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach their children. The act of telling ensures that the lessons and warnings of the past are not forgotten, particularly the events described in the book of Joel, which include a devastating locust plague symbolizing divine judgment.<p><b>let your children tell it to their children,</b><br>This continuation underscores the multi-generational aspect of faith transmission. It highlights the responsibility of each generation to pass on the knowledge and experiences of God's dealings with His people. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/psalms/78-4.htm">Psalm 78:4-6</a>, which speaks of declaring God's praises and wonders to the next generation. The emphasis on storytelling serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where each generation is called to remember and uphold the covenant.<p><b>and their children to the next generation.</b><br>The phrase extends the chain of transmission indefinitely, suggesting that the lessons learned are timeless and perpetually relevant. This reflects the biblical view of history as a continuum where God's actions and teachings are ever-present and applicable. The call to pass on these teachings aligns with the prophetic tradition, where prophets like Joel serve as messengers of God's word, meant to be heeded by all future generations. This enduring legacy is also seen in the New Testament, where the teachings of Jesus Christ are to be shared with all nations, as in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, ensuring that the message of salvation reaches every generation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Joel's prophecy was directed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_locust_plague.htm">The Locust Plague</a></b><br>A devastating event described in Joel, symbolizing judgment and calling for repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/generations.htm">Generations</a></b><br>The focus on passing down the message through successive generations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_the_lord.htm">The Day of the LORD</a></b><br>A central theme in Joel, referring to a time of divine intervention and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_spiritual_legacy.htm">The Importance of Spiritual Legacy</a></b><br>Passing down faith is a biblical mandate.

The prophet thus draws attention to the event which be is about to relate, or rather predict, a8 a calamity unknown in the memory of living men, unheard of in the days of their fathers, unparalleled in the past experience of their nation, and one affecting all the inhabitants of the land. He challenges the old men whose memory went furthest back, and whose experience had been longest and largest, to confirm his statements; he calls on the inhabitants of the land to consider an event in which they were all concerned, and to recognize the hand of God in a disaster in which all would be involved. But, though the visitation with which they are threatened had had no precedent or parallel among the generation then present, or that which preceded it, or for many long years before, it was not to remain without memorial or record in the time to come. To this end the prophet commands his countrymen of Judah to relate it to their children, to their grandchildren, and even to their great-grand-children. The expression reminds us of Virgil's - <p><span class="accented">"Yea, sons of sons, and those who shall from them be born."</span> It reads like a reminiscence of what is recorded of one of the plagues - the plague of locusts - in Egypt, of which we read in <a href="/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>, "Which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day they were upon the earth unto this day;" while the direction to have it transmitted by tradition seems an echo of what we read in the second verse of the same chapter: "That thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt." Similarly, it is written in <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5, 6</a>, "He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: that the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children." The solemn manner in which the prophet draws attention to this by "Hear," "Give ear," and the earnestness with which he insists on the record of it being handed on from generation to generation, are intended to impress on the people the work of God in this visitation, its severity, the sin that caused it, and the call to repentance conveyed by it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(sap&#183;p&#234;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5608.htm">Strong's 5608: </a> </span><span class="str2">To count, recount, relate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#7687;&#183;n&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
