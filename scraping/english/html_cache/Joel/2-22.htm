In the context of Joel, the land had suffered devastation from locusts, a common biblical symbol of judgment (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>). The call for the beasts not to fear indicates a reversal of this judgment. Biblically, animals often represent the natural order, and their well-being is a sign of God's blessing (<a href="/genesis/1-30.htm">Genesis 1:30</a>). The reassurance given to the beasts reflects God's comprehensive restoration plan, which includes all creation (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>).<p><b>for the open pastures have turned green</b><br>The greening of pastures signifies the end of drought and famine, a common consequence of divine judgment in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23-24</a>). This imagery of renewal is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2</a>, where green pastures symbolize peace and provision. Geographically, the land of Israel is dependent on seasonal rains, and the turning green of pastures would be a visible sign of God's favor and the return of His blessings.<p><b>the trees bear their fruit</b><br>Fruit-bearing trees are a sign of agricultural abundance and prosperity. In the ancient Near East, fruitfulness was often associated with divine favor (<a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>). The restoration of fruit trees would have been particularly significant for an agrarian society reliant on such produce for sustenance and trade. This phrase also echoes the promise of restoration found in <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14</a>, where God promises to restore the fortunes of His people.<p><b>and the fig tree and vine yield their best</b><br>The fig tree and vine are frequently used in Scripture to symbolize Israel's spiritual and physical prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). Their yielding of the best fruit indicates not just survival but thriving under God's blessing. The fig tree and vine are also eschatological symbols, pointing to the Messianic age of peace and abundance (<a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus uses the fig tree as a metaphor for recognizing the signs of the times (<a href="/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32-33</a>), linking this imagery to prophetic fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Joel's prophecies were directed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beasts_of_the_field.htm">Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Represents the animals that rely on the land for sustenance, symbolizing God's provision for all creation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/open_pastures.htm">Open Pastures</a></b><br>The fields that had been devastated by locusts, now restored to fertility.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fig_tree_and_vine.htm">Fig Tree and Vine</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity and blessing, often used in Scripture to represent Israel's spiritual and physical health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_restoration.htm">God's Provision and Restoration</a></b><br>God is faithful to restore what has been lost, both physically and spiritually.

The dumb animals had groaned in distress for food, but now they too have cause to rejoice, and are here called on to do so; and the suitable cause in their case is also specified. It is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">For the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength</span>. He thus specifies the ground of gladness in their case also, pointing to the fresh green of the pastures and the fruit hanging in rich abundance and variety on the trees. The fruits of vines and fig trees are net, it is true, the food of the beasts of the fields; but the revival of vegetation in trees, the higher and larger growths, the chief factor in which is moisture, comprehends the revival of the smaller growths of herbs, grasses, and plants, the proper sustenance of cattle. Kimchi's explanation is that "as the tree bears its fruit in the inhabited part of the world, so in the wilderness the places of pasture grow green." Aben Ezra, who never loses an opportunity of directing attention to contrasts wherever they exist, contrasts "Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field," in this verse with "the beasts of the field cry also unto thee" at the close of the preceding chapter; also "the pastures of the wilderness do spring" with "the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness;" likewise "the tree beareth her fruit" with "all the trees of the field are withered." It has been observed that all plants, even shrubs and trees, spring up at the first as the fresh young juicy green of plants, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>;
