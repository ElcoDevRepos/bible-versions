The ruin of the fields signifies a severe judgment from God, often seen in the Old Testament as a consequence of the people's disobedience. The imagery of ruined fields is reminiscent of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-42</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural failure. This devastation serves as a tangible sign of divine displeasure and a call to repentance.<p><b>the land mourns.</b><br>The personification of the land mourning emphasizes the severity of the calamity. In biblical literature, the land often reflects the spiritual state of the people (<a href="/isaiah/24-4.htm">Isaiah 24:4-7</a>). The mourning land indicates a deep, communal grief over the loss of God's blessings and the disruption of the covenant relationship. This mourning is not just physical but spiritual, as the land's condition mirrors the people's estrangement from God.<p><b>For the grain is destroyed,</b><br>Grain was a staple food and a symbol of God's provision. Its destruction signifies not only physical hunger but also spiritual famine. The loss of grain disrupts the cycle of offerings and feasts, which were central to Israel's worship and covenant life (Leviticus 23). This destruction can be seen as a fulfillment of prophetic warnings, such as those in <a href="/amos/4-6.htm">Amos 4:6-9</a>, where God uses famine to call His people back to Himself.<p><b>the new wine is dried up,</b><br>New wine represents joy and celebration in the Bible (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Its drying up indicates a loss of joy and the cessation of festive activities. Wine was also used in offerings, and its absence would affect religious practices (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>). This imagery connects to the broader theme of judgment and the need for repentance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/24-7.htm">Isaiah 24:7-11</a>, where joy is removed due to the people's unfaithfulness.<p><b>and the oil fails.</b><br>Oil was essential for daily life, used in cooking, lighting, and anointing. Its failure signifies a breakdown in both domestic and religious life. Oil was a symbol of the Holy Spirit and God's anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), and its absence suggests a withdrawal of divine favor and presence. This failure can be linked to the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where oil represents readiness and spiritual preparedness. The lack of oil underscores the urgent need for the people to return to God and seek His restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Joel's prophecy is directed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Represents the agricultural land of Judah, which is central to their economy and sustenance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/grain,_new_wine,_oil.htm">Grain, New Wine, Oil</a></b><br>Key agricultural products in ancient Israel, symbolizing prosperity and God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Personified as mourning, indicating the severity of the devastation and its impact on the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The devastation of the land serves as a vivid reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

This verse is closely connected with the preceding, for the failure of the meat offerings and drink offerings was owing to the devastation of the country and the destruction of its crops by the locust-plague. The field was laid waste by them, nor was it a field here and there, or a solitary district; it was the whole land without exception or exemption that had cause to grieve, "if aught inanimate e'er grieves." This is expressed by one of those paronomasias of which the Hebrews were so fond, thus, <span class="accented">shuddad sadheh</span>, <span class="accented">abhelah adhamah</span>, equivalent to "field falls, ground grieves;" or "field fruitless, land laments." The oblation, or meat offering, consisted of flour mingled with oil; the libation, or drink offering, consisted of wine. There were also firstfruits of corn and wine and oil; while all the produce of the land was tithabla. Now, however, the corn was wasted and the oil languished; and therefore the meat offering had partially failed or entirely ceased; the new wine was dried up, and therefore the drink offering must needs have been given up. The mention of corn and wine and oil in particular is owing to their connection with the temple service, for the firstfruits, tithes, oblations, and libations depended largely upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The field</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7695;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
