The concept of divine jealousy is rooted in God&#8217;s exclusive claim to His people, akin to a marriage covenant (<a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>). This jealousy is not petty but reflects God&#8217;s desire for His people to remain faithful to Him. The land, often seen as an extension of the covenant, holds significant theological importance, as it was promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This moment marks God&#8217;s readiness to act on behalf of His land, which had suffered due to the people's sins and the resulting locust plague.<p><b>and He spared His people</b><br>God&#8217;s sparing of His people demonstrates His mercy and willingness to forgive when they repent. This act of sparing is consistent with His character throughout Scripture, where He often relents from sending calamity when His people turn back to Him (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). The historical context of Joel involves a devastating locust plague, which serves as both a literal and metaphorical representation of judgment. The sparing of the people signifies a restoration and a return to favor, echoing themes found in other prophetic books such as Hosea and Amos. This also foreshadows the ultimate sparing and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who provides a way for humanity to be reconciled to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is characterized by His holiness, justice, and mercy.

These are divisible into two parts. In the first division the prophet assures his countrymen of the bestowal of temporal mercies, and in the second of the promise of spiritual blessings. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The futures of this verse with <span class="accented">vav consec</span>, are properly taken as perfects; nor is there any inconsistency, provided we understand, as following ver. 17 and preceding ver. 18, the fact that the priests had engaged in the penitence enjoined, and offered the supplication to which they had been summoned; neither is the omission of any express mention of the circumstance thus supposed to intervene between these verses any valid objection, especially as the grammar favours the view in question. Then follows a manifestation of God's mercy in answer to the assumed penitence and prayer of his servants. God's jealousy and pity are both engaged - his jealousy for his land, and his compassion for his people. His jealousy is figurative, and the allusion is probably to that of a husband who is jealous on account of any dishonour done to his wife, and who resents it more keenly than a dishonour offered to himself. The pity is such as God ever manifests to his people when penitent; for "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">became jealous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;qan&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7065.htm">Strong's 7065: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, zealous, jealous, envious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for His land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and spared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7717;&#183;m&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2550.htm">Strong's 2550: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commiserate, to spare</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His people.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/joel/2-18.htm">OT Prophets: Joel 2:18 Then Yahweh was jealous for his land (Jl Joe.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/joel/2-17.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Joel 2:17"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joel 2:17" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/joel/2-19.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Joel 2:19"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joel 2:19" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
