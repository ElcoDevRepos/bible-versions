In the ancient Near Eastern context, horses were symbols of power and military strength, often associated with chariots and warfare. The imagery suggests an unstoppable and disciplined army, evoking fear and awe. This comparison can also be seen in <a href="/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a>, where locusts are described with similar characteristics, indicating a connection between Joel's prophecy and apocalyptic visions.<p><b>and they gallop like swift steeds</b><br>The emphasis on speed and agility highlights the relentless and overwhelming advance of the locusts. In biblical times, swift steeds were prized for their ability to cover great distances quickly, often used in battle to outmaneuver enemies. This imagery underscores the urgency and inevitability of the coming judgment. The swiftness of the locusts can be seen as a metaphor for the rapid unfolding of God's plans, as seen in other prophetic texts like <a href="/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>, where the Chaldeans are described with similar speed. This also points to the divine orchestration behind the events, as God uses natural phenomena to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Joel is the author of the book that bears his name.
