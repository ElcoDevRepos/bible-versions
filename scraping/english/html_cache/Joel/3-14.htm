The "valley of decision" is often identified with the Valley of Jehoshaphat, a symbolic place of judgment. The repetition of "multitudes" underscores the enormity and urgency of the situation. In biblical context, this gathering represents nations being brought together for divine judgment. The imagery of a valley suggests a low point or a place where decisions are made, reflecting the gravity of the impending judgment. This scene is reminiscent of other biblical gatherings for judgment, such as in <a href="/revelation/16-16.htm">Revelation 16:16</a>, where nations are gathered at Armageddon.<p><b>For the Day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</b><br>The "Day of the LORD" is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, signifying a time of God's intervention in human history, often associated with judgment and salvation. The nearness of this day indicates its imminence and the urgency for repentance and readiness. The "valley of decision" here serves as a metaphorical setting for God's final judgment, where decisions are rendered, and destinies are sealed. This concept is echoed in other prophetic books, such as <a href="/zephaniah/1-14.htm">Zephaniah 1:14-18</a>, which also speaks of the Day of the LORD as a time of wrath and distress. The phrase calls to mind the ultimate accountability before God, urging individuals and nations to consider their standing before Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/multitudes.htm">Multitudes</a></b><br>Represents the vast number of people gathered for judgment.
