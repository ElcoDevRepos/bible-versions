They were responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the sanctity of the temple. This phrase emphasizes the importance of spiritual leaders in interceding for the nation. The priests' role is reminiscent of the Levitical priesthood established in the Mosaic Law, highlighting their duty to lead the people in repentance and prayer.<p><b>weep between the portico and the altar</b><br>The portico and the altar were parts of the temple structure, with the portico being the entrance and the altar being the place of sacrifice. This location signifies a place of deep intercession and lamentation. The act of weeping indicates sincere repentance and sorrow for sin. This imagery is consistent with other biblical instances where leaders intercede for the people, such as Moses and Aaron in <a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Spare Your people, O LORD</b><br>This plea for mercy reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The call for God to spare His people is rooted in His promises and faithfulness. It echoes the intercessory prayers of figures like Abraham and Moses, who appealed to God's mercy on behalf of others. The request for sparing is a recognition of God's sovereignty and compassion.<p><b>and do not make Your heritage a reproach</b><br>Israel is often referred to as God's heritage, a people chosen and set apart for His purposes. The concern here is for the reputation of God's people and, by extension, God's own name. A reproach would imply failure and disgrace, which would reflect poorly on God's covenant promises. This plea is similar to Moses' intercession in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, where he appeals to God's reputation among the nations.<p><b>an object of scorn among the nations</b><br>The fear of becoming a scorn among the nations highlights the importance of Israel's witness to the surrounding peoples. In the ancient Near East, the fortunes of a nation were often seen as a reflection of the power of their deity. Thus, Israel's downfall would lead other nations to question the power and faithfulness of Yahweh. This concern is echoed in <a href="/psalms/79-4.htm">Psalm 79:4</a>, where the psalmist laments the scorn of neighboring nations.<p><b>Why should they say among the peoples, &#8216;Where is their God?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the potential damage to God's reputation if His people are not delivered. It reflects a concern for God's honor and the perception of His power and presence. The question "Where is their God?" implies doubt about God's ability to protect and provide for His people. This theme is also found in <a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>, where the psalmist's adversaries question God's presence during times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Israel responsible for performing sacrifices and interceding for the people.

To stand between them placed the priests in the very heart of worship, visually demonstrating brokenness before God (<a href="/lamentations/2-17.htm">Lamentations 2:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Tears show genuine contrition (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). This is not a performance but heart-deep grief over sin&#8217;s dishonor to the Lord and its damage to His people (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Public weeping also reminds the congregation that God takes holiness seriously (<a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying, &#8220;Spare Your people, O LORD&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The prayer begins with mercy, not merit. Israel appeals to God&#8217;s covenant love&#8212;His hesed&#8212;rather than to any righteousness of their own (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8-10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Spare&#8221; shows faith in God&#8217;s willingness to relent when His people truly repent (<a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Even after locust devastation, the plea assumes He can still reverse the damage (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>). Hope always accompanies repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do not make Your heritage a reproach, an object of scorn among the nations.</b><p>&#8226; Israel is God&#8217;s &#8220;heritage,&#8221; His treasured possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>). The priests remind God of His own declaration, anchoring their request in His revealed purposes.<p>&#8226; A &#8220;reproach&#8221; means open humiliation. When God&#8217;s people suffer disgrace for their sin, His name is dragged through the mud (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; By praying this, the priests place God&#8217;s reputation above their comfort, aligning with other intercessors like Moses (<a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-16</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/isaiah/37-20.htm">Isaiah 37:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why should they say among the peoples, &#8216;Where is their God?&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The ultimate concern is God&#8217;s glory. Pagan nations mocking Israel question the very existence and power of the LORD (<a href="/psalms/42-3.htm">Psalm 42:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/115-2.htm">Psalm 115:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The priests argue from God&#8217;s own honor: if judgment continues, enemies will misread it as divine impotence. Vindicating His name by restoring His people displays His sovereignty to the world (<a href="/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This petition anticipates Christ&#8217;s teaching that we pray, &#8220;Hallowed be Your name&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>). God&#8217;s reputation and our restoration are inseparable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a> calls spiritual leaders to visible, heartfelt repentance that prioritizes God&#8217;s glory. Standing in the temple&#8217;s very center, they plead for mercy on the basis of God&#8217;s covenant love and His own reputation among the nations. Their example invites every believer today to intercede boldly, knowing that when God revives His people, the watching world sees unmistakably where their God is&#8212;enthroned, merciful, and mighty to save.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">That the heathen should rule over them.--</span>All mention of the locusts is dropped.
