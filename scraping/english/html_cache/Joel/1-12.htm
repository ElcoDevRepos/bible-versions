The drying up of the grapevine signifies a loss of abundance and divine favor. In the context of Joel, this imagery reflects the devastating locust plague and drought that have struck the land, serving as a divine judgment. The grapevine's condition also foreshadows the spiritual barrenness of the people, calling them to repentance.<p><b>and the fig tree is withered</b><br>The fig tree is another symbol of Israel and often represents peace and security (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>). Its withering indicates a severe disruption in the nation's stability and well-being. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament when Jesus curses the barren fig tree (<a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>), symbolizing judgment on unfruitfulness. The withering of the fig tree in Joel underscores the urgency for the people to return to God.<p><b>the pomegranate, palm, and apple&#8212;all the trees of the orchard&#8212;are withered</b><br>These trees represent the richness and variety of the land's produce. The pomegranate is often associated with fertility and abundance (<a href="/songs/4-3.htm">Song of Solomon 4:3</a>), while the palm symbolizes victory and triumph (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). The apple, or possibly the apricot or quince, signifies beauty and desire (<a href="/songs/2-3.htm">Song of Solomon 2:3</a>). The withering of these trees indicates a comprehensive devastation affecting all aspects of life and sustenance. This serves as a metaphor for the spiritual desolation of the people, highlighting the need for divine intervention and restoration.<p><b>Surely the joy of mankind has dried up</b><br>The joy of mankind is linked to the blessings and provisions of God. In biblical times, agricultural success was directly tied to divine favor, and its absence led to despair and lamentation. This phrase captures the emotional and spiritual impact of the physical devastation described earlier. It echoes the broader biblical theme that true joy and fulfillment come from a right relationship with God (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The drying up of joy calls the people to recognize their dependence on God and to seek His mercy and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah during a time of crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Joel's prophecy is directed, experiencing a devastating locust plague and drought.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vine_and_fig_tree.htm">Vine and Fig Tree</a></b><br>Symbolic of prosperity and peace in Israel, often used in the Old Testament to represent the nation's well-being.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pomegranate,_palm,_and_apple_trees.htm">Pomegranate, Palm, and Apple Trees</a></b><br>Represent the agricultural abundance of the land, now suffering due to the calamity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_withering.htm">The Withering</a></b><br>A metaphor for the spiritual and physical desolation experienced by the people, reflecting their loss of joy and sustenance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_drought.htm">Spiritual Drought</a></b><br>Just as the physical drought affected the land, spiritual drought can affect our lives when we turn away from God.

When Joel writes, &#8220;The grapevine is dried up&#8221; (<a href="/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>), the literal loss of grapes means no wine for offerings or celebration (cf. <a href="/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>).<p>- Drought and locusts are covenant curses promised for disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-40</a>). The dried vine signals that those warnings have become reality.<p>- Spiritually, a fruitless vine mirrors a fruitless life (<a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>). Where there is no fruit, there is judgment, not joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the fig tree is withered</b><p>- The fig tree often represents Israel&#8217;s national health (<a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>). Its withering shows the people themselves are spiritually barren.<p>- Jesus later curses an unfruitful fig tree to illustrate hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/21-19.htm">Matthew 21:19</a>). Joel&#8217;s generation already tasted that lesson: empty religion produces no figs.<p>- Practically, figs were a staple food (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>). Their loss magnifies the severity of the crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the pomegranate, palm, and apple&#8212;all the trees of the orchard&#8212;are withered</b><p>- Pomegranates decorated the high-priestly robe and the temple (<a href="/exodus/28-34.htm">Exodus 28:34</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm">1 Kings 7:18</a>), symbolizing beauty and worship. Their withering hints at worship disrupted.<p>- The date palm supplied shade and sweetness (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). Apples (or apricots) refreshed the weary (Song of Songs 2:5). Every layer of daily pleasure is gone.<p>- <a href="/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> paints a similar &#8220;nothing left&#8221; scene. Joel emphasizes totality: not one kind of tree, but &#8220;all&#8221; of them&#8212;comprehensive judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surely the joy of mankind has dried up</b><p>- When sustenance and symbols of blessing disappear, gladness evaporates. Joel later asks, &#8220;Has not food been cut off before our eyes, joy and gladness from the house of our God?&#8221; (<a href="/joel/1-16.htm">Joel 1:16</a>).<p>- Joy is tied to God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>). Without fruit, festivals cease; without worship, hearts empty (<a href="/lamentations/5-15.htm">Lamentations 5:15-16</a>).<p>- Yet loss prepares the way for repentance and future restoration (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-14, 23</a>). God will eventually &#8220;restore to you the years the locust has eaten&#8221; (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>), turning dried-up joy into overflowing rejoicing (<a href="/john/15-11.htm">John 15:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a> pictures a land stripped of every fruitful sign of God&#8217;s favor&#8212;vine, fig, pomegranate, palm, apple.
