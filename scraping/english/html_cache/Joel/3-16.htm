Zion, often synonymous with Jerusalem, is the spiritual and political center of Israel. The imagery of a lion roaring is used to convey God's might and the impending judgment. This echoes <a href="/amos/1-2.htm">Amos 1:2</a>, where the Lord's voice is described as a roar from Zion, indicating a divine intervention. The roar symbolizes both judgment against the nations and protection for His people.<p><b>and raise His voice from Jerusalem;</b><br>Jerusalem is the city chosen by God to place His name (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>). It is the location of the Temple, the center of worship for Israel. The raising of God's voice from Jerusalem emphasizes His sovereign rule and the centrality of Jerusalem in His plans. This also connects to the prophetic vision of Jerusalem as the focal point of God's kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>).<p><b>heaven and earth will tremble.</b><br>This phrase indicates a cosmic disturbance, reflecting the magnitude of God's intervention. The trembling of heaven and earth is a common biblical motif for divine judgment and theophany (<a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>, <a href="/haggai/2-6.htm">Haggai 2:6</a>). It signifies the awe-inspiring power of God that affects all creation, underscoring His ultimate authority over the universe.<p><b>But the LORD will be a refuge for His people,</b><br>Despite the fearsome display of power, God provides protection and safety for His people. The concept of God as a refuge is a recurring theme in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). It assures believers of God's faithfulness and care, even amidst judgment. This dual aspect of God as both judge and protector is central to understanding His character.<p><b>a stronghold for the people of Israel.</b><br>A stronghold represents a place of security and defense. For Israel, this assurance is rooted in their covenant relationship with God. The imagery of God as a stronghold is found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), emphasizing His role as a defender and sustainer of His people. This promise of protection is a source of hope and encouragement, especially in times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is depicted as a mighty warrior and protector of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A hill in Jerusalem, often used symbolically in the Bible to represent the city of Jerusalem and the presence of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, central to Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven_and_earth.htm">Heaven and Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of the entire creation, which responds to the voice and actions of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are promised protection and refuge by the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The imagery of the LORD roaring from Zion highlights His supreme authority over all creation.

The majestic roar of the lion is transferred to express victorious utterance of the Lord's judgment: it is irresistible. As St. Paul wrote, "The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1Thessalonians 2:16</a>).

The presence of Jehovah is the immediate occasion of these terrors; and hence his voice proceeds from Jerusalem, or more particularly from Zion, where the visible symbol of his presence long dwelt. "For there," says Kimchi, "was his dwelling in Jerusalem; and as if from thence he roared and uttered his voice against them." Thus far the prophet pictures in very vivid, indeed terribly vivid, colours the frightful scene in the valley of decision: then stops short without describing the sad catastrophe resulting from the actual execution of the judgment. This he omits, either from revulsion of feeling from such misery. or the reader <span class="accented">is</span> left to imagine it himself. <span class="cmt_word">But the Lord will be the Hope of his people, and the Strength of the children of Israel</span>. He shrinks, as we have seen, from describing the actual execution of judgment, and, breaking off with somewhat of abruptness, exhibits the bright side of the picture. With the destruction of his foes is joined, as usual, the deliverance of his friends. To his people he stands in the double relation of a Place of refuge (<span class="accented">machseh</span>) and a Place of strength (<span class="accented">ma'oz</span>), that is, not only a place to which they may flee for safety, but a place in which, as a stronghold, they shall be kept safe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/joel/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
