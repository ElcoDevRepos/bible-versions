Locust plagues were well-known in the region and often symbolized divine judgment. The "devouring locust" represents the initial wave of destruction, consuming crops and vegetation. In the biblical context, locusts are frequently used as instruments of God's judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>). This imagery underscores the severity of the calamity facing Israel, emphasizing the totality of the destruction.<p><b>the swarming locust has eaten</b><br>The "swarming locust" signifies a second wave of devastation, following the initial destruction. This reflects the relentless nature of the judgment, as each successive group of locusts continues the work of the previous one. The swarming nature of these locusts highlights the overwhelming and inescapable nature of the disaster. In a broader biblical context, swarming locusts can symbolize overwhelming forces or armies (<a href="/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>), further emphasizing the theme of divine retribution.<p><b>what the swarming locust has left, the young locust has eaten</b><br>The "young locust" represents a third stage in the locust plague, indicating that even the remnants left by the previous waves are not spared. This phrase suggests a thorough and complete devastation, leaving no hope for recovery. The use of "young locust" may also imply a new generation, indicating that the destruction is ongoing and persistent. This relentless cycle of destruction serves as a metaphor for the consequences of sin and disobedience, as seen in other prophetic writings (<a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>).<p><b>and what the young locust has left, the destroying locust has eaten</b><br>The "destroying locust" completes the cycle of devastation, ensuring that nothing is left untouched. This final wave of destruction underscores the totality and finality of the judgment. In the broader biblical narrative, such complete destruction often precedes a call to repentance and restoration (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-13.htm">2 Chronicles 7:13-14</a>). The imagery of the destroying locust can also be seen as a type of ultimate judgment, pointing to the need for divine intervention and redemption, themes that are fulfilled in the person and work of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, the primary audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/locust_plague.htm">Locust Plague</a></b><br>A devastating event symbolizing judgment and calling for repentance, described in escalating stages of destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The ultimate authority behind the message, using natural events to communicate spiritual truths.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Represents the physical and spiritual state of the people, suffering due to their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is real and can manifest in various forms, including natural disasters.

"Behold the desolation!" "Note the cause." The earth is bared by locusts beyond all previous experience. There were different sorts of locusts; as many as ninety have been reckoned.
