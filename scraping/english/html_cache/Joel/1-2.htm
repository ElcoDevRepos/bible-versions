In ancient Israelite society, elders were often responsible for making important decisions and guiding the people. This call to the elders emphasizes the seriousness of the message and the need for wise leadership in times of crisis. The role of elders is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, where Moses is instructed to gather the elders of Israel. This highlights the importance of communal leadership and accountability.<p><b>and give ear, all who dwell in the land.</b><br>This phrase extends the call to attention beyond the elders to include all inhabitants of the land, indicating that the message is of national importance. The "land" refers to the territory of Judah, the southern kingdom of Israel. The inclusion of all people underscores the communal nature of the impending disaster and the collective responsibility to respond. This call to listen is reminiscent of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where Israel is commanded to hear and obey God's commandments.<p><b>Has anything like this ever happened in your days</b><br>This rhetorical question is designed to provoke reflection and acknowledgment of the unprecedented nature of the events being described. It suggests a calamity so severe that it surpasses any previous experiences of the current generation. This could refer to the locust plague described later in the book, which serves as both a literal disaster and a metaphor for impending judgment. The uniqueness of the event is meant to awaken the people to the seriousness of their situation.<p><b>or in the days of your fathers?</b><br>By invoking the "days of your fathers," the text connects the present crisis to the historical experiences of previous generations. This reference to the past serves as a reminder of God's past judgments and deliverances, encouraging the people to consider their history and learn from it. It also emphasizes the continuity of God's relationship with His people across generations. The mention of "fathers" can be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/78-3.htm">Psalm 78:3-4</a>, where the deeds of the Lord are recounted to future generations, highlighting the importance of remembering and learning from history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joel.htm">Joel</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering God's message to the people of Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>The leaders and older members of the community, responsible for guiding and advising the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_land.htm">Inhabitants of the Land</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Judah, the audience of Joel's prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Joel's prophecy is directed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>A devastating locust plague, symbolizing impending judgment and calling for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_listening.htm">The Importance of Listening</a></b><br>Joel begins with a call to "hear" and "give ear," emphasizing the need for attentiveness to God's word.

Much like Moses calling &#8220;Gather the people, the men, the women and children&#8221; in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>, Joel reminds the elders that spiritual accountability begins with them.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hear this&#8221; carries the same weight as &#8220;Hear, O Israel&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>)&#8212;a command, not a suggestion. The Lord is demanding undivided attention because His message concerns real, present judgment, not a mere illustration.<p>&#8226; Elders are to discern the times (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>) and instruct the people (<a href="/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>). If they will listen, the nation has hope; if they refuse, <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a> warns, &#8220;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give ear, all who dwell in the land</b><p>&#8226; The summons immediately widens to every inhabitant. Judgment is not selective; everyone in Judah will feel the impact, similar to the universal reach of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Give ear&#8221; echoes <a href="/jeremiah/13-15.htm">Jeremiah 13:15</a>: &#8220;Listen and give ear; do not be proud, for the LORD has spoken.&#8221; Pride dulls hearing; humility sharpens it.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all who dwell in the land&#8221; highlights that this is a literal geographic event striking the covenant land itself, fulfilling warnings like <a href="/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a> where God promised to &#8220;destroy your yield.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By addressing the entire population, Joel preempts the excuse that calamity concerns only political leaders or the especially wicked. <a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a> reminds us all stand accountable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has anything like this ever happened in your days</b><p>&#8226; Joel points to an unparalleled catastrophe: an actual, devastating locust invasion. The literal nature of the question is reinforced when later verses detail four successive locust swarms (<a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often appeals to historical memory to stress severity. When <a href="/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a> asks, &#8220;Has a nation ever exchanged its gods?&#8221; he likewise underscores something unheard-of.<p>&#8226; This rhetorical question jolts complacency: if nothing comparable has happened, then routine explanations will not suffice. As Jesus warned in <a href="/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a> of a tribulation &#8220;unequaled from the beginning,&#8221; Joel&#8217;s crisis also foreshadows future judgments that defy precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or in the days of your fathers?</b><p>&#8226; Looking back through family history is biblical practice for recognizing God&#8217;s works (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>). If even the elders&#8217; ancestors never saw such devastation, the current generation must interpret it as extraordinary divine intervention.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a> speaks of &#8220;the deeds You performed in days long ago.&#8221; Israel was accustomed to recalling mighty acts of salvation; now they must recall an act of chastening just as diligently.<p>&#8226; The comparison to &#8220;your fathers&#8221; builds urgency to instruct coming generations, a command Joel will state explicitly in verse 3. Unprecedented judgment becomes a teaching tool so &#8220;the next generation might know&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-6.htm">Psalm 78:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By invoking ancestral memory, God underscores covenant continuity: the same Lord who once rescued with plagues is now disciplining with plagues. The covenant blessings and curses of <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> remain in full, literal force.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/joel/1-2.htm">Joel 1:2</a> is a divine wake-up call. God commands the leaders first, then every resident of Judah, to listen carefully because a disaster unlike anything in living or remembered history has struck. The unprecedented locust plague is literal evidence that the covenant-keeping God is actively judging sin. Memory of past generations proves no one has experienced such severity, heightening the need for repentance and for passing the lesson to future generations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/joel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2, 3) <span class= "bld">Hath this been in your days.--</span>The introduction points to the startling nature of the portent: it was unexampled; it was a cause of consternation to all who beheld it; it would be recollected as a subject of wondering comment among succeeding generations.
