The term "Behold" serves as a call to attention, emphasizing the importance of the message. The context is the aftermath of the Babylonian exile, where Israelites were scattered and sold into slavery. The promise to "rouse them" suggests a divine awakening or stirring, reminiscent of God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). This also foreshadows the gathering of God's people from all nations, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a>. The historical context involves the practice of selling captives as slaves, a common occurrence in ancient warfare. This phrase assures that God will reverse the fortunes of His people, bringing them back from the lands of their captivity.<p><b>I will return your recompense upon your heads.</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to divine justice and retribution. The phrase "return your recompense" implies that those who have wronged God's people will face consequences equivalent to their actions. This is consistent with the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The "heads" symbolize personal accountability and direct impact, indicating that the judgment will be personal and unavoidable. Historically, this reflects the fate of nations like Babylon and Edom, who faced divine judgment for their treatment of Israel (<a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12-14</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and justice, ensuring that evil does not go unpunished. This also points to the ultimate judgment at the end of times, where all will be held accountable before God (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people who were sold into slavery by their enemies.

Instead of "raise," some prefer "waken," "rouse," or "stir up." The Judaeans would be roused out of the countries into which they had been sold, and restored to their own land, and the measure which had been meted to them meted in turn to their enemies. The deliverance mentioned here may be exemplified, if not realized in part, in the time of Alexander the Great and his successors, when Jewish captives in many lands were set at liberty. Thus Demetrius, in his letter to Jonathan, writes, "I also make free all those Jews who have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom." <span class="cmt_word">And will return your recompense upon your own head</span>; better rendered, <span class="accented">and will turn back your doing upon your head.</span> A righteous retaliation awaited Philistines and Phoenicians.
