It suggests a period of waiting or transition, which is a common theme in biblical narratives. The passage of time often sets the stage for new developments or divine interventions.<p><b>Judah&#8217;s wife, the daughter of Shua, died.</b><br>The mention of Judah's wife as the daughter of Shua highlights her Canaanite origin, which is significant given the patriarchal emphasis on marrying within the covenant community. Her death marks a turning point in Judah's life, leading to subsequent events that will have lasting implications for his family line. This also reflects the transient nature of life and relationships, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>When Judah had finished mourning,</b><br>The mourning period was a culturally significant time in ancient Near Eastern societies, often involving specific rituals and customs. This phrase indicates that Judah observed the traditional period of mourning, which underscores the importance of family and community in the grieving process. Mourning customs are also seen in other biblical accounts, such as the mourning for Jacob (<a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>).<p><b>he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite</b><br>Hirah is mentioned as a friend of Judah, indicating a close relationship. The term "Adullamite" refers to someone from Adullam, a city in the Shephelah region of Judah. This friendship may suggest alliances or social connections outside of Judah's immediate family, which could have implications for his decisions and actions. The presence of Hirah in the narrative highlights the role of companionship and influence in personal choices.<p><b>went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah.</b><br>Sheepshearing was a significant economic and social event in ancient times, often associated with festivity and celebration. Timnah, located in the hill country of Judah, serves as the geographical setting for the unfolding events. This journey to Timnah sets the stage for the encounter with Tamar, which will have profound implications for Judah's lineage. The act of sheepshearing is also mentioned in other biblical contexts, such as in the story of David and Nabal (1 Samuel 25), indicating its importance in the agrarian society of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this account.

As it lay, however, only about seven miles beyond Adullam, and as the flocks there were Judah's private property (<a href="/genesis/38-13.htm" title="And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold your father in law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.">Genesis 38:13</a>), and under the charge of Hirah, this remoter place, now called Tibneh, is probably the Timnath meant, as at Bethlehem the pastures were occupied by his father. (See also <a href="/genesis/38-14.htm" title="And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him to wife.">Genesis 38:14</a>.) For the sheep-shearing, see <a href="/genesis/31-19.htm" title="And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's.">Genesis 31:19</a>. Instead of "his friend Hirah," the LXX. and Vulg. render <span class= "ital">his shepherd Hirah. </span>This would require no change in the consonants, but only in the vowels. Most of the other authorities agree with the Authorised Version; but even so, there was most probably some partnership between Judah and Hirah in these flocks, and they would be under Hirah's charge whenever Judah was absent, tending the flocks of his father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in process of time</span> - <span class="accented">literally, and the days were multiplied</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3</a>), which is rendered by the same words in the A.V. - <span class="cmt_word">the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted</span> (or, comforted himself, ceased to mourn), <span class="cmt_word">and went up unto his sheep-shearers</span> (vide <a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to Timnath</span>, - a border town between Ekron and Bethshemesh (<a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a>) in the plain of Judah (Kalisch, Wordsworth, W.
