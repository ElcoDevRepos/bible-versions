The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, as seen in the seven days of creation. This period of abundance was a divine provision, allowing for preparation before the subsequent famine.<p><b>Joseph collected all the excess food</b><br>Joseph's role as a wise administrator is highlighted here. His actions demonstrate foresight and stewardship, qualities that are valued throughout Scripture. This collection of excess food is a practical application of the principle of storing up in times of plenty to prepare for times of need, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a> with the example of the ant.<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a significant nation in biblical history, was known for its fertile land, particularly around the Nile River. This abundance was a result of the Nile's annual flooding, which enriched the soil. Egypt's role as a place of refuge and provision is seen throughout the Bible, such as when Abraham and later Jacob's family sought sustenance there.<p><b>and stored it in the cities</b><br>The storage of food in cities indicates a centralized system of management and distribution. This method ensured that resources were available where populations were concentrated, reflecting an organized and strategic approach to governance. This centralization can be seen as a precursor to later systems of governance and resource management.<p><b>In every city he laid up the food</b><br>Joseph's systematic approach ensured that each city had its own supply, reducing the risk of famine-related migration and unrest. This strategy reflects wisdom in leadership and planning, ensuring local access to resources. It also foreshadows the importance of local church communities in the New Testament, where resources and support are shared among believers.<p><b>from the fields around it</b><br>The mention of fields highlights the agrarian society of ancient Egypt, where agriculture was the backbone of the economy. The fields' productivity during the years of plenty was a direct fulfillment of God's promise of abundance. This agricultural imagery is often used in Scripture to describe spiritual truths, such as sowing and reaping in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who, through God's providence, rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
