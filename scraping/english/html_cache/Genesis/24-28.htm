In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, running was not a common activity for women, indicating the importance of the message she carried. Her eagerness reflects the significance of the encounter with Abraham's servant, who was seeking a wife for Isaac, Abraham's son. This moment is pivotal in the unfolding of God's covenant promises to Abraham, as it sets the stage for the continuation of his lineage.<p><b>and told her mother&#8217;s household</b><br>Rebekah's decision to inform her mother's household is significant. In patriarchal societies, the father's household typically held authority, but the mention of the mother's household suggests a matrilineal influence or simply the domestic sphere where women communicated. This detail may also indicate the close-knit nature of family units and the role of women in managing household affairs. It reflects the cultural norms of the time, where women often gathered and shared news within their domestic circles.<p><b>about these things</b><br>The phrase "these things" refers to the events that had just transpired at the well, including the servant's prayer, Rebekah's fulfillment of the sign he requested from God, and the gifts she received. This moment is a fulfillment of divine providence, as God orchestrates the meeting to ensure the continuation of Abraham's lineage through Isaac. The narrative connects to other scriptural themes of God's faithfulness and guidance, as seen in stories like those of Joseph and Moses. It also foreshadows the role of women in God's plan, as Rebekah becomes a matriarch in the lineage leading to Jesus Christ, fulfilling the Abrahamic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman from the household of Bethuel, who is the daughter of Bethuel and the granddaughter of Nahor, Abraham's brother.

She has just drawn water for Abraham&#8217;s servant and watched God answer his prayer right before her eyes (<a href="/genesis/24-17.htm">Genesis 24:17&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Running signals eagerness and joy, much like Abraham &#8220;ran to the herd&#8221; when hosting the angels (<a href="/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7</a>) or David who &#8220;ran quickly toward the battle line&#8221; in faith (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>).<p>&#8226; The momentum of obedience often follows moments of revelation. Mary &#8220;got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah&#8221; after hearing the angel&#8217;s word (<a href="/luke/1-39.htm">Luke 1:39</a>). Rebekah&#8217;s feet move because her spirit is already convinced that something extraordinary is unfolding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told her mother&#8217;s household</b><p>Rather than heading to her father Bethuel or her brother Laban in private, Rebekah shares the account openly with the women&#8217;s quarters of the home.<p>&#8226; Scripture frequently notes the mother&#8217;s household as a relational hub (<a href="/ruth/1-8.htm">Ruth 1:8</a>; Song of Songs 3:4). Here it provides a setting for family discernment and hospitality.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a> repeatedly shows women at the center of God&#8217;s covenant story&#8212;Sarah&#8217;s tent (v. 67), Rebekah&#8217;s mother and brother negotiating her departure (vv. 55&#8211;60). God honors family structures while advancing His promises.<p>&#8226; This moment also underscores accountability. By relaying the events to those closest to her, Rebekah ensures the report can be tested and confirmed (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about these things</b><p>The phrase gathers everything&#8212;from the servant&#8217;s prayer to the lavish gifts (<a href="/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 26</a>&#8211;27). Rebekah becomes the first witness of what God has done.<p>&#8226; Her testimony mirrors other spontaneous proclamations: the shepherds who &#8220;made known the statement that had been told them&#8221; (<a href="/luke/2-17.htm">Luke 2:17</a>) and the Samaritan woman who &#8220;left her water jar&#8221; to announce Christ (<a href="/john/4-28.htm">John 4:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s works are meant to be verbalized. &#8220;My mouth will tell of Your righteousness, of Your salvation all day long&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/71-15.htm">Psalm 71:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant will soon confirm her words (<a href="/genesis/24-34.htm">Genesis 24:34-49</a>), illustrating how personal witness and communal verification work together to recognize God&#8217;s leading.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-28.htm">Genesis 24:28</a> spotlights Rebekah&#8217;s immediate, enthusiastic response to God&#8217;s activity.

The verse invites us to move quickly in obedience, bring God&#8217;s works into our closest circles, and openly testify to His unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">The damsel ran, and told (them of) her mother's house.</span>--The words inserted in italics are worse than useless.
