This highlights the respect and agency given to Rebekah in this narrative. The calling of Rebekah signifies a pivotal moment where her personal consent is sought, reflecting the importance of her willingness in the fulfillment of God's covenantal promises. This moment also underscores the role of divine providence in the selection of Isaac's wife, as Rebekah's decision aligns with God's plan.<p><b>&#8220;Will you go with this man?&#8221;</b><br>The question posed to Rebekah is significant as it involves leaving her family and homeland to marry Isaac, whom she has never met. This mirrors the call of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, where he was asked to leave his country and family to follow God's promise. The phrase "this man" refers to Abraham's servant, who represents Abraham and, by extension, God's will. This question tests Rebekah's faith and willingness to trust in God's plan, much like the faith demonstrated by Abraham.<p><b>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; she replied.</b><br>Rebekah's response is a testament to her faith and courage. Her willingness to go reflects a parallel to the obedience and faith of Abraham, who also responded to God's call without knowing the full details of his journey. This act of faith is a precursor to the faith required of the Israelites and later believers, who are called to trust in God's promises. Rebekah's decision is also a type of the church, the bride of Christ, who willingly follows Christ, the bridegroom, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>. Her response is a pivotal moment in the Abrahamic narrative, ensuring the continuation of the covenant through Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>- A young woman from the family of Abraham's brother Nahor, chosen to be Isaac's wife.

Scripture repeatedly shows God working through family summons&#8212;think of Samuel being called by Eli (<a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8</a>) or David being called from the fields (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The call confirms Rebekah&#8217;s value and dignity; she is not traded like property but personally engaged, echoing God&#8217;s pattern of calling individuals by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And asked her</b><p>&#8226; The servant has presented clear evidence that the Lord has guided him (<a href="/genesis/24-48.htm">Genesis 24:48-49</a>).

Joshua used the same pattern&#8212;after recounting God&#8217;s deeds he still said, &#8220;Choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The invitation honors her free will, mirroring the way Jesus later asked two disciples, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Will you go with this man?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question is specific: leave Haran immediately to become Isaac&#8217;s wife in Canaan.<p>&#8226; Similar decisive invitations appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8209; Ruth faced, &#8220;Will you go with Naomi?&#8221; and replied, &#8220;Where you go I will go&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>).<p>&#8209; Jesus said to Peter and Andrew, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It is also a test of faith in unseen promises, much like Abraham went &#8220;not knowing where he was going&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; she replied</b><p>&#8226; Without hesitation, Rebekah aligns herself with God&#8217;s unfolding covenant plan (<a href="/genesis/24-60.htm">Genesis 24:60</a>).<p>&#8226; Her swift &#8220;Yes&#8221; parallels Mary&#8217;s &#8220;I am the Lord&#8217;s servant&#8230;May it be to me as you have said&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedient response brings blessing: Rebekah becomes matriarch of Israel, fulfilling God&#8217;s word to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Her journey anticipates the believer&#8217;s response to Christ&#8212;leaving the old life and pressing forward toward promised joys (<a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-58.htm">Genesis 24:58</a> records the pivotal moment when Rebekah freely chooses to step into God&#8217;s redemptive story.
