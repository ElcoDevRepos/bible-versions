The struggle between them is significant as it foreshadows the future conflict between their descendants, the Edomites and Israelites. This prenatal struggle symbolizes the ongoing tension and rivalry that will characterize their relationship. The Hebrew word used for "struggled" can imply a violent or intense conflict, indicating the depth of the discord. This struggle is also a precursor to the prophecy given to Rebekah about the two nations that will come from her sons, highlighting the divine orchestration of events even before their birth.<p><b>and she said, &#8220;Why is this happening to me?&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah's question reflects her distress and confusion over the unusual and intense movement within her womb. In the cultural context of the time, such a struggle might have been seen as an omen or a sign of something significant. Her question indicates a personal and emotional response, seeking understanding of her situation. It also shows her awareness of the unusual nature of her pregnancy, prompting her to seek divine insight. This moment of questioning is a common human experience, reflecting a desire to understand God's purpose in difficult circumstances.<p><b>So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD</b><br>Rebekah's decision to seek the LORD demonstrates her faith and reliance on God for answers. In the patriarchal narratives, seeking divine guidance was a common practice, often through prayer or consulting a prophet. This act of inquiring suggests a personal relationship with God and a belief in His ability to provide wisdom and revelation. It also sets a precedent for seeking God's will in times of uncertainty. The LORD's response to Rebekah's inquiry reveals His sovereign plan and the future roles of her sons, emphasizing the theme of divine election and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

Not by Urim (Bohlen), since this method of inquiring at the Deity did not then exist (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>); but either through a prophet, - Shem (Luther), Melchisedeck (Jewish interpreters), Heber (Lyra); more likely Abraham (Grotius, Ainsworth, Wordsworth, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary'), or Isaac, the prophet nearest her (Lange), - or through herself by prayer, as in <a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a> (Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Lange, Murphy, Inglis). The language seems to imply that by this time there was a regularly-appointed place for the worship of God by prayer and sacrifice - Theodoret suggests the family altar; Delitzsch, Hagar's well. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/25-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
