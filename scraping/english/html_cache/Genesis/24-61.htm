In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, such readiness reflects obedience and trust. Rebekah's decision to leave her family and homeland mirrors the call of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, where he was called to leave his country and go to a land God would show him. This act of faith is a precursor to the Christian call to follow Christ, leaving behind the old life for a new one.<p><b>mounted the camels</b><br>Camels were a sign of wealth and were used for long-distance travel across the desert. This detail highlights the prosperity of Abraham's household and the provision made for Rebekah's journey. The use of camels also underscores the significant distance between Haran and Canaan, emphasizing the commitment and sacrifice involved in Rebekah's decision. In a typological sense, the camels can be seen as a means of grace, carrying Rebekah to her new life, much like how believers are carried by grace to their new life in Christ.<p><b>and followed the man</b><br>Rebekah's action of following the servant, who represents Abraham, is symbolic of discipleship and submission to God's will. This mirrors the call to follow Christ, as seen in <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>, where Jesus calls His disciples to follow Him. The servant, acting on behalf of Abraham, can be seen as a type of the Holy Spirit, who leads and guides believers to Christ, the bridegroom.<p><b>So the servant took Rebekah and left</b><br>This final phrase signifies the beginning of a new chapter in Rebekah's life, as she leaves her past behind to become the wife of Isaac. It reflects the biblical theme of leaving and cleaving, as stated in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>, where a man leaves his father and mother to be united with his wife. The servant's role in taking Rebekah can be seen as a parallel to the Holy Spirit's role in preparing the Church, the bride of Christ, for the heavenly bridegroom. This journey is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to find a wife for Isaac, ensuring the continuation of the covenant lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A key figure in this passage, Rebekah is the daughter of Bethuel and the future wife of Isaac. Her willingness to leave her family and homeland demonstrates her faith and obedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/maidservants.htm">Maidservants</a></b><br>These are the women who accompanied Rebekah on her journey. Their presence signifies the importance and status of Rebekah as she transitions to her new life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>This is Abraham's servant, often identified as Eliezer, who was tasked with finding a wife for Isaac. His faithfulness and dedication to his master's mission are evident throughout the chapter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/camels.htm">Camels</a></b><br>The mode of transportation for Rebekah and her entourage, camels symbolize wealth and the provision of God for a successful journey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_journey.htm">The Journey</a></b><br>This event marks the beginning of Rebekah's journey from her home in Paddan Aram to Canaan, where she will become Isaac's wife, continuing the Abrahamic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_obedience.htm">Faithful Obedience</a></b><br>Rebekah's readiness to leave her family and homeland is a powerful example of obedience to God's will.

She trusts that the God who arranged this meeting will also guide the journey.<p>&#8226; Jesus commends the vigilant servant who is &#8220;dressed for service&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35</a>), echoing the attitude seen here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Mounted the camels</b><p>&#8226; By climbing onto the camels provided by Abraham&#8217;s servant (<a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>), Rebekah embraces the means God has supplied.<p>&#8226; Camels signify a long, demanding trek across deserts; her willingness foreshadows believers who count the cost yet go forward (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a> mentions caravans of camels bringing treasures to Zion, hinting at God&#8217;s use of humble transport to carry out grand purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Followed the man</b><p>&#8226; Rebekah physically follows the servant, a type of the Holy Spirit guiding believers to the Son. Just as the servant&#8217;s mission is to bring a bride to Isaac, the Spirit draws the church to Christ (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Her immediate obedience mirrors Ruth&#8217;s pledge to Naomi: &#8220;Where you go I will go&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This following is not blind; it rests on the servant&#8217;s testimony of God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/genesis/24-34.htm">Genesis 24:34&#8211;49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the servant took Rebekah and left</b><p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s leadership continues; he assumes responsibility for safely delivering her to Isaac, reflecting God&#8217;s faithful shepherding (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebekah&#8217;s departure severs old ties and begins a covenantal future.
