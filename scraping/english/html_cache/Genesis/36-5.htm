The names Jeush, Jalam, and Korah are significant as they represent the continuation of Esau's line, which would become the Edomites. These names are not as prominent in biblical narratives as Jacob's descendants, indicating the lesser focus on Esau's line in the biblical story. The mention of these sons underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations, as Esau's descendants became a distinct nation.<p><b>These were the sons of Esau,</b><br>Esau, also known as Edom, is a central figure in the narrative of Genesis. His descendants, the Edomites, play a significant role in the history of Israel, often as adversaries. The mention of his sons here serves to establish the genealogical record of Esau's lineage, which is important for understanding the broader narrative of the Old Testament, where the Edomites frequently interact with the Israelites. This genealogy also highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in the unfolding of history, as Esau's line, though not the chosen line of promise, is still significant in the biblical narrative.<p><b>who were born to him in the land of Canaan.</b><br>The land of Canaan is a significant geographical and theological setting in the Bible. It is the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, and its mention here situates Esau's family within the broader context of God's promises. Although Esau's descendants would eventually settle in the region of Seir, their birth in Canaan ties them to the land of promise, albeit temporarily. This phrase also serves to contrast Esau's temporary presence in Canaan with Jacob's eventual inheritance of the land, emphasizing the theme of divine election and promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oholibamah.htm">Oholibamah</a></b><br>One of Esau's wives, a Hittite woman, who bore him three sons.

Evidently he had taken Aholibamah home thither, and she had borne him three sons. After Isaac's death the land of Seir had so great attractions for him that he migrated thither with his share of Isaac's wealth, and left Hebron to Jacob, who now moved down thither from the town of Eder, and took possession of the homestead of his fathers. And thus the inheritance of the birthright came finally to Jacob by. Esau's own act, and would doubtless have so come to him; only his father's blessing and the transference to him of the Abrahamic promises would have been given him, not at the time of Isaac's temporary illness, but on his deathbed.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/36-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and Oholibamah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;&#1459;&#1500;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1489;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;ho&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
