Canaan, the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, is significant as the backdrop for much of the patriarchal narratives. Jacob, also known as Israel, is the father of the twelve tribes, and his presence in Canaan underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. The return to Canaan after their journey to Egypt highlights the ongoing tension between the land of promise and the land of provision, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible.<p><b>they described to him all that had happened to them:</b><br>This phrase indicates a moment of revelation and communication. The brothers recount their experiences in Egypt, which includes their encounter with Joseph, whom they do not recognize. This moment is pivotal as it sets the stage for the eventual reconciliation and fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). The act of describing their experiences also reflects the importance of oral tradition in ancient cultures, where stories and events were passed down verbally.
