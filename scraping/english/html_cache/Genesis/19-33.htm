The use of wine to intoxicate Lot reflects a recurring biblical theme where alcohol leads to poor judgment, as seen in Noah's story (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>). The cultural context of the time placed a high value on lineage and progeny, which may have driven the daughters' actions. The setting is in a cave near Zoar, a place of refuge after fleeing the destruction, indicating isolation and fear of extinction.<p><b>and the firstborn went in and slept with her father</b><br>The act of incest here is a direct violation of later Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-7</a>), illustrating the absence of divine guidance in Lot's family post-Sodom. This event foreshadows the birth of the Moabites and Ammonites, who become adversaries of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3-4</a>). The narrative underscores the consequences of living in a morally corrupt environment, as Lot's daughters resort to extreme measures to preserve their family line.<p><b>he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up</b><br>Lot's lack of awareness due to intoxication emphasizes his vulnerability and the complete control his daughters had over the situation. This detail serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of drunkenness, which can lead to sin and unintended consequences. The phrase also highlights the theme of deception found throughout Genesis, such as Jacob deceiving Isaac (<a href="/genesis/27-18.htm">Genesis 27:18-29</a>). The lack of awareness can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual blindness, contrasting with the vigilance required of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, Lot is a central figure in this account.
