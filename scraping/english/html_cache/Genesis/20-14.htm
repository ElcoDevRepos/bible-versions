Abimelech's gift of sheep and cattle to Abraham signifies a gesture of reconciliation and respect. This act reflects the cultural practice of making amends through substantial gifts, which is seen in other biblical narratives, such as Jacob's gifts to Esau in <a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-15</a>.<p><b>menservants and maidservants</b><br>The inclusion of servants in the gift highlights the wealth and status of Abimelech. Servants were valuable assets, contributing to the economic productivity of a household. This act of giving servants also indicates a transfer of resources and a sign of goodwill, ensuring that Abraham's household would be well-supported.<p><b>and he gave them to Abraham</b><br>This phrase underscores the transfer of wealth and resources from Abimelech to Abraham, signifying a formal resolution to the conflict. It also reflects the divine favor upon Abraham, as God had intervened on his behalf. This act of giving can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bless those who bless Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>and restored his wife Sarah to him</b><br>The restoration of Sarah to Abraham is a crucial element in the narrative, emphasizing the protection of the covenant promise that Sarah would bear a son. This act also rectifies the potential threat to the lineage through which the Messiah would come.
