Joseph, who had been sold into slavery by his brothers, now reveals his identity to them. The act of throwing his arms around Benjamin signifies reconciliation and forgiveness. Benjamin, Joseph's only full brother, represents a special bond, as they both were sons of Rachel. This embrace symbolizes the restoration of familial relationships and the breaking down of past animosities. The act of embracing is a common cultural expression of affection and reconciliation in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and wept</b><br>Joseph's weeping is a profound expression of his deep emotions. Throughout the Joseph narrative, weeping is a recurring theme, highlighting the human aspect of Joseph's character. His tears reflect a release of years of pent-up emotion, pain, and longing for his family. In biblical context, weeping often accompanies moments of significant personal and spiritual revelation, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>, where Jesus weeps at Lazarus's tomb, showing compassion and empathy.<p><b>and Benjamin wept as they embraced</b><br>Benjamin's weeping indicates his reciprocal affection and relief at the reunion with his brother. This mutual weeping underscores the sincerity of their reconciliation. The embrace and shared tears signify the healing of past wounds and the renewal of brotherly love. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where reconciliation and forgiveness are central themes. Just as Joseph forgives his brothers, Christ offers forgiveness and reconciliation to humanity. The embrace also prefigures the unity and restoration that Christ brings to believers, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>, where Christ is described as breaking down the dividing wall of hostility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The eleventh son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
