The mention of "chiefs" indicates a structured tribal leadership, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>). Esau's descendants, the Edomites, were a significant nation in the region.<p><b>according to their families and regions,</b><br>The organization by families and regions suggests a well-defined social and territorial structure. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of tribal governance, where leadership was often hereditary and linked to specific geographic areas. It highlights the importance of kinship and land in maintaining social order.<p><b>by their names:</b><br>Naming is significant in biblical texts, often reflecting character, destiny, or divine purpose. The specific mention of names underscores the historical reality of these figures and their roles in the Edomite society. Names in the Bible can also carry prophetic or symbolic meanings.<p><b>Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,</b><br>These names represent specific leaders within the Edomite hierarchy. Timna is also mentioned earlier as a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, indicating a possible matriarchal influence or alliance through marriage. Alvah and Jetheth are less known, but their inclusion signifies their importance in the tribal structure. The listing of these chiefs demonstrates the fulfillment of Esau's blessing by Isaac, where he was promised to live by the sword and serve his brother Jacob, yet eventually break free (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>). The chiefs' names also reflect the historical enmity and complex relationship between Israel and Edom throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The brother of Jacob, also known as Edom.

Much like Israel&#8217;s later tribal allotments (<a href="/bsb/joshua/19.htm">Joshua 19</a>), Edom&#8217;s structure reflects order and permanence.<p>- <a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a> reminds Israel that God had already &#8220;given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession,&#8221; explaining why these regions belonged to defined Edomite families.<p>- This arrangement satisfies God&#8217;s earlier promise to Abraham that &#8220;nations and kings will come from you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>). Even outside the covenant line, Abraham&#8217;s grandson enjoys real estate, governance, and growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by their names</b><p>- The text emphasizes personal names because leadership in the ancient Near East was inseparable from identity. Naming each chief stamps authenticity on the record, much as <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1</a> names Jacob&#8217;s sons to anchor Israel&#8217;s story.<p>- Names also preserve memory. Centuries later prophets could indict Edom for its hostility (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8-9</a>) by appealing to these same ancestral lines&#8212;proof that God holds nations accountable through time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth</b><p>- Timna, Alvah, and Jetheth represent distinct clans that settled south of the Dead Sea. Archaeology locates copper-rich Timna Valley within Edomite territory, hinting at why this chief may have held influence (<a href="/genesis/36-40.htm">Genesis 36:40</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>).<p>- Alvah (called Aliah in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>) and Jetheth are otherwise unknown to us, yet Scripture records them to show that no part of God&#8217;s plan is incidental.<p>- Their presence testifies that Esau&#8217;s house flourished into strong, named leaders long before Israel crowned Saul (<a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>), underscoring that divine timing, not human achievement, controls history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/36-40.htm">Genesis 36:40</a> is more than a genealogy footnote; it is a snapshot of God&#8217;s faithfulness to Esau, validating promises made generations earlier. By cataloging specific chiefs, linked to families and lands, Scripture affirms that Edom became an organized, settled nation. Every name declares that the Lord governs the rise of peoples, keeps precise records, and weaves even non-covenant lines into His unfolding redemptive story.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/36.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">According to their families, after their places.</span>--The final list of the dukes is said, both here and in <a href="/genesis/36-43.htm" title="Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites.">Genesis 36:43</a>, to be territorial, by which is meant, not that the persons mentioned were not real men, but that Edom finally settled down into eleven "thousands" named after these chieftains. So in Canaan the names of the sons of Jacob became those also of territorial divisions, two of which, however, were given to Joseph and his sons, while no district was called after Levi. What is remarkable here is the vast amount of change. No Horite duke gives his name to any of these divisions of the land of Edom. Omitting Korah from <a href="/genesis/36-16.htm" title="Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.">Genesis 36:16</a>, there were originally thirteen of these tribal princes, each with his own territory, but with no central government; just as the children of Israel dwelt for centuries in Canaan, each tribe independently in its own district, and with nothing to bind them together except their religion. In <a href="/context/genesis/36-40.htm" title="And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,">Genesis 36:40-43</a> we find eleven tribes, of which only two, those of Teman and Kenaz, retain the names of the sons of Esau, while of the rest we know nothing. We may, however, safely conclude that these nine persons, who gave their names to districts of Edom, were all men who rose to power during the troubled times when king after king seized the crown only to be displaced by some one else. Probably many such men arose, but these were all who consolidated their power sufficiently to leave their names behind them. Amidst this anarchy, the two districts of Teman and Kenaz alone remained unbroken, and continued to be ruled by princes of the same family. This word "family" has in Hebrew a meaning different from that which it has with us; for it signifies one of the larger divisions of a tribe, of which the subdivisions are called "fathers' houses," which again are subdivided into households (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm" title="Take you the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls;">Numbers 1:2</a>, &c.).
