In the context of Genesis, God often speaks directly to the patriarchs, establishing a covenantal relationship. This reflects the intimate relationship between God and Abraham, highlighting Abraham's role as a prophet (<a href="/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>) and a friend of God (<a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>).<p><b>Shall I hide from Abraham</b><br>Here, God deliberates whether to reveal His plans to Abraham, underscoring Abraham's unique position as a covenant partner. This reflects the biblical theme of God sharing His plans with His chosen servants (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). It also foreshadows the role of prophets who are privy to divine counsel. The rhetorical question suggests God's intention to involve Abraham in His redemptive plan.<p><b>what I am about to do?</b><br>This refers to God's impending judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, which is a significant event in biblical history. The destruction of these cities serves as a warning against sin and a demonstration of divine justice. It also prefigures the final judgment, drawing parallels to eschatological themes found in the New Testament (<a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>, <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>).
