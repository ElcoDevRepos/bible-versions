Lot's daughters, having fled with him to the mountains, believed they were the last people on earth. This reflects the isolation and desperation they felt, which led to their drastic actions. The daughters' decision can be seen as a reflection of the moral decay they witnessed in Sodom, influencing their judgment and actions.<p><b>became pregnant</b><br>The pregnancies of Lot's daughters resulted from their plan to preserve their family line, which they executed by intoxicating their father. This act of desperation highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in ancient cultures, where continuing one's family line was a significant concern. The pregnancies also set the stage for the birth of Moab and Ben-Ammi, who would become the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites, respectively. These nations would later have complex relationships with Israel, often characterized by conflict and enmity.<p><b>by their father</b><br>The phrase underscores the incestuous nature of the daughters' actions, which is condemned in later biblical law (<a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-18</a>). This incident serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of living in a morally corrupt environment and the importance of maintaining faith and righteousness. The story also foreshadows the future interactions between the descendants of Lot and the Israelites, as the Moabites and Ammonites would play significant roles in Israel's history. Despite the sinful origins, God's sovereignty is evident as He uses even flawed human actions to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, Lot is a central figure in this account.
