Jared's age at the time of Enoch's birth reflects the extended lifespans before the Flood, which some interpret as a sign of a different pre-Flood environment. This longevity is often seen as a testament to the vitality of early humanity and the effects of sin on creation over time. Jared's age also fits into the broader genealogical framework that connects Adam to Noah, underscoring the continuity of God's plan through generations.<p><b>he became the father of Enoch</b><br>Enoch is a significant figure in biblical history, known for his close relationship with God. Unlike others in the genealogy, Enoch's life is marked by his "walk with God," and he is one of only two people in the Bible who did not experience death, the other being Elijah. Enoch's life prefigures the concept of eternal life and the hope of resurrection. His story is further expanded in the New Testament, where he is mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a> as an example of faith.

It is probable from this that Enoch was not the eldest son, but that the birthright became his because of his special excellencies.
