Apparently Rebekah was then dead, and Jacob brought back Deborah with him. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/33-18.htm" title="And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.">Genesis 33:18</a>.) How dear she was to them is shown by their calling the tree under which she was buried <span class= "ital">the oak of weeping. </span>This oak was "beneath Beth-el," that is, in the valley below it. Deborah must have died at a great age, for she gave Rebekah suck, and must therefore have been grown up at her birth. Now Jacob, when he returned from Padan-aram, was ninety-seven years of age; and as he was born twenty years after his mother's marriage--if we allow the shortest possible space for the interval spent at Succoth and Shechem--Deborah must have been nearly one hundred and sixty years of age. This again confirms the conclusion that Dinah's dishonour occurred very soon after the arrival of Jacob at Shechem. (See Note on <a href="/genesis/34-1.htm" title="And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.">Genesis 34:1</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Deborah</span> - Bee (Gesenius, Furst) <span class="cmt_word">Rebekah's nurse</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/24-59.htm">Genesis 24:59</a>) <span class="cmt_word">died</span> - at a very advanced age, having left Padan-aram for Canaan along with Rebekah, upwards of 150 years ago.
