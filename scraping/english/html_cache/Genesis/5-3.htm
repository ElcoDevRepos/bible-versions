The long lifespans in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> are often seen as a reflection of the pre-Flood world, where conditions may have been different. This age also suggests a significant period of time had passed since the creation and the events of <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3 and 4</a>, allowing for the population to grow and for Cain's descendants to establish their own lineage.<p><b>he had a son in his own likeness, after his own image</b><br>This phrase echoes the language of <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>, where God creates man in His own image. Here, the transmission of the image is from Adam to Seth, indicating the continuation of the human race and the inherent dignity and value of human life. It also suggests the fallen nature of humanity, as Seth inherits not only the image of God but also the marred image due to Adam's sin. This concept of likeness and image is foundational for understanding human identity and the need for redemption.<p><b>and he named him Seth</b><br>The naming of Seth is significant as it marks the continuation of the godly line through which the promise of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> would be fulfilled. Seth's name means "appointed" or "granted," reflecting Eve's recognition of God's provision after the loss of Abel. This lineage is crucial for the unfolding of redemptive history, as it leads to Noah and eventually to Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to bring salvation to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, living in the Garden of Eden before the Fall. He is a central figure in the genealogy of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/seth.htm">Seth</a></b><br>The third son of Adam and Eve, born after Cain and Abel. Seth is significant as the ancestor through whom the godly line continues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/likeness_and_image.htm">Likeness and Image</a></b><br>These terms refer to the resemblance and characteristics passed from Adam to Seth, echoing the language used in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a> about humanity being made in God's image.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_continuation_of_god's_plan.htm">The Continuation of God's Plan</a></b><br>Despite the Fall and the sin of Cain, God&#8217;s plan for humanity continues through Seth.

"A supernatural remedy does not prevent generation from participating in the corruption of sin. Therefore, according to the flesh Seth was born a sinner, though he was afterwards renewed by the Spirit of grace" (Calvin). The doctrine of inherited depravity or transmitted sin has been commonly held to favor the theory which accounts for the origin of the human soul <span class="accented">per traducem</span> (Tertullian, Luther, Delitzsch), in opposition to that which holds it to be due to the creative power of God (Jerome, Augustine, Calvin, Beza, Turretin). Kalisch thinks the statement "Adam begat Seth in his own image ' decisive in favor of Traducianism, while Hodge affirms "it only asserts that Seth was like his father, and sheds no light, on the mysterious process of generation ('Syst. Theol.,' Part I. <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. &sect; 2).

At the same time the lateness of paternity among these primeval men may have been partly due to a physical cause as well, "since in exact accordance with the increasing degeneracy and rankness of human life is there, in a literal sense, the increase of a numerous and wretched offspring" (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">And all the days that Adam</span> - not the whole tribe (Gatterer, <span class="accented">vide</span> Bohlen; cf.
