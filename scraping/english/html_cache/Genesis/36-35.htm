Husham's death signifies the end of his reign, which is part of the genealogical and historical record of Esau's descendants. The Edomite kingship was not hereditary, as seen in the frequent changes in leadership.<p><b>Hadad son of Bedad</b><br>Hadad is a common name in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often associated with a storm god. This Hadad is identified as the son of Bedad, indicating a lineage that may have been significant in Edomite society. The mention of his father suggests a continuation of a family line that held power or influence.<p><b>who defeated Midian in the country of Moab</b><br>This victory over Midian highlights Hadad's military prowess and the geopolitical dynamics of the region. Midian and Moab were neighboring territories, and conflicts among these groups were common. This victory would have elevated Hadad's status and solidified his rule. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah, and their interactions with Israel are noted in other biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-25</a>.<p><b>reigned in his place</b><br>Hadad's ascension to the throne indicates a peaceful transition of power, which was not always the case in ancient monarchies. This phrase underscores the stability of Edomite governance during this period, despite the frequent changes in leadership.<p><b>And the name of his city was Avith</b><br>Avith is identified as Hadad's city, suggesting it was his capital or a significant center of his rule. The exact location of Avith is uncertain, but it reflects the practice of naming cities after prominent leaders or events.
