In ancient times, oaths were often sworn by something greater than oneself, but God swears by Himself, indicating His supreme authority and the unchangeable nature of His word. This is a rare occurrence in Scripture, highlighting the importance of the promise. <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-14</a> references this event, underscoring the reliability of God's promises. The use of "declares the LORD" affirms the divine origin and authority of the statement.<p><b>that because you have done this</b><br>This refers to Abraham's obedience in the near-sacrifice of Isaac, demonstrating his faith and trust in God. This act is pivotal in Abraham's life, showcasing his willingness to surrender everything to God. <a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21-23</a> cites this event as evidence of Abraham's faith being made complete by his actions. It serves as a model of faith in action, illustrating the principle that true faith results in obedience.<p><b>and have not withheld your only son,</b><br>Isaac is referred to as Abraham's "only son," emphasizing the depth of Abraham's sacrifice. Although Abraham had another son, Ishmael, Isaac is the son of promise through whom God's covenant would be fulfilled. This phrase foreshadows the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God's only Son, drawing a parallel between Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac and God's provision of His Son for humanity's redemption. <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> reflects this ultimate act of love and sacrifice.

By swearing on Himself, the Lord guarantees the blessings that will follow. Abraham&#8217;s obedience&#8212;demonstrated by not withholding his only son&#8212;becomes the immediate occasion for God&#8217;s sworn promise, foreshadowing the even greater gift of the Father who did not spare His own Son for our sake.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord</span> <span class= "bld">(Jehovah).</span>--This solemn interposition of an oath (<a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm" title="Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:">Hebrews 6:17</a>), of which the present is the sole instance in Holy Scripture, plainly indicates that this trial of Abraham's faith was of no common kind, and that its typical teaching is of no ordinary value. Abraham might have appealed to God's own attributes, and said, Far be it from thee, Lord, to command a human sacrifice, and bid a father slay his son. He might have pleaded the promises bound up with Isaac's life. But no, as soon as he is convinced that the command comes from God. he obeys, and, against hope, still believes that the promises will all be fulfilled in the sacrificed Isaac. He is thus the highest and most perfect example of faith, and by his offering of his son the Church received the assurance that the Son of God incarnate in the flesh would upon that very mountain offer the sacrifice Divinely necessary for the pardon of man's sins.<p>The blessing now given to Abraham differs from those that precede it in three particulars. First, it is no longer a promise, but a solemn compact ratified by an oath. Next, it assures Abraham's seed of victory, whereby the spiritual Israel is certified of the ultimate triumph of the Gospel. Lastly, it transfers to Abraham's offspring the promise of being the means of blessedness to all mankind.<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/22-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">saying,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
