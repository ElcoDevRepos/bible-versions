Reu is part of the line leading to Abraham, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to Noah to repopulate the earth. The genealogies in Genesis serve to connect the early patriarchs to the later narratives of Israel, showing God's ongoing plan for humanity. The mention of Reu also underscores the importance of family and lineage in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where ancestry determined social and religious identity.<p><b>Peleg lived 209 years</b><br>The lifespan of Peleg, like those of other early patriarchs, reflects the gradual decrease in human longevity post-Flood, a theme seen throughout Genesis. This decline in lifespan can be interpreted as a result of the increasing effects of sin on creation. Peleg's name, meaning "division," is significant as it is during his lifetime that the earth was divided, possibly referring to the division of languages at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). This division marks a pivotal moment in human history, leading to the dispersion of peoples and the formation of distinct nations.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Peleg, like many patriarchs, had a large family, which was typical in ancient times for ensuring the survival and prosperity of one's lineage. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests that the biblical narrative focuses on specific individuals for theological reasons, rather than providing an exhaustive genealogical record. This selective focus highlights the line through which God's redemptive plan unfolds, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ, who is traced back to these patriarchs in the genealogies of the Gospels (Matthew 1, <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/serug.htm">Serug</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, Serug is part of the genealogy leading to Abraham. His life and lineage are significant in the biblical account as they connect the post-flood generations to the patriarchs.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahor.htm">Nahor</a></b><br>The son of Serug, Nahor is an ancestor of Abraham. His name is carried on by his grandson, who is also named Nahor, further emphasizing the importance of this family line.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/genealogy.htm">Genealogy</a></b><br>This verse is part of the genealogical record in <a href="/bsb/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, which traces the lineage from Shem to Abram (later Abraham).

This steady shortening of lifespans fulfills God&#8217;s earlier word in <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a> that human years would dwindle.<p>&#8226; Even at 209 years, Peleg enjoyed a life long enough to pass along a rich testimony of God&#8217;s faithfulness, much as later patriarchs did (<a href="/genesis/25-7.htm">Genesis 25:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had other sons and daughters</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and had other sons and daughters.&#8221;

(<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The text does not name these children, underscoring that the inspired record focuses on the chosen line while still affirming the full, literal family tree (<a href="/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-18.htm">1 Chronicles 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Each unnamed son or daughter helped populate the earth, setting the stage for the dispersion described earlier in Peleg&#8217;s own lifetime&#8212;&#8220;in his days the earth was divided&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-19.htm">Genesis 11:19</a> serves three purposes: (1) it anchors Reu&#8212;and therefore Abraham&#8212;in a reliable, historical lineage; (2) it records Peleg&#8217;s literal 209-year lifespan as part of the gradual post-Flood decline in human longevity; and (3) it testifies that God&#8217;s mandate to multiply continued through &#8220;other sons and daughters.&#8221; Together, these details reinforce the trustworthiness of Scripture&#8217;s genealogies and spotlight God&#8217;s faithful preservation of the messianic line.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/11-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had become the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124;
