The inquiry about Sarah by name is significant, as it demonstrates the visitors' supernatural knowledge. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, women often remained in the background during male visitors' presence, which makes the direct question about Sarah unusual and highlights her importance in the unfolding narrative. This moment foreshadows the promise of a son, Isaac, and the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham. The mention of Sarah by name also emphasizes her role in God's plan, as she is to be the mother of nations (<a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16</a>).<p><b>they asked.</b><br>The plural form "they" indicates that all three visitors are involved in the conversation, though one of them, often interpreted as the Lord, takes the lead in the dialogue. This interaction is part of a theophany, where God appears in human form. The presence of these visitors is a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the announcement of Isaac's birth. The divine nature of the visitors is further confirmed by their knowledge and authority, which is consistent with other biblical theophanies, such as the appearance of the Angel of the Lord in various Old Testament passages.<p><b>&#8220;There, in the tent,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Abraham's response indicates Sarah's location within the tent, a typical dwelling structure of the time, reflecting the nomadic lifestyle of the patriarchs. The tent symbolizes domestic life and the private sphere, where women traditionally resided. This setting underscores the cultural norms of the period, where hospitality and the separation of gender roles were customary. The tent also serves as a backdrop for the miraculous announcement that follows, highlighting the contrast between the ordinary setting and the extraordinary promise of God. This moment is a precursor to the fulfillment of God's covenant, as Sarah's presence in the tent signifies her integral role in the divine plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, the Lord appears to Abraham in the form of three men.

God involves both spouses when revealing His plans.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they asked</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;They&#8221; refers to the three men who appeared in <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a>, one of whom is later identified as the LORD (18:13, 17).

God meets His people within their everyday, transient settings, not just grand sanctuaries (<a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48</a>).<p>&#8226; By directing attention to the tent, Abraham unknowingly sets the stage for the Lord to turn that commonplace space into a cradle of the covenant&#8217;s fulfillment (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he replied</b><p>&#8226; Abraham answers promptly and respectfully, modeling the ready obedience that characterized his walk since <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>, &#8220;So Abram went as the LORD had told him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His reply conveys transparency; nothing is hidden from the Lord&#8217;s sight (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The brief exchange exposes Sarah&#8217;s proximity to the conversation, ensuring she hears the forthcoming promise firsthand, just as Rebecca later overhears Isaac&#8217;s words in <a href="/genesis/27-5.htm">Genesis 27:5</a>, shaping covenant history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9</a> pivots the narrative from generous hospitality to divine revelation. The Lord singles out Sarah, affirming her indispensable role in the covenant. His question draws her into the promise of a son, transforming an ordinary tent into the birthplace of faith&#8217;s next chapter. Abraham&#8217;s straightforward answer displays trust and openness before God, demonstrating that when the Lord inquires, He is inviting His people into deeper partnership with His unfolding plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">They said.</span>--But in <a href="/genesis/18-10.htm" title="And he said, I will certainly return to you according to the time of life; and, see, Sarah your wife shall have a son.

The messenger speaks as one with Jehovah, or as being His representative.<p><span class= "bld">Where is Sarah thy wife?</span>--This question is contrary to Oriental manners, as the women may be referred to only in the most indirect manner. But during the meal Abraham, as he talked with the strangers, had probably begun to recognise in them something more than human.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said unto him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Principal One of the three, speaking for the others, interrogated Abraham during the progress, or perhaps at the close of, the meal saying), <span class="cmt_word">Where is Sarah thy wife?</span> (thus indicating that their visit had a special reference to her). <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, in the tent</span>. It is obvious that if at first Abraham regarded his visitors only as men, by this time a suspicion of their true character must have begun to dawn upon his mind. How should ordinary travelers be aware of his wife s name? and why should they do so unusual a thing, according to Oriental manners, as to inquire after her? If thus far their behavior could not fail to surprise the patriarch, what must have been his astonishment at the subsequent communication? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ay&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_346.htm">Strong's 346: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where?</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is your wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;te&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Sarah?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8283.htm">Strong's 8283: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sarah -- 'princess', a wife of Abraham</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;There,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the tent,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1462;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;hel)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_168.htm">Strong's 168: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he replied.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/18-9.htm">Genesis 18:9 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/18-9.htm">OT Law: Genesis 18:9 They said to him Where is Sarah (Gen.
