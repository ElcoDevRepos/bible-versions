Despite the malicious intent of his brothers, God had a sovereign plan. This reflects the biblical theme of God's providence, where He uses human actions, even those meant for harm, to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Joseph's role as a forerunner is a type of Christ, who was sent ahead to prepare the way for salvation (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-30</a>).<p><b>to preserve you as a remnant on the earth</b><br>The concept of a "remnant" is significant throughout Scripture, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God during times of judgment or calamity (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). Here, Joseph's position in Egypt ensures the survival of Jacob's family during the famine, preserving the lineage through which the Messiah would come. This preservation is a testament to God's covenantal faithfulness to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>and to save your lives</b><br>Joseph's role in saving his family from famine is a direct act of deliverance, prefiguring the ultimate salvation offered through Jesus Christ. Just as Joseph provided physical sustenance, Christ offers spiritual salvation (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). This deliverance also underscores the theme of redemption, where God rescues His people from peril.<p><b>by a great deliverance</b><br>The "great deliverance" refers to the extraordinary means by which God saved Jacob's family, ensuring the continuation of His covenant promises. This deliverance is not only physical but also spiritual, as it sets the stage for the eventual formation of the nation of Israel. It parallels the future deliverance of Israel from Egypt during the Exodus, another pivotal moment of salvation history (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Joseph is speaking to his brothers.
