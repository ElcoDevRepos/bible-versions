Egypt was a significant and powerful nation in the ancient world, known for its advanced civilization and wealth. Abram's journey to Egypt occurs during a time of famine in Canaan, highlighting the region's dependence on Egypt for sustenance. This journey foreshadows future events, such as the Israelites' eventual sojourn in Egypt and the Exodus. Egypt often symbolizes a place of refuge but also a place of potential danger and moral testing.<p><b>he said to his wife Sarai</b><br>Abram's relationship with Sarai is central to the narrative of Genesis. Sarai, later renamed Sarah, is a key figure in the Abrahamic covenant, as she is the mother of Isaac, the child of promise. This interaction between Abram and Sarai reveals the dynamics of their relationship and sets the stage for the unfolding of God's promises. It also reflects the patriarchal culture of the time, where husbands often made decisions for their families.<p><b>Look, I know that you are a beautiful woman</b><br>Sarai's beauty is emphasized here, which plays a crucial role in the events that follow. Her beauty is not only a personal attribute but also a narrative device that introduces tension and conflict. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, beauty could be both a blessing and a source of danger, as it might attract unwanted attention from powerful men. This acknowledgment of Sarai's beauty also connects to later biblical narratives where beauty plays a significant role, such as in the stories of Esther and Bathsheba.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (later Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

Like the later Israelites on the brink of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27&#8211;29</a>), he weighs earthly realities instead of divine promises. Yet the Lord has already pledged, &#8220;I will bless you&#8230; and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). The setting reminds us that God&#8217;s covenant travels with His people, even when surroundings look risky.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said to his wife Sarai</b><p>Marriage conversation frames the scene. Abram and Sarai stand together, but his words reveal tension between trust in God and self-preservation. Scripture consistently highlights the marital bond as a place where faith is tested and displayed (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). Abram&#8217;s speech will expose both his affection for Sarai and a troubling inclination to protect himself first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look</b><p>The term signals urgency. Abram is not idly chatting; he feels pressed to act. Similar moments appear when Lot says, &#8220;Look, I have two daughters&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-8.htm">Genesis 19:8</a>) or when Esau pleads, &#8220;Look, I am about to die&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-32.htm">Genesis 25:32</a>). Each &#8220;look&#8221; introduces a fork in the road where human reasoning can eclipse divine guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I know</b><p>Abram is certain about one thing&#8212;Sarai&#8217;s appearance&#8212;and uncertain about everything else. Certainty limited to the visible often breeds anxiety (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). God had already said, &#8220;I will show you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>); Abram replies, in effect, &#8220;I know.&#8221; Confidence rooted in observation can become a substitute for confidence rooted in revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you are a beautiful woman</b><p>Sarai&#8217;s beauty is real, not exaggerated; even the Egyptians will confirm it (<a href="/genesis/12-14.htm">Genesis 12:14-15</a>). Scripture never downplays physical attractiveness (see <a href="/esther/2-7.htm">Esther 2:7</a>) yet warns that it can invite peril (<a href="/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>). In Abram&#8217;s mind, beauty is both blessing and threat. Instead of entrusting that blessing to God, he schemes (<a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>). The episode previews later narratives where outward beauty intersects with danger&#8212;Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>, Rachel in <a href="/genesis/29-17.htm">Genesis 29:17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Faith and fear side by side</b><p>Abram&#8217;s fear does not erase his faith; it competes with it (<a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17</a>). Moments earlier he built an altar (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>); moments later he will compromise. Scripture candidly records saints who wrestle with mixed motives&#8212;Moses striking the rock (<a href="/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11-12</a>), Peter denying Christ (<a href="/luke/22-57.htm">Luke 22:57-62</a>). Such honesty assures believers that God works with imperfect people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God&#8217;s faithfulness despite compromise</b><p>Although this verse introduces Abram&#8217;s deceptive plan, the larger passage (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17-20</a>) shows the Lord intervening to protect Sarai and preserve the promise. Like <a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3</a> affirms, &#8220;He will not let your foot slip.&#8221; God acts, not because Abram deserves rescue, but because God&#8217;s covenant must stand (<a href="/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for believers today</b><p>&#8226; Detours test trust: external pressure can expose internal hesitation.<p>&#8226; Marriage conversations matter: words spoken in fear reverberate.<p>&#8226; Beauty is a gift to steward, not an excuse for manipulation.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises outlast our lapses; His discipline is protective, not punitive (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Walking by faith means letting revelation outrank calculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11</a> captures a pivotal heartbeat in Abram&#8217;s journey: the tension between trusting God&#8217;s promise and leaning on human strategy. His acknowledgment of Sarai&#8217;s beauty is accurate, yet his next steps reveal fear. The verse invites readers to recognize similar crossroads in their own lives, where the seen threatens to overshadow the spoken word of God. Even when faith falters, the Lord remains unwavering, moving history&#8212;and His people&#8212;toward the fulfillment of His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11-13) <span class= "bld">Thou art a fair woman.</span>--For the word y<span class= "ital">ephath, </span>rendered "fair," see on <a href="/genesis/9-27.htm" title="God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.">Genesis 9:27</a>. Though its general meaning is <span class= "ital">beautiful, </span>yet there can be no doubt that the light colour of Sarai's complexion was that which would chiefly commend her to the Egyptians; for she was now past sixty, and though vigorous enough to bear a son at ninety, yet that was by the special favour of God. As she lived to the age of 127 (<a href="/genesis/23-1.htm" title="And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.">Genesis 23:1</a>), she was now about middle age, and evidently had retained much of her early beauty; and this, added to the difference of tint, would make her still attractive to the swarthy descendants of Ham, especially as they were not a handsome race, but had flat foreheads, high cheek-bones, large mouths, and thick lips. Twenty years later we find Abram still haunted by fears of the effects of her personal appearance (<a href="/genesis/20-2.htm" title="And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.">Genesis 20:2</a>), even when living among a better-featured race. From <a href="/genesis/20-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.">Genesis 20:13</a> it appears that on leaving Haran Abram and Sarai had agreed upon adopting this expedient, which seems to us so strangely contrary to the faith which the patriarch was at that very time displaying. He abandons his birthplace at the Divine command, and starts upon endless wanderings; and yet, to protect his own life, he makes an arrangement which involves the possible sacrifice of the chastity of his wife; and twice, but for God's interference, this painful result would actually have happened. Perhaps Abram may have depended upon Sarai's cleverness to help herself out of the difficulty; but such a mixture of faith and weakness, of trust in God in abandoning so much and trust in worldly policy for preservation in a foreseen danger, cannot but make us feel how much of infirmity there was even in a character otherwise so noble.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span> (literally, <span class="accented">it was</span>), <span class="cmt_word">when he was come near to enter into Egypt</span> (that he had his misgivings, arising probably from his own eminence, which could scarcely fail to attract attention among strangers, but chiefly from the beauty of his wife, which was calculated to inflame the cupidity and, it might be, the violence of the warm-blooded Southrons, and) <span class="cmt_word">that he said unto Sarai his wife</span>. The arrangement here referred to appears (<a href="/genesis/20-13.htm">Genesis 20:13</a>) to have been preconcerted on first setting out from Ur or Haran, so that Abram's address to his wife on approaching Egypt may be viewed as simply a reminder of their previous compact. <span class="cmt_word">Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">fair of aspect</span> (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>). Though now upwards of sixty-five years of age, she was still in middle life (<a href="/genesis/23-1.htm">Genesis 23:1</a>), and her constitution had not been impaired by bearing children. Besides, the clear complexion of Sarah would render her specially attractive in the eyes of the Egyptians, whose women, though not so dark as the Nubians and Ethiopians, were yet of a browner tinge than the Syrians and Arabians. Monumental evidence confirms the assertion of Scripture that a fair complexion was deemed a high recommendation in the age of the Pharaohs (<span class="accented">ride</span> Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 200). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that</span>) the Egyptians - notorious for their licentiousness (<span class="accented">vide</span> P. Smith's ' History of the World,' vol. 1. <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>. p. 71) - <span class="cmt_word">shall see thee, that</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">they shall say, this is his wife: and they will kill me</span> - in order to possess thee, counting murder a less crime than adultery (Lyra). An unreasonable anxiety, considering that he had hitherto enjoyed the Divine protection, however natural it might seem in view of the voluptuous character of the people. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">they will save thee alive</span> - for either compulsory marriage or dishonorable use. <span class="cmt_word">Say, I pray thee</span>, - translated in ver. 11 as "now;" "verbum obsecrantis vel adhortantis" (Masius) - <span class="cmt_word">thou art my sister</span>. A half-truth (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>), but a whole falsehood. The usual apologies, that he did not fabricate, but "cautiously conceal the truth" (Lyra), that perhaps he acted in obedience to a Divine impulse (Mede), that he dissembled in order to protect his wife's chastity (Rosenm&uuml;ller), are not satisfactory. On the other hand, Abram must not be judged by the light of New Testament revelation. It is not necessary for a Christian in every situation Of life to tell all the truth, especially when its part suppression involves no deception, and is indispensable for self-preservation; and Abram may have deemed it legitimate as a means of securing both his own life and Sarah's honor, though how he was to shield his wife in the peculiar circumstances it is difficult to see. Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests that he knew the preliminary ceremonies to marriage required a considerable time, and counted upon being able to leave Egypt before any injury was done to Sarah. The only objection to this is that the historian represents him as being less solicitous about the preservation of his wife's chastity than about the conservation of his own life. <span class="cmt_word">That it may be well</span> (not with thee, though doubtless this is implied, but) <span class="cmt_word">with me for thy sake</span> (the import of which is declared in the words which follow); <span class="cmt_word">and my soul shall live because of thee</span>.
