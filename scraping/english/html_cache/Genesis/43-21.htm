The mention of lodging for the night suggests a long journey, consistent with the distance between Egypt and Canaan. This reflects the historical context of ancient travel, which was slow and required stopping at caravanserais or other safe places for rest.<p><b>we opened our sacks and, behold, each of us found his silver in the mouth of his sack!</b><br>The discovery of the silver in their sacks is significant. In the ancient Near East, silver was a common medium of exchange, and its unexpected return would have been alarming. This event is a pivotal moment in the narrative, highlighting themes of divine providence and testing. The brothers' fear upon finding the silver suggests a guilty conscience, possibly linked to their earlier treatment of Joseph. This incident foreshadows the testing of their integrity and repentance.<p><b>It was the full amount of our silver</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the completeness of the returned silver, underscoring the miraculous or mysterious nature of the event. This completeness can be seen as a test of honesty and integrity, as the brothers must decide whether to keep the silver or return it. The full amount also signifies the thoroughness of God's provision and the testing of their character.<p><b>and we have brought it back with us</b><br>This action demonstrates the brothers' decision to act righteously by returning the silver. It reflects a change in their character, contrasting with their earlier deceitful actions against Joseph. This decision to return the silver can be seen as an act of repentance and a step towards reconciliation. It also aligns with biblical principles of restitution and honesty, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/leviticus/6.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, which discusses making amends for wrongs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who traveled to Egypt to buy grain during the famine.
