The inclusion of "every kind" suggests a divine intention to preserve the biodiversity of creation. The number "two" signifies the minimum requirement for reproduction, ensuring the continuation of each species. This mirrors the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God creates various kinds of living creatures. The mention of birds, animals, and crawling creatures encompasses the full range of terrestrial life, highlighting the scope of the impending flood's impact and the necessity of divine intervention for preservation.<p><b>will come to you</b><br>This implies a supernatural element in the gathering of the animals. Noah is not tasked with the impossible job of rounding up every species; instead, God orchestrates their arrival. This reflects God's sovereignty and control over creation, as seen in other biblical instances where animals act under divine direction, such as the ravens feeding Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>). It also prefigures the peaceable kingdom described in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where natural enmity is suspended.<p><b>to be kept alive</b><br>The purpose of the animals coming to Noah is explicitly stated: preservation of life. This aligns with God's covenantal promise to sustain life on earth, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture. The act of keeping alive is a foreshadowing of salvation, where Noah's ark becomes a type of Christ, offering refuge and life amidst judgment. This anticipates the New Testament message of salvation through Jesus, who offers eternal life to those who come to Him (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>). The preservation of life here also underscores the value God places on His creation, a principle that informs Christian stewardship of the environment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.
