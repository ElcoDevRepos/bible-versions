Sodom, along with Gomorrah, was known for its grave sin, which is detailed in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>.

This act of looking toward Sodom foreshadows the divine judgment that is about to be revealed.<p><b>and Abraham walked along with them to see them off</b><br>Abraham's action of walking with the men demonstrates his hospitality and respect, a significant cultural value in the ancient Near East. It also shows his continued relationship and intercession with God, as he later pleads for Sodom. This act of accompanying them can be seen as a type of Christ, who walks with humanity and intercedes on their behalf.
