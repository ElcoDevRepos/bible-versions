The house he enters is that of Bethuel, Rebekah's father, in the region of Paddan Aram. This journey signifies the fulfillment of Abraham's desire to find a suitable wife for Isaac from his own kin, rather than from the Canaanites. The act of entering the house symbolizes hospitality and the beginning of negotiations, a common cultural practice in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>and the camels were unloaded</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in ancient times, used for long-distance travel and trade. The unloading of camels indicates the end of a journey and the beginning of rest and refreshment. This act also signifies the servant's intention to stay and engage in serious discussions. The presence of camels suggests wealth and status, as they were not common animals for everyone to own.<p><b>Straw and feed were brought to the camels</b><br>Providing for the camels demonstrates the hospitality and generosity of Bethuel's household. In ancient cultures, caring for a guest's animals was an essential part of welcoming them. This act of kindness reflects the values of the time, where hospitality was a sacred duty. It also shows the readiness of Rebekah's family to accommodate the needs of their visitors, which is a positive sign for the servant's mission.<p><b>and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions</b><br>Foot washing was a customary practice in ancient times, especially in regions with dusty roads and hot climates. It was a gesture of hospitality and respect, often performed by a servant or host. This act not only provided physical relief but also symbolized the cleansing and renewal of the traveler. In the New Testament, Jesus washes the feet of His disciples, echoing this tradition and emphasizing servanthood and humility. The provision of water for foot washing here underscores the warm welcome and acceptance of the visitors by Rebekah's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man (Eliezer)</a></b><br>Abraham's servant, tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.
