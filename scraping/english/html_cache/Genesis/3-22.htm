The use of "LORD God" combines the covenant name Yahweh with Elohim, highlighting both His personal relationship with humanity and His supreme power. This moment follows the fall of man, where God addresses the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, the man has become like one of Us,</b><br>The plural "Us" suggests a divine council or the Trinity, indicating a complex unity within the Godhead. This reflects the earlier creation narrative where God said, "Let Us make man in Our image." The phrase underscores the tragic irony that humanity sought to be like God through disobedience, achieving a distorted likeness by knowing good and evil.<p><b>knowing good and evil.</b><br>This knowledge was not merely intellectual but experiential, marking a loss of innocence and the beginning of moral responsibility. It contrasts with the innocence of Adam and Eve before the fall and highlights the shift in their relationship with God and creation. This knowledge brought shame and separation from God, as seen in their hiding and covering themselves.<p><b>And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life,</b><br>The tree of life represents eternal life and ongoing fellowship with God. In the Garden of Eden, it was accessible to Adam and Eve, symbolizing the potential for eternal life in obedience. After the fall, access to this tree is restricted to prevent humanity from living eternally in a fallen state, indicating God's mercy in not allowing eternal separation from Him.<p><b>and eat, and live forever...&#8221;</b><br>This phrase implies that eating from the tree of life would grant eternal life, a state now undesirable due to sin. The prevention of access to the tree is an act of divine grace, ensuring that redemption and restoration would come through God's plan, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a> references the tree of life in the New Jerusalem, symbolizing restored access through Christ's redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The Creator and sovereign ruler of the universe, who is speaking in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man (Adam and Eve)</a></b><br>The first humans created by God, who have disobeyed Him by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tree_of_life.htm">The Tree of Life</a></b><br>A tree in the Garden of Eden that grants eternal life to those who eat its fruit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The perfect paradise where Adam and Eve lived before their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_council.htm">The Divine Council</a></b><br>The phrase "like one of Us" suggests a conversation within the Trinity or a heavenly council, indicating a plurality in the Godhead.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence_of_sin.htm">The Consequence of Sin</a></b><br>Sin leads to separation from God and the loss of eternal life.

To prevent eternalization of that broken state, the LORD barred the tree of life, setting the stage for redemption in Christ, who will one day grant renewed access to the tree in the New Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">As one of us.</span>--See Note on <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>. By the fall man had sunk morally, but grown mentally. He had asserted his independence, had exercised the right of choosing for himself, and had attained to a knowledge without which his endowment of free-will would have remained in abeyance. There is something painful and humiliating in the idea of Chrysostom and other Fathers that the Deity was speaking ironically, or even with insult (Augustine). All those qualities which constitute man's likeness to God--free-will, self-dependence, the exercise of reason and of choice--had been developed by the fall, and Adam was now a very different being from what he had been in the days of his simple innocency.<p><span class= "bld">Lest he put forth his hand.</span>--Adam had exercised the power of marring God's work, and if an unending physical life were added to the gift of freewill now in revolt against God, his condition and that of mankind would become most miserable. Man is still to attain to immortality, but it must now be through struggle, sorrow, penitence, faith, and death. Hence a paradise is no fit home for him. The Divine mercy, therefore, commands Adam to quit it, in order that he may live under conditions better suited for his moral and spiritual good.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God said</span>. <span class="accented">Verba insultantis</span> (Augustine); <span class="accented">ironica reprobatio</span> (Calvin).
