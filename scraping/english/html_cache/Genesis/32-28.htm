The context is Jacob's wrestling match at Peniel, a pivotal moment in his life. This encounter is significant as it marks a transformation in Jacob's identity and relationship with God.<p><b>Your name will no longer be Jacob</b><br>Jacob, meaning "supplanter" or "heel-grabber," reflects his earlier life characterized by deception and struggle, notably with his brother Esau. The change of name signifies a change in character and destiny, a common biblical motif where God renames individuals to reflect their new roles or missions (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah).<p><b>but Israel</b><br>The name Israel is often interpreted as "he struggles with God" or "God prevails." This new name signifies Jacob's transformation from a deceiver to one who has a direct and personal relationship with God. It also foreshadows the nation that will descend from him, the Israelites, who are God's chosen people. This name change is a prophetic act, indicating the future struggles and triumphs of the nation of Israel.<p><b>because you have struggled with God and with men</b><br>Jacob's life was marked by struggles, both divine and human. His wrestling with the man symbolizes his lifelong struggles, including those with Esau, Laban, and his own nature. The struggle with God represents his spiritual journey and the challenges of faith. This phrase highlights the dual nature of Jacob's conflicts, both earthly and spiritual.<p><b>and you have prevailed</b><br>Despite his struggles, Jacob emerges victorious, not by overpowering God, but by holding on and seeking a blessing. This victory is not about physical strength but about perseverance and faith. It reflects the biblical theme that true victory comes through reliance on God. This prevailing is a type of Christ, who also struggled and prevailed through obedience and submission to God's will, ultimately achieving victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau.

Jacob recognizes this when he later testifies, &#8220;I have seen God face to face&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). Encounters of this kind appear throughout Scripture&#8212;Abraham hosts three visitors, one of whom is &#8220;the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1-2</a>); Manoah fears death after seeing &#8220;God&#8221; in bodily form (<a href="/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a>). The same Lord who speaks in those scenes now speaks to Jacob, initiating a life-defining change.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your name will no longer be Jacob</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s birth name, linked with grasping Esau&#8217;s heel (<a href="/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>) and deceiving for the blessing (27:36), has come to signify a life marked by scheming. God declares an end to that identity. Just as Abram became Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) and Simon became Peter (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>), the renaming signals a decisive work of grace. The old patterns of manipulation must give way to trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Israel</b><p>The new name assigns Jacob a destiny larger than himself. From now on he embodies the nation that will bear this name (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). Every time Scripture speaks of &#8220;the children of Israel,&#8221; it recalls this night. The change also points ahead to personal transformation promised to all who belong to God; believers too will receive &#8220;a new name&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>) as evidence of belonging and mission.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because you have struggled with God</b><p>The wrestling match is no mere athletic contest but a vivid picture of prayerful persistence. <a href="/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3-4</a> explains that Jacob &#8220;wept and begged for His favor.&#8221; By clinging instead of quitting, Jacob moves from self-reliance to God-dependence. The Lord invites similar tenacity: &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And with men</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s life has been one long contest&#8212;with Esau&#8217;s rivalry (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>; 32:6), Laban&#8217;s exploitation (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>), even family tensions (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1-2</a>). God acknowledges those battles, showing He has been present through each confrontation. Believers too face both spiritual and human conflicts (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <a href="/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>) that God uses to refine character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And you have prevailed</b><p>Jacob &#8220;prevails&#8221; not by overpowering God&#8212;an impossibility&#8212;but by refusing to let go until blessed (<a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a>). His victory is faith-born perseverance, much like the widow who keeps coming to the judge (<a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>). In Christ we share the same promise: &#8220;In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>). Jacob&#8217;s limp (<a href="/genesis/32-31.htm">Genesis 32:31</a>) reminds us that prevailing often leaves us humbly dependent, yet undeniably blessed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a> marks the turning point where the schemer Jacob becomes Israel, the patriarch of a covenant people. God Himself initiates the change, honoring Jacob&#8217;s earnest struggle for blessing and affirming that persistent, faith-filled engagement with Him leads to victory&#8212;over spiritual trials, human conflicts, and, ultimately, over the self.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Israel.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">a prince of God, </span>or, <span class= "ital">one powerful with God. </span>(See Note on <a href="/genesis/17-15.htm" title="And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.">Genesis 17:15</a>.)
