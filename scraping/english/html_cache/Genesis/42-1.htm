Egypt, known for its fertile Nile Delta, often served as a breadbasket in times of regional famine. This situation recalls the earlier story of Abraham, who also went to Egypt during a famine (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>). The mention of Egypt foreshadows the Israelites' future enslavement and eventual exodus. The grain in Egypt symbolizes God's provision, even through foreign lands, and sets the stage for Joseph's role in God's plan.<p><b>he said to his sons</b><br>Jacob's sons are the progenitors of the twelve tribes of Israel. At this point, they are unaware of Joseph's position in Egypt. This moment highlights Jacob's leadership and responsibility for his family's survival. It also underscores the tension and dysfunction within the family, as the brothers are still dealing with the guilt of selling Joseph into slavery.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you staring at one another?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests a sense of urgency and frustration. The brothers' inaction may reflect their guilt and fear, as they are reminded of their past sins against Joseph. The phrase indicates a need for decisive action, pushing the narrative forward. It also serves as a reminder of human tendency to hesitate in times of crisis, contrasting with God's proactive provision through Joseph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite family, also known as Israel.
