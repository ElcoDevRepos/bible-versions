It was a requirement for all male descendants and those within Abraham's household, including servants. This practice set the Israelites apart from other nations and was a mark of their unique relationship with God. In the ancient Near East, circumcision was not universally practiced, making it a distinctive sign for the Israelites. Theologically, it symbolized the cutting away of sin and a commitment to holiness.<p><b>he will be cut off from his people;</b><br>The phrase "cut off" indicates a severe consequence, often implying death or excommunication. In the context of the covenant, it meant exclusion from the community and the blessings associated with being part of God's chosen people. This reflects the seriousness of covenantal obligations and the importance of obedience. The concept of being "cut off" is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a> and <a href="/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20-21</a>, where it denotes separation from the community due to disobedience.<p><b>he has broken My covenant.&#8221;</b><br>Breaking the covenant was a grave offense, as it represented a breach in the relationship with God. The covenant with Abraham was foundational for the identity and mission of Israel. It was not merely a legal agreement but a relational bond that required faithfulness. The breaking of the covenant through failure to perform circumcision was seen as a rejection of God's promises and commands.

Most Christian commentators suppose that the offender was to be put to death by the civil magistrate; but this view is untenable. For a distinction is constantly drawn between the penalty of death, and the being "cut off from among the people," as, for instance, in Leviticus 20. So, too, the killing of a clean beast anywhere, except at the door of the tabernacle (<a href="/leviticus/17-4.htm" title="And brings it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:">Leviticus 17:4</a>), and the eating of blood (<a href="/leviticus/17-9.htm" title="And brings it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it to the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:9</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-14.htm" title="For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said to the children of Israel, You shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whoever eats it shall be cut off.">Leviticus 17:14</a>), are to be thus dealt with, while blasphemy and murder are to be punished with death (<a href="/context/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16-17</a>). Now it became very common to kill clean beasts in all parts of the land, and the eating of blood, though regarded with horror (<a href="/context/1_samuel/14-32.htm" title="And the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.">1Samuel 14:32-34</a>), apparently had no penalty attached to it. The Jewish commentators seem to err only in being too special, and in defining the method in which God would punish. The punishment really seems to have been that of excommunication or outlawry, to which other penalties might have been attached by custom: but the main point was that one uncircumcised (as subsequently one who violated the principles of the Mosaic law) forfeited his privileges as a member of the Jewish nation, could claim no protection from the elders for life and property, and could not take his place at the gate of the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall be destroyed from amongst his nation, from among his people (<a href="/leviticus/17-4.htm">Leviticus 17:4, 10</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>), from Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), from the congregation of Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>), by the infliction of death at the hands of the congregation, the civil magistrate, or of God (Abarbanel, Gesenius, Clericus, Michaelis, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Wordsworth, Alford); or shall be excommunicated from the Church, and no longer reckoned among the people of God (Augustine, Vatablus, Piscator, Willet, Calvin, Knobel, Murphy, Kalisch, Inglis). That excision from one s people was in certain cases followed by the death penalty (<a href="/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/18-29.htm">Leviticus 18:29</a>; <a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30</a>) does not prove that the capital infliction was an invariable accompaniment of such sentence (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20, 21</a>; <a href="/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>).
