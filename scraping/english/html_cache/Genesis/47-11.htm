This act of settling his family in Egypt is significant as it marks the beginning of the Israelites' sojourn in a foreign land, which would eventually lead to their enslavement and the Exodus. Joseph's actions reflect the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). This also prefigures Christ, who provides for His people and prepares a place for them (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<p><b>and gave them property in the best part of the land</b><br>Joseph's provision of the best land demonstrates his favor and the special status of his family in Egypt. This best part of the land is often associated with the fertile region of Goshen, which was ideal for their pastoral lifestyle. This act of generosity can be seen as a type of Christ's provision for His followers, offering them abundant life (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p><b>the district of Rameses</b><br>The mention of Rameses is an anachronism, as the city of Rameses was named after the later Pharaohs of the 19th Dynasty. This suggests that the text was updated to reflect the known geography of the time of writing. The district of Rameses is traditionally identified with the region of Goshen, a fertile area in the Nile Delta. This location provided the Israelites with the resources needed to thrive and multiply, setting the stage for their eventual oppression and deliverance.<p><b>as Pharaoh had commanded</b><br>Pharaoh's command underscores the authority and influence Joseph wielded in Egypt. It also highlights the divine orchestration behind the events, as God used Joseph's position to preserve His chosen people. This command can be seen as a parallel to God's sovereign will, ensuring the survival and growth of the Israelites in preparation for their future exodus and fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who rose to power in Egypt.
