This decline in lifespan is often seen as a result of the increasing effects of sin in the world. Terah's age is significant as it places him in the post-Flood era, where lifespans were still notably longer than today but shorter than those of the pre-Flood patriarchs. The number 205 is not symbolic in itself but indicates the longevity of life during this period. Terah's lifespan also provides a chronological framework for the events leading to the call of Abraham, a pivotal moment in biblical history.<p><b>and he died in Haran</b><br>Haran is a significant location in the narrative of Genesis. It is situated in the region of Mesopotamia, which is modern-day Turkey. Haran was a major city on the trade route between Ur and Canaan, making it a logical stopping point for Terah and his family. The death of Terah in Haran marks a transition in the biblical narrative from Terah to his son Abram (later Abraham), who is called by God to continue the journey to Canaan. This event underscores the theme of leaving behind the old life and moving towards the promises of God. Haran is also a place of idolatry, as indicated by <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>, where Terah is mentioned as serving other gods. This highlights the call of Abraham to leave behind his past and follow the one true God. The death of Terah in Haran sets the stage for Abraham's obedience to God's call, which is a type of Christ's obedience to the Father, leaving His heavenly home to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/terah.htm">Terah</a></b><br>The father of Abram (later Abraham), Nahor, and Haran.
