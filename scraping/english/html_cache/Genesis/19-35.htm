The context is the aftermath of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, where Lot and his daughters have taken refuge in a cave. The repetition underscores the desperation and misguided actions of Lot's daughters, who believed they needed to preserve their family line.<p><b>they got their father drunk with wine</b><br>Wine in biblical times was a common beverage, often used in celebrations and religious rituals. However, its misuse is frequently warned against in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). The daughters' use of wine to intoxicate Lot reflects a moral decline and a lack of faith in God's provision, contrasting with the biblical ideal of sobriety and righteousness.<p><b>and the younger daughter went in and slept with him</b><br>This act is a continuation of the incestuous relationship initiated by the older daughter. It reflects the cultural and moral decay that can occur when individuals are removed from a community of faith and accountability. The act is reminiscent of the moral failures seen in other parts of Genesis, such as the sin of Ham (<a href="/genesis/9-20.htm">Genesis 9:20-25</a>).<p><b>he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up</b><br>Lot's lack of awareness underscores his vulnerability and the complete control his daughters had over the situation. This phrase highlights the consequences of excessive drinking, which leads to a loss of self-control and awareness. It also serves as a narrative device to emphasize Lot's passive role in the events, contrasting with his earlier active role in choosing to live near Sodom (<a href="/genesis/13-12.htm">Genesis 13:12-13</a>).<br><br>This passage, while troubling, serves as a reminder of the complexities of human sin and the need for divine grace. It also foreshadows the future enmity between the descendants of Lot's daughters, the Moabites and Ammonites, and the Israelites, illustrating the long-term consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, who settled in Sodom.

The daughters repeat the tactic of v. 33, demonstrating how sin often recycles the same lure (<a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29-35</a>).<p>&#8211; Lot&#8217;s intoxication removes his discernment, echoing Noah&#8217;s drunken vulnerability in <a href="/genesis/9-20.htm">Genesis 9:20-23</a>.<p>&#8211;

The &#8220;going in&#8221; signals premeditation, not passion, mirroring Tamar&#8217;s calculated deception in <a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14-18</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and slept with him</b><p>&#8211;

accountability before God is not removed by ignorance (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8211; The detail highlights that the daughters, not circumstances, orchestrated the sin, reminding believers that temptation originates in human desire (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-35.htm">Genesis 19:35</a> portrays the second calculated night in which Lot&#8217;s daughters exploit their father&#8217;s drunkenness to continue their incestuous plan. The verse exposes the destructive cycle of sin: persistent plotting, impaired judgment through intoxication, deliberate action, moral transgression, and ignorance that does not erase responsibility. This snapshot warns believers to flee the deceitfulness of sin, guard against impaired discernment, and trust God&#8217;s provision rather than scheming solutions born of fear or desperation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they made their father drink wine that night also</span>.
