This underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and Sarah, demonstrating God's power and faithfulness. The age of 100 also signifies a complete cycle, often associated with divine intervention and fulfillment in biblical numerology. Abraham's advanced age serves as a testament to his faith and patience, as he waited 25 years from the initial promise of a son (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4, 17</a>:1).<p><b>when his son Isaac</b><br>Isaac, whose name means "he laughs," is the child of promise, through whom God's covenant with Abraham would continue. Isaac's birth is a pivotal moment in the biblical narrative, as it establishes the lineage through which the nation of Israel would come. Isaac is a type of Christ, as both were promised sons, both had miraculous births, and both were involved in significant acts of sacrifice (Genesis 22, <a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17-19</a>).<p><b>was born to him.</b><br>The birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah is a fulfillment of God's specific promise to them (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19, 21</a>:1-2). This event is a key moment in the Abrahamic covenant, which includes the promise of numerous descendants and the land of Canaan. The birth signifies God's faithfulness to His word and His ability to bring life and hope where there was barrenness and impossibility. Isaac's birth also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through the lineage of Abraham, leading ultimately to the birth of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, originally named Abram.
