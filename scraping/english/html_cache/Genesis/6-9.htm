It marks a transition in the narrative, focusing on Noah and his lineage. The structure of Genesis is divided into these sections, each beginning with a similar phrase, indicating a new chapter in the unfolding story of humanity. Noah's account is significant as it leads to the story of the Flood, a pivotal event in biblical history.<p><b>Noah was a righteous man,</b><br>The term "righteous" in this context implies that Noah lived in accordance with God's standards. In a time of widespread corruption and violence, Noah's righteousness set him apart. This righteousness is not just moral uprightness but also a relational fidelity to God. Noah's life exemplifies the principle found in <a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, "the righteous will live by his faith," which is echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>).<p><b>blameless in his generation;</b><br>"Blameless" suggests integrity and completeness in character. In a corrupt generation, Noah's blamelessness highlights his distinctiveness. This does not imply sinlessness but rather a wholehearted devotion to God. The Hebrew word for "generation" can also mean "age" or "time," emphasizing the contrast between Noah and the prevailing culture. This anticipates the call for believers to be "blameless and pure" in a "crooked and depraved generation" (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><b>Noah walked with God.</b><br>Walking with God indicates a close, personal relationship with the Creator, characterized by faith and obedience. This phrase is also used to describe Enoch in <a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>, suggesting a continuity of faithful individuals amidst a fallen world. Walking with God implies ongoing fellowship and alignment with His will, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for walking humbly with God. Noah's walk with God prefigures the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly walked in obedience to the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A central figure in the Genesis account, Noah is described as a righteous and blameless man who walked with God.

Scripture often uses this phrase to launch a new, historical section (see <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; 10:1). Here it signals a shift from the broad description of human corruption (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>) to a focused narrative about one man and his family. By highlighting Noah&#8217;s story, the text invites us to see how God preserves a remnant in the midst of widespread evil, much like He later does with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and Joseph (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Noah was a righteous man</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;Noah was a righteous man&#8221;. Righteousness in Scripture always depends on God&#8217;s standard, not human opinion. Noah&#8217;s righteousness is affirmed directly by God in <a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>: &#8220;I have found you righteous in this generation&#8221;. The New Testament underscores that his righteousness was rooted in faith: &#8220;By faith Noah&#8230; became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>). <a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a> even lists Noah alongside Daniel and Job as exemplars of true righteousness, reminding us that authentic righteousness is recognized across both Testaments.<p>Key traits of Noah&#8217;s righteousness:<p>&#8226; Trusting God&#8217;s word before seeing results (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Acting in obedience despite cultural opposition (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Standing as a visible contrast to the pervasive wickedness around him (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blameless in his generation</b><p>The text adds, &#8220;blameless in his generation&#8221;. &#8220;Blameless&#8221; describes integrity, not sinless perfection (see <a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).

This phrase first appeared of Enoch (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>) and points to ongoing communion. Walking indicates movement, progress, and daily fellowship rather than momentary encounters. <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> echoes this call: &#8220;Walk humbly with your God&#8221;.<p>Walking with God involves:<p>&#8226; Fellowship&#8212;regular, personal relationship with the Lord (<a href="/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience&#8212;responding to divine direction even when it seems unprecedented (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Perseverance&#8212;maintaining course for 120 years of ark-building amidst ridicule (<a href="/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a> paints a three-dimensional portrait of Noah: historically situated (&#8220;This is the account&#8221;), morally upright (&#8220;righteous&#8230; blameless&#8221;), and relationally devoted (&#8220;walked with God&#8221;). In a corrupt world doomed for judgment, Noah&#8217;s faith-fueled righteousness and intimate walk with God set the stage for humanity&#8217;s preservation through the flood.
