The LORD's presence signifies not only protection but also guidance and blessing. This echoes the covenantal promise God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring His faithfulness to their descendants. The presence of God with Joseph is a precursor to the New Testament promise of God being with believers through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>and he became a successful man</b><br>Joseph's success is attributed directly to the LORD's presence, highlighting the biblical principle that true prosperity comes from God. Despite being in a foreign land and initially a slave, Joseph's rise to success demonstrates God's ability to bless His people in any circumstance. This success is not merely material but also includes wisdom and favor, reminiscent of Solomon's request for wisdom and subsequent prosperity (<a href="/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10-14</a>).<p><b>serving in the household of his Egyptian master</b><br>Joseph's role as a servant in Potiphar's house places him in a position of humility and obedience, yet it is here that his leadership and administrative skills are honed. This setting in Egypt, a powerful and advanced civilization, provides a backdrop for Joseph's eventual rise to power. The cultural context of servitude in Egypt contrasts with Joseph's later authority, illustrating a theme of reversal and redemption. Joseph's service foreshadows Christ's own servanthood, as He came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, sold into slavery by his brothers, now serving in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively involved in Joseph's life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph is taken as a slave, representing a place of trial and testing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_egyptian_master.htm">Joseph's Egyptian Master</a></b><br>Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, who purchases Joseph as a slave.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/success.htm">Success</a></b><br>The prosperity and favor Joseph experiences due to God's presence with him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_adversity.htm">God's Presence in Adversity</a></b><br>Even in difficult circumstances, God's presence can lead to success and favor.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>Joseph's diligence and integrity in serving Potiphar demonstrate how we should serve others, regardless of our situation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_favor.htm">Divine Favor</a></b><br>True success is not measured by worldly standards but by God's favor and purpose in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Joseph's account encourages us to trust in God's overarching plan, even when we face trials.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_through_conduct.htm">Witness Through Conduct</a></b><br>Joseph's life in Egypt serves as a testimony to God's power and faithfulness, influencing those around him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_39_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 39:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_39_2_God_s_presence_in_Joseph.htm">How does Genesis 39:2 demonstrate God's presence in Joseph's life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_success_from_Joseph_s_story.htm">What can we learn about success from "the LORD was with Joseph"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Joseph_s_story_and_Romans_8_28_link.htm">How does Joseph's story connect to Romans 8:28 about God's purpose?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_God_in_daily_work.htm">In what ways can we seek God's presence in our daily work?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Joseph_s_faith_to_challenges.htm">How can we apply Joseph's faithfulness to our own challenging situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_39_2_God_s_presence_in_trials.htm">How does Genesis 39:2 demonstrate God's presence in times of adversity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Divine_favor_s_link_to_Joseph_s_success.htm">What does "The LORD was with Joseph" imply about divine favor and success?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_39_2_s_link_to_faith_prosperity.htm">How does Genesis 39:2 relate to the concept of prosperity in faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_39.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/evidence_of_hebrews_thriving_in_egypt.htm">Throughout Genesis 39, is there any evidence outside the text that corroborates the presence of Hebrews prospering in Egypt under divine favor?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_couldn't_judah_defeat_iron_chariots.htm">In Judges 1:19, if God was with Judah, why couldn&#8217;t they overcome iron chariots, suggesting a limitation of divine power?
