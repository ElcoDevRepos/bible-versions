In the context of Genesis, knowing one's family background was crucial for establishing social and covenantal relationships. This inquiry by Abraham's servant is significant as it seeks to confirm Rebekah's identity and suitability as a bride for Isaac, ensuring she is from Abraham's kin. This emphasis on lineage is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>, which trace Jesus' ancestry to fulfill messianic prophecies.<p><b>he asked.</b><br>The servant's inquiry demonstrates his obedience to Abraham's instructions to find a wife for Isaac from his own family. This reflects the servant's role as a faithful steward, a theme that resonates with the biblical principle of stewardship seen throughout Scripture, such as in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>). The servant's actions also highlight the importance of seeking God's guidance in fulfilling one's duties, as he had prayed for success in his mission earlier in the chapter.<p><b>Please tell me,</b><br>This polite request underscores the cultural norms of hospitality and respect in ancient societies. The servant's approach is courteous, reflecting the biblical value of treating others with kindness and respect, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>, which encourages believers to consider others above themselves. This manner of speaking also sets the stage for Rebekah's response, which will reveal her character and willingness to extend hospitality.<p><b>is there room in your father&#8217;s house</b><br>The mention of the father's house indicates the patriarchal structure of family life during this period. The father's house was not only a physical dwelling but also a symbol of familial authority and provision. This concept is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of His Father's house in <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>, promising a place for His followers. The servant's question also anticipates the hospitality that Rebekah's family will offer, a key theme in the narrative.<p><b>for us to spend the night?</b><br>The request for lodging highlights the cultural expectation of hospitality in the ancient Near East, where travelers relied on the generosity of others for shelter. This practice is evident in other biblical accounts, such as the hospitality shown to the angels by Lot in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The servant's request also foreshadows the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Rebekah's response will lead to her becoming Isaac's wife, continuing the Abrahamic covenant. This theme of divine guidance and provision is a recurring motif throughout Scripture, illustrating God's faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, likely Eliezer, is on a mission to find a wife for Isaac, Abraham's son.

Abraham had charged him to find a wife &#8220;from my own relatives&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-4.htm">Genesis 24:4</a>). By asking this, he tests whether God&#8217;s providence has led him to the right family, echoing God&#8217;s faithfulness in <a href="/genesis/22-23.htm">Genesis 22:23</a> where Rebekah&#8217;s birth is recorded.<p>&#8226; The question also protects the covenant line&#8212;just as later Boaz inquires, &#8220;Whose young woman is this?&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-5.htm">Ruth 2:5</a>), guarding purity and promise.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant purposes consistently move through specific families (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), showing that genealogy matters to the unfolding plan of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please tell me,</b><p>&#8220;Please tell me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-23.htm">Genesis 24:23</a>)<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s courtesy models gracious speech&#8212;&#8220;Let your speech always be gracious&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>). He does not demand information; he courteously requests it, reflecting the humility that accompanies faith (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His politeness underscores how divine guidance works through ordinary manners. Even while on a mission directed by God (<a href="/genesis/24-40.htm">Genesis 24:40</a>), he remains respectful, recognizing that godliness and courtesy belong together (<a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is there room in your father&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8220;Is there room in your father&#8217;s house&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-23.htm">Genesis 24:23</a>)<p>&#8226; Hospitality was a sacred duty; Abraham had earlier welcomed strangers under the oaks of Mamre (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3-5</a>), and Lot did the same in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>). The servant follows that pattern, trusting God to open hearts as well as doors.<p>&#8226; The phrase hints at a larger theological picture: &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many rooms&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2</a>). As Rebekah&#8217;s household opens space for the servant, we see a reflection of the Father who prepares dwelling places for His people.<p>&#8226; Hospitality often marks pivotal moments in Scripture; the open home becomes a stage for covenant progression (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for us to spend the night?</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;for us to spend the night?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/24-23.htm">Genesis 24:23</a>)<p>&#8226; Seeking lodging acknowledges human limitation and God&#8217;s daily provision. Jacob will later &#8220;spend the night&#8221; on his journey and meet God at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11-15</a>); Paul and Silas accept Lydia&#8217;s invitation to stay (<a href="/acts/16-15.htm">Acts 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Resting under another&#8217;s roof displays trust: &#8220;Whatever town&#8230;stay there until you leave that place&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11</a>). Reliance on offered shelter mirrors spiritual rest&#8212;&#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The servant&#8217;s request sets the stage for deeper relationship; sharing a night&#8217;s rest becomes the doorway to a lifelong union between Isaac and Rebekah, demonstrating how God weaves ordinary needs into extraordinary outcomes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-23.htm">Genesis 24:23</a> records a simple, courteous inquiry that carries covenant weight. By asking Rebekah about her family and a place to lodge, Abraham&#8217;s servant verifies lineage, models gracious speech, relies on God-ordained hospitality, and trusts the Lord for immediate provision. In these brief words, Scripture shows how everyday conversations advance God&#8217;s faithful purposes and open the path for His promised blessings to unfold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Whose</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">daughter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are you?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1428;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he asked.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
