The city of Sodom is historically known for its wickedness, as referenced in <a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>. Lot, Abraham's nephew, chose to live in Sodom despite its reputation, which sets the stage for the events in this chapter. The calling out suggests a public confrontation, highlighting the lack of shame or restraint among the city's inhabitants.<p><b>&#8220;Where are the men who came to you tonight?</b><br>The men of Sodom are referring to the two angels who appeared as men and visited Lot. This question reveals their awareness of the visitors' presence, indicating a close-knit community where strangers are quickly noticed. The timing, "tonight," suggests that the events are unfolding under the cover of darkness, often associated with evil deeds in biblical literature (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><b>Send them out to us</b><br>This demand reflects the aggressive and inhospitable nature of the Sodomites. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality was a sacred duty, and Lot's role as host would have included protecting his guests. The demand to send out the visitors violates this cultural norm and underscores the moral depravity of the city.<p><b>so we can have relations with them!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a euphemism for sexual relations, indicating the intent of the men of Sodom to commit acts of sexual violence. The Bible consistently condemns such behavior, and this incident is often cited as evidence of Sodom's sinfulness, which led to its eventual destruction (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). The New Testament references Sodom as an example of divine judgment against immorality (<a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>).
