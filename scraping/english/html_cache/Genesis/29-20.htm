This practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as when Abraham's servant brought gifts for Rebekah's family (Genesis 24). Jacob's willingness to serve for seven years demonstrates his deep love and commitment, contrasting with the deceitful nature of his uncle Laban, who later tricks him into marrying Leah first. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting the fullness of Jacob's dedication.<p><b>yet it seemed but a few days</b><br>This phrase highlights the intensity and sincerity of Jacob's love for Rachel. His perception of time is altered by his affection, a theme echoed in the Song of Solomon, where love is described as powerful and consuming (<a href="/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6-7</a>). This idea of love transforming one's experience of time can also be seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to endure hardships with joy because of their love for Christ and the hope of eternal life (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><b>because of his love for her</b><br>Jacob's love for Rachel is a central theme in this narrative, illustrating the biblical ideal of love as selfless and enduring. This love can be seen as a type of Christ's love for the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is the model for marital relationships. Jacob's love also contrasts with the more transactional relationships often seen in the ancient world, emphasizing the personal and relational nature of biblical love. This enduring love foreshadows the covenantal love God has for His people, which is steadfast and unchanging.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau.

The purity and intensity of Jacob's affection was declared not alone by the proposal of a seven years' term of servitude, - a long period of waiting for a man of fifty-seven, if not seventy-seven, years of age, - but also by the spirit in which he served his avaricious relative.
