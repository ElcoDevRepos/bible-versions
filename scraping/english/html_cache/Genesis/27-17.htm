Rebekah's favoritism towards Jacob is evident here, contrasting with Isaac's preference for Esau. This family dynamic sets the stage for the conflict and fulfillment of God's prophecy in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where it was foretold that the older would serve the younger. The act of handing over the food signifies Rebekah's direct involvement and manipulation in ensuring Jacob receives the blessing meant for Esau.<p><b>the tasty food and bread</b><br>The preparation of "tasty food" indicates Rebekah's knowledge of Isaac's preferences, as he had a fondness for game prepared by Esau. This detail underscores the deception's intricacy, as Rebekah replicates Esau's cooking to deceive Isaac. The inclusion of bread suggests a complete meal, emphasizing the cultural importance of hospitality and the significance of meals in covenantal contexts, as seen in other biblical narratives like the Last Supper (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>).<p><b>she had made</b><br>Rebekah's personal involvement in making the meal highlights her commitment to the plan. This action reflects the cultural role of women in domestic tasks during the patriarchal period. It also shows her determination to fulfill what she believes is God's will for Jacob, despite the moral implications. This act of making the meal herself can be seen as a type of intercession, drawing a parallel to Christ's role as an intercessor for humanity, as He provides what is necessary for the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.
