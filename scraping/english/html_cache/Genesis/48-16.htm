This angel is often understood to be a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>, where Jacob wrestles with a man who is later revealed to be God. The term "redeemed" suggests deliverance and salvation, themes central to the biblical narrative. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God as a redeemer, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, where God delivers His people from bondage and harm.<p><b>may He bless these boys.</b><br>Jacob is invoking a blessing upon Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. The act of blessing is significant in biblical tradition, often involving the transmission of covenantal promises and divine favor. This blessing is reminiscent of the patriarchal blessings given by God to Abraham and Isaac, emphasizing the continuation of God's promises through the generations. The blessing of children is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a> with Isaac blessing Jacob, and it underscores the importance of familial lineage in God's plan.<p><b>And may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,</b><br>Jacob desires that Ephraim and Manasseh be identified with the covenantal promises given to Abraham and Isaac. This reflects the importance of identity and heritage in the biblical narrative. By being called by these names, the boys are being grafted into the lineage of the patriarchs, ensuring their inclusion in the blessings and promises of God. This act also signifies the adoption of Joseph's sons into the Israelite tribes, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, where Jacob claims them as his own.<p><b>and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase echoes the Abrahamic covenant, where God promises to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>) and the sand on the seashore (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The idea of growing into a multitude signifies not only numerical growth but also the expansion of influence and blessing. This promise is fulfilled in the history of Israel, as Ephraim and Manasseh become two of the twelve tribes, playing significant roles in the nation's development. The imagery of a multitude also points forward to the New Testament, where the spiritual descendants of Abraham, through faith in Christ, are described as a great multitude from every nation (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch who is blessing his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh, in this passage.

Earlier he wrestled with &#8220;a man&#8221; who is later identified as God (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>); he saw a ladder and heard the LORD above it (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). Scripture also speaks of &#8220;the Angel of the LORD&#8221; who appears as God Himself (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>). Jacob now views that same divine Messenger as his personal Redeemer, echoing <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, &#8220;The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and delivers them.&#8221; By using the verb &#8220;has redeemed,&#8221; Jacob credits every past rescue&#8212;from Esau (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm">Genesis 33:4</a>), from Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>), from famine (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>)&#8212;to this gracious, covenant-keeping Deliverer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may He bless these boys</b><p>Without hesitation, Jacob invokes the very Redeemer&#8217;s favor upon Ephraim and Manasseh, confident that &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Old Testament blessing is tangible and spiritual: protection, prosperity, and a heritage of faith (<a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>; 49:25). Jacob&#8217;s words mirror the priestly benediction later given to Israel: &#8220;The LORD bless you and keep you&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus likewise laid hands on children and blessed them (<a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>), showing the continuity of God&#8217;s heart for generational blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac</b><p>Jacob formally adopts the two boys (<a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>), granting them equal status with his own sons so that they inherit the covenant line. Being &#8220;called by my name&#8221; means carrying Jacob&#8217;s identity as Israel; bearing &#8220;the names of my fathers&#8221; ties them directly to Abraham and Isaac, heirs of the promise (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; 26:24). This act preserves the patriarchal heritage and visually illustrates <a href="/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7-8</a>&#8212;true lineage is traced through God&#8217;s promise rather than mere biology.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may they grow into a multitude upon the earth</b><p>The phrasing recalls God&#8217;s original mandate, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), and His repeated pledge to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-6</a>; 35:11). Jacob envisions Ephraim and Manasseh swelling into countless tribes, a forecast fulfilled when Joshua, a descendant of Ephraim, leads Israel into Canaan (<a href="/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>), and when &#8220;thousands of Manasseh&#8221; fight valiantly (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>).
