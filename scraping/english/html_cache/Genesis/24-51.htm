In the cultural context of the time, the presence of a woman before a suitor or his representative was significant, as it symbolized her readiness and willingness to enter into a marriage covenant. This moment is a fulfillment of the servant's prayer for guidance (<a href="/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12-14</a>), demonstrating God's providence in the selection of a wife for Isaac.<p><b>Take her and go,</b><br>The directive to "take her and go" reflects the customary practice of arranged marriages in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where family consent was crucial. The phrase underscores the authority and responsibility given to Abraham's servant to act on behalf of his master. It also signifies a transition, as Rebekah is to leave her family and homeland, echoing Abraham's own journey of faith when he left Ur (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). This act of leaving and cleaving is foundational in biblical marriage principles (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><b>and let her become the wife of your master&#8217;s son,</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the purpose of Rebekah's journey: to become Isaac's wife. It highlights the continuation of God's covenant promise to Abraham through Isaac, as marriage was essential for the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is a pivotal moment in the Genesis narrative, ensuring the lineage through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p><b>just as the LORD has decreed.&#8221;</b><br>The acknowledgment that the marriage is "just as the LORD has decreed" points to divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's will. This phrase affirms that the events are not merely coincidental but are orchestrated by God, aligning with the broader biblical theme of God's providential care and guidance. It reflects the belief that God is actively involved in the lives of His people, directing their paths (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). This decree also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Christ, who is the ultimate bridegroom of the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman from the family of Abraham's brother Nahor.
