This tax can be compared to the tithe system in Israel, where a portion of produce was given to support the Levites and the temple (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-32</a>). It highlights the importance of stewardship and provision in times of need.<p><b>and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the lasting impact of Joseph's policies. Historically, it suggests that Joseph's economic reforms were successful and became a permanent part of Egyptian governance. It also underscores the enduring influence of Joseph's wisdom and leadership.<p><b>Only the priests&#8217; land does not belong to Pharaoh</b><br>The exemption of the priests' land from Pharaoh's ownership reflects the high status and influence of religious leaders in ancient Egypt. This parallels the special status of the Levitical priests in Israel, who were also provided for by the community (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>).

What preserved the nation in crisis became the standard revenue system afterward.<p>- Compared with later Eastern monarchies, this was moderate; Samuel warned Israel that a human king might demand far more (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15, 17</a>).<p>- By tying the tax to produce rather than land ownership, Joseph ensured flexibility: abundance or scarcity directly affected the amount owed (cf. <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day</b><p>- &#8220;To this day&#8221; signals that Moses, writing centuries later (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>), could still observe the law&#8217;s impact.<p>- The phrase roots the account in verifiable history, underscoring the reliability of the narrative (<a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>).<p>- Long-lasting policies reveal God&#8217;s providence not only for Israel but also for surrounding nations (<a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only the priests&#8217; land does not belong to Pharaoh</b><p>- Earlier verses explain that Pharaoh gave food allowances to Egypt&#8217;s priests, so their land remained untaxed (<a href="/genesis/47-22.htm">Genesis 47:22</a>).<p>- Even pagan systems recognized that religious service required material support; later, God would set a similar precedent for the Levites in Israel (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- The exemption distinguished priestly lands from those purchased by the crown, preventing total royal monopoly and leaving room for spiritual influence&#8212;a reminder that earthly power is never absolute (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-26.htm">Genesis 47:26</a> records Joseph&#8217;s wise, God-directed policy that instituted a 20 percent produce tax for Pharaoh, a measure still functioning when Moses wrote. It provided stable governance, preserved life, and balanced royal authority with a priestly exemption. The verse showcases God&#8217;s sovereignty in economic affairs, demonstrates the enduring impact of righteous leadership, and affirms the historical reliability of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the day of the narrator), that <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.</span> The account here given of the land tenure in Egypt, viz., <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that after the time of Joseph the kings of Egypt became lords paramount of the soil, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the only free landholders in the country were the members of the priestly caste, and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the population generally occupied their farms at the uniform fixed rent of one fifth of their yearly produce, is abundantly corroborated by the statements of Herodotus (2. 109), that Sesostris divided the soil of Egypt among the inhabitants, "assigning square plots of equal size to all, and obtaining his chief revenue from the rent which the holders were required to pay him year by year; of Diodorus Siculus (1. 73), that the land in Egypt belonged either to the priests, to the king, or to the military order; and of Strabo (17. 787), that the peasants were not landowners, but occupiers of ratable land; as also by the monuments, which represent the king, priests, and warriors alone as having landed property (Wilkinson, Ken). Dr. Robinson quotes a modern parallel to this act of Joseph's, which both illustrates its nature and by way of contrast exhibits its clemency. Up to the middle of the present century the people of Egypt had been the owners as well as tillers of the soil. "By a single decree the Pasha (Mohammed Ali) declared himself to be the sole owner of all lands in Egypt; and the people of course became at once-only his tenants at will, or rather his slaves." "The modern Pharaoh made no exceptions, and stripped the mosques and other religious and charitable institutions of their landed endowments as mercilessly as the rest. Joseph gave the people seed to sow, and required for the king only a fifth of the produce, leaving four-fifths to them as their own; but now, though seed is in like manner given out, yet every village is compelled to cultivate two-thirds of its lands with corn and other articles for the Pasha, and also to render back to him, in the form of taxes and exactions in kind, a large proportion of the produce remaining after" ('Biblical Researches,' 1:42). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/47-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1441;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">established</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
