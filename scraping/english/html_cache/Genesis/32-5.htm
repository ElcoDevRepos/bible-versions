In the ancient Near Eastern context, wealth was often measured by livestock and servants, indicating Jacob's significant status. Oxen and donkeys were valuable for agriculture and transportation, while flocks (sheep and goats) were essential for food, clothing, and trade. The mention of menservants and maidservants highlights the patriarchal society where servants were part of household wealth. This wealth was a fulfillment of God's promise to bless Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). The possession of such wealth also signifies God's favor and provision, which is a recurring theme in the lives of the patriarchs.<p><b>I have sent this message to inform my master,</b><br>Jacob's use of the term "my master" when referring to Esau is significant. It reflects a posture of humility and submission, which is crucial given their past conflict over the birthright and blessing (Genesis 27). By sending this message, Jacob seeks to reconcile with Esau, acknowledging his brother's potential authority and power. This act of sending messengers ahead is a strategic move to gauge Esau's disposition and to prepare for their meeting. It also demonstrates Jacob's cautious and diplomatic approach, which is consistent with his character throughout his narrative.<p><b>so that I may find favor in your sight.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The desire to find favor in Esau's sight indicates Jacob's hope for reconciliation and peace. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of seeking favor, which often involves humility, repentance, and the desire for restored relationships. In the broader biblical context, finding favor is associated with God's grace and mercy, as seen in figures like Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). Jacob's approach to Esau can be seen as a type of Christ's ministry of reconciliation, where humility and seeking peace are central. This phrase underscores the importance of mending broken relationships and the transformative power of forgiveness and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

By stating this plainly, Jacob:<p>&#8226; Confesses the tangible blessing God has given, echoing <a href="/genesis/12-16.htm">Genesis 12:16</a> where Abram&#8217;s livestock showed divine favor.<p>&#8226; Signals to Esau that he is not returning to claim more of the family estate; the Lord has already enriched him.<p>&#8226; Demonstrates readiness to share these blessings, anticipating the later gift of herds recorded in <a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13&#8211;15</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>donkeys</b><p>Donkeys were indispensable for transport and agriculture.
