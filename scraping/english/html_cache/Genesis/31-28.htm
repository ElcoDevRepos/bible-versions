Kissing was a common gesture of affection and blessing, as seen in other biblical passages (e.g., <a href="/genesis/27-26.htm">Genesis 27:26-27</a>). The mention of "grandchildren and daughters" highlights the patriarchal family structure, where the head of the family had significant authority and emotional bonds were deeply valued. Laban's complaint underscores the emotional impact of Jacob's sudden departure, which disrupted traditional customs of leave-taking and familial blessing.<p><b>Now you have done a foolish thing.</b><br>Laban's accusation of foolishness can be understood in the context of wisdom literature, where actions are often judged by their adherence to social norms and divine principles. In Proverbs, wisdom is associated with understanding and following God's ways, while foolishness is linked to rashness and disregard for proper conduct (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Laban's statement may also reflect his perception of Jacob's actions as not only socially inappropriate but potentially dangerous, given the importance of maintaining family alliances and the potential for conflict. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ongoing tension between Jacob and Laban, as well as a reminder of the need for wisdom and discernment in navigating complex family dynamics.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to Leah and Rachel.

In the patriarchal culture of Genesis, family bonds were treasured manifestations of God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/genesis/33-5.htm">Genesis 33:5</a>). Farewell kisses were a normal, affectionate custom&#8212;seen later when Joseph &#8220;kissed all his brothers and wept over them&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-15.htm">Genesis 45:15</a>). By leaving in secrecy, Jacob denied Laban that final, culturally significant gesture. The emotional tone echoes moments such as when Jonathan and David wept and kissed each other in parting (<a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>). Scripture affirms that grandparents possess a legitimate, affectionate interest in their descendants (<a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>), so Laban&#8217;s grief is understandable, even though his own behavior toward Jacob had often been manipulative (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and my daughters goodbye.</b><p>Laban&#8217;s second lament highlights his daughters, Leah and Rachel. Though they are now firmly under Jacob&#8217;s headship (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), Laban still longs for a proper send-off, reflecting the ancient Near Eastern expectation that a father would bless his daughters when they departed (compare <a href="/genesis/24-59.htm">Genesis 24:59&#8211;60</a>, where Rebekah&#8217;s family sends her away with a blessing). In <a href="/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a>, Naomi similarly urges her daughters-in-law to receive rest &#8220;each in the house of her own husband,&#8221; then she &#8220;kissed them,&#8221; underscoring the tenderness tied to farewells. By slipping away, Jacob denied Laban the paternal closure culturally associated with releasing daughters to a new life. Even so, Scripture records Rachel and Leah&#8217;s own testimony that their father had &#8220;treated us like foreigners&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-15.htm">Genesis 31:15</a>), reminding us that God values truth over mere social convention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now you have done a foolish thing.</b><p>Laban moves from grief to accusation. Calling Jacob&#8217;s action &#8220;foolish&#8221; frames it as reckless, much like Samuel&#8217;s rebuke of Saul: &#8220;You have acted foolishly&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>). In biblical terms, folly is not mere ignorance; it is a moral misstep that disregards God&#8217;s ways (<a href="/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>). Yet <a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a> reveals that God warned Laban in a dream, saying, &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.&#8221; Jacob&#8217;s departure, therefore, was under divine protection, even if executed without full transparency. Scripture often shows that human accusations of folly can mask deeper issues&#8212;here, Laban&#8217;s wounded pride and lost profit (<a href="/genesis/31-42.htm">Genesis 31:42</a>). Ultimately, wisdom is vindicated by God&#8217;s guidance rather than human opinion (<a href="/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a> records Laban&#8217;s emotional outcry: first grieving lost affection toward grandchildren, then toward daughters, and finally condemning Jacob&#8217;s stealth as folly. While Laban&#8217;s yearning for family farewells aligns with biblical values of relational warmth, his charge of foolishness overlooks God&#8217;s sovereign directive that authorized Jacob&#8217;s departure. The verse therefore illustrates how genuine feelings and flawed motives can mingle, yet God&#8217;s purposes prevail, safeguarding His covenant servant and foreshadowing the continuing faithfulness that will mark Israel&#8217;s history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">My sons.</span>--That is, my grandsons.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But you did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
