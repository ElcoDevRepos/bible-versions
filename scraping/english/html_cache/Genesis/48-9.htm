Joseph, once sold into slavery by his brothers, has risen to a position of power in Egypt. Despite his high status, he maintains respect and honor towards his father, reflecting the biblical principle of honoring one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This interaction occurs in Egypt, where Joseph has been living for many years, separated from his family.<p><b>&#8220;They are the sons God has given me in this place.&#8221;</b><br>Joseph acknowledges God's providence in his life, attributing the birth of his sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to divine blessing. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness, even in foreign lands. The phrase "in this place" underscores Joseph's recognition of God's blessings despite his circumstances in Egypt, a land of exile. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative of God blessing His people in unexpected places, as seen with the Israelites in Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>).<p><b>So Jacob said,</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, is the patriarch of the Israelite nation. His response to Joseph's introduction of his sons is significant, as it sets the stage for the blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh. Jacob's role as a patriarch involves passing on the covenantal blessings he received from God, which were first given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Please bring them to me,</b><br>Jacob's request to bring the sons closer indicates his intention to formally bless them. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, blessings from a patriarch were highly significant, often involving prophetic declarations about the future. This act of blessing is not merely a familial gesture but a spiritual and covenantal one, carrying implications for the future of the tribes of Israel.<p><b>that I may bless them.&#8221;</b><br>The blessing Jacob intends to give is more than a simple wish for well-being; it is a prophetic act that will have lasting implications for the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh. This blessing is reminiscent of the blessings given by Isaac to Jacob and Esau (Genesis 27), and it foreshadows the blessings Moses will later pronounce over the tribes of Israel (Deuteronomy 33). The act of blessing also points to the greater blessing found in Jesus Christ, who fulfills the promises made to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, who rose to prominence in Egypt.
