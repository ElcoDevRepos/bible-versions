Enosh, whose name means "mortal" or "man," signifies the beginning of a new generation. The birth of Enosh is significant as it marks the continuation of the godly line through which the promise of redemption would come. This lineage is crucial in biblical history as it leads to Noah and eventually to Jesus Christ, fulfilling God's promise of a Savior.<p><b>Seth lived 807 years</b><br>The long lifespan of Seth, as recorded here, reflects the antediluvian (pre-flood) conditions where people lived much longer than they do today. This extended lifespan allowed for the rapid population growth necessary to fill the earth. It also provided a means for the oral transmission of knowledge and traditions over many generations. The longevity of these patriarchs is a common theme in Genesis, emphasizing the vitality and strength of early humanity.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase highlights the fact that Seth, like many of the patriarchs, had a large family. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests that the genealogical records in Genesis are selective, focusing on the line through which God's redemptive plan would unfold. This also indicates the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The presence of other children implies a growing population and the spread of humanity across the earth, setting the stage for the events leading up to the flood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seth.htm">Seth</a></b><br>The third son of Adam and Eve, born after the death of Abel.

Scripture&#8217;s genealogies often anchor a man&#8217;s significance to the next generation, underscoring God&#8217;s design for faith to flow through families (<a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). By highlighting Enosh, Moses shows us that God preserved a righteous line after Abel&#8217;s death and Cain&#8217;s rebellion, a line that ultimately leads to Christ (<a href="/luke/3-38.htm">Luke 3:38</a>). Notice the sequence: God gives a child, and then life continues with new purpose. Parenting isn&#8217;t a pause but a platform for ongoing stewardship&#8212;something echoed in <a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-7</a>, where fathers are charged to pass on God&#8217;s testimonies. We read this clause and feel invited to ask, &#8220;How will the next generation know Him unless we tell them?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seth lived 807 years</b><p>The text continues, &#8220;Seth lived 807 years.&#8221; Pre-Flood longevity was God&#8217;s gracious norm (<a href="/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5, 9</a>; 5:32), offering ample time for humanity to &#8220;fill the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>) and for truth to be preserved through eyewitness testimony. These are real years; Scripture treats them as literal, just as it later takes Moses&#8217; 120 years or David&#8217;s 70 years literally. Long lifespans also magnify the seriousness of sin: even centuries of earthly life end in death, affirming that &#8220;the wages of sin is death&#8221; (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Second Peter 3:6-8 reminds us that God&#8217;s timetable is different from ours, and <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> gives a window into how He once ordered human life before the Flood reset creation&#8217;s environment (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><p>The verse closes, &#8220;and had other sons and daughters.&#8221; Seth&#8217;s fruitfulness echoes the original mandate, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), and anticipates its reaffirmation after the Flood (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). Scripture records selective genealogies; the named son carries the messianic line, but many siblings fill the earth (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>). Early marriages necessarily took place within Adam&#8217;s extended family&#8212;only later would the Mosaic Law prohibit close relations (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a>). By noting &#8220;other sons and daughters,&#8221; Moses quietly testifies that God&#8217;s blessing was not stingy: a thriving population flowed from the faith line as well as from Cain&#8217;s line, showing God&#8217;s common grace even while He unfolds His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/5-7.htm">Genesis 5:7</a> is more than a statistic; it&#8217;s a snapshot of God&#8217;s faithfulness. Seth fathers Enosh, physical proof that the promise of a Redeemer continues. His 807 additional years reveal God&#8217;s patience and generosity before the Flood. His many children illustrate God&#8217;s ongoing blessing of fruitfulness. Together, these simple facts remind us that every generation, every lifespan, and every child fit within the larger tapestry of redemption the Lord is weaving from Eden to eternity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had become the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124;
