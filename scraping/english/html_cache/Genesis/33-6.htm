The maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, were given to Jacob by his wives, Rachel and Leah, respectively, to bear children on their behalf. This practice reflects the customs of the time, where a woman's maidservant could serve as a surrogate to ensure the continuation of a family line. The children mentioned here are Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, who are part of the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating the importance of each family member in the unfolding narrative of God's chosen people.<p><b>approached and bowed down</b><br>The act of bowing down signifies respect and submission, a common cultural practice in the ancient Near East when meeting someone of higher status or authority. In this context, the bowing is directed towards Esau, Jacob's brother, as a gesture of reconciliation and humility. This act is part of Jacob's strategy to appease Esau, whom he had wronged years earlier by taking his birthright and blessing. The bowing also reflects the broader biblical theme of humility before God and others, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, which encourages believers to consider others more significant than themselves.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to Canaan after years in Haran.
