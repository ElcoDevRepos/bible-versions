This reflects the pastoral and agrarian lifestyle of the time, where wealth was often measured in livestock. The immediacy of "today" suggests a sense of urgency and a desire to establish fairness in his compensation.<p><b>and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep</b><br>Speckled or spotted sheep were less common and considered less desirable, which is why Jacob's proposal might have seemed favorable to Laban. This reflects the cultural context where solid-colored animals were often preferred. The act of removing these animals signifies a separation, which can be seen as a type of sanctification or setting apart, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>every dark-colored lamb</b><br>Dark-colored lambs were also less common and thus less valuable in the eyes of Laban. This choice by Jacob shows his reliance on God's provision rather than human standards of value. The mention of "dark-colored" can symbolize themes of contrast between light and darkness, a recurring motif in the Bible.<p><b>and every spotted or speckled goat</b><br>Goats, like sheep, were a significant part of pastoral wealth. The specific mention of "spotted or speckled" goats again highlights the less desirable nature of these animals. This choice underscores Jacob's faith in God's ability to bless him through what others might overlook or undervalue.<p><b>These will be my wages</b><br>Jacob's proposal is a form of ancient contract or agreement, reflecting the historical context of labor and compensation in the ancient Near East. This arrangement also foreshadows the divine intervention that would later ensure Jacob's prosperity, illustrating the biblical principle that God often blesses His people in unexpected ways. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also undervalued and rejected by men but chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to Leah and Rachel.

Jacob wants the arrangement settled immediately, leaving no room for later dispute&#8212;something Laban&#8217;s track record (<a href="/genesis/29-21.htm">Genesis 29:21-27</a>) makes prudent.<p>&#8226; The initiative shows Jacob&#8217;s willingness to work rather than demand unearned wealth (cf. <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By personally inspecting the flocks, Jacob will guarantee the integrity of the starting point, echoing the biblical value of honest weights and measures (<a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep</b><p>Jacob specifies that all multi-colored sheep be separated.<p>&#8226; Speckled or spotted sheep were relatively uncommon; Jacob chooses the minority so Laban can hardly claim he is taking the best (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38-40</a>).<p>&#8226; The choice puts Jacob&#8217;s future prosperity entirely in God&#8217;s hands, displaying faith that divine blessing, not human scheming, will increase him (<a href="/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; This distinction creates a clear, visual standard&#8212;no debate over ownership when lambs are born.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every dark-colored lamb</b><p>Most lambs are light; dark ones stand out.<p>&#8226; Again Jacob opts for rarities, making the agreement transparent (<a href="/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s favor toward those who humble themselves (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). By choosing the lesser share, Jacob mirrors that principle.<p>&#8226; The separation also protects against Laban&#8217;s later accusation: if a dark lamb is found among Laban&#8217;s flock, the evidence is obvious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And every spotted or speckled goat</b><p>Goats provided milk, meat, and hides. Multi-colored goats, like the speckled sheep, were a minority.<p>&#8226; Jacob keeps the same criterion across species, forming a unified, easy-to-track wage plan.<p>&#8226; The theme of visual markers runs through Scripture&#8212;e.g., the blood on Israel&#8217;s doorposts (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>)&#8212;illustrating how God often uses visible signs to affirm covenant boundaries.<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s forthcoming breeding strategy (<a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37-43</a>) will showcase God&#8217;s sovereignty over genetics, fulfilling the promise that Jacob would increase (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These will be my wages</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s compensation rests on the agreed markers.<p>&#8226; By tying wages to future births, Jacob enters a performance-based covenant, trusting God to prosper him fairly (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This prevents Laban from unilateral wage changes&#8212;something Laban later attempts anyway (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7-8</a>), proving Jacob&#8217;s foresight.<p>&#8226; The Bible commends honest laborers worthy of their wages (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>). Jacob&#8217;s proposal aligns with that ethic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a> records Jacob crafting a transparent, faith-filled wage agreement with Laban. By choosing the minority of speckled, spotted, and dark-colored animals, Jacob leaves room for God to demonstrate His covenant faithfulness. The clear visual standards protect against fraud, underscore integrity, and highlight that true increase comes from the Lord, not manipulation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">The speckled and spotted cattle (sheep)</span>.--In the East sheep are generally white, and goats black or brown. Jacob, therefore, proposes that all such shall belong to Laban, but that the parti-coloured should be his hire.

Besides these, Jacob is to have all "brown cattle," that is, <span class= "ital">sheep, </span>for the word "cattle" is usually now confined to kine, which was not the case 200 years ago.
