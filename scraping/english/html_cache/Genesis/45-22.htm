Joseph's act of giving new garments to his brothers signifies reconciliation and restoration of their relationship. This gesture echoes earlier biblical narratives, such as Jacob's gift of a special coat to Joseph, which initially sparked jealousy among the brothers. The provision of new garments can also be seen as a type of Christ's righteousness, where believers are clothed in new garments of salvation (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>).<p><b>but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver</b><br>Benjamin, Joseph's full brother, receives a greater gift, highlighting Joseph's special affection for him. The amount of silver is substantial, indicating wealth and favor. This act can be seen as a test of the brothers' jealousy, reminiscent of their earlier envy of Joseph. The silver also connects to the theme of redemption, as silver was often used in transactions and redemption in biblical times (<a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>).<p><b>and five sets of clothes</b><br>The five sets of clothes given to Benjamin further emphasize his favored status. In biblical numerology, the number five can symbolize grace. This act of giving multiple garments may foreshadow the abundance of grace and favor that God bestows upon His chosen people. It also serves as a test for the brothers, to see if they have overcome their past jealousy and are truly repentant. This generosity prefigures the lavish grace that Christ offers to believers, who are clothed in His righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt, and is now in a position to provide for his family during a famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>Joseph's younger brother, the only other son of Rachel, who receives special gifts from Joseph.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The other sons of Jacob who had previously sold Joseph into slavery and are now recipients of his generosity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has risen to power and where this event takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The father of Joseph and his brothers, who is back in Canaan awaiting news from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_forgiveness.htm">Generosity and Forgiveness</a></b><br>Joseph's actions demonstrate a heart of forgiveness and generosity, even towards those who wronged him.
