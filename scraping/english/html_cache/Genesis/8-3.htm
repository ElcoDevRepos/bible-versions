The Hebrew word used here suggests a continual and consistent decrease. This reflects God's control over the natural world, as He orchestrates the retreat of the waters. The receding waters symbolize a return to order from chaos, reminiscent of the creation narrative where God separates the waters to create dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). This event marks a new beginning for the earth, paralleling the new creation theme found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>.<p><b>and after 150 days</b><br>The specific mention of 150 days highlights the precision and orderliness of God's plan. This period includes the 40 days of rain and the subsequent time the waters prevailed before they began to recede. The number 150, being a multiple of 5 and 30, may symbolize completeness and divine order. This timeframe underscores the severity and totality of the flood, emphasizing the magnitude of God's judgment and the thoroughness of His cleansing of the earth.<p><b>the waters had gone down</b><br>The phrase indicates the completion of the recession process, preparing the earth for a new beginning. This mirrors the concept of redemption and restoration found throughout the Bible, where judgment is followed by renewal. The lowering of the waters sets the stage for Noah and his family to repopulate the earth, akin to a second creation. This anticipates the ultimate restoration through Christ, who brings new life and hope after judgment, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.

Gradually (Murphy, Ewald). The expression "denotes the turning-point after the waters had become calm" (T. Lewis). May it not be an attempt to represent the undulatory motion of the waves in an ebbing tide, in which the water seems first to advance, but only to retire with greater vehemence, reversing the movement of a flowing tide, in which it first retires and then advances - in the one case returning to go, in the other going to return?
