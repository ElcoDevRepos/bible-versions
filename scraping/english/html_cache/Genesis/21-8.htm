This milestone marked a significant transition from infancy to early childhood. The growth of Isaac is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and Sarah, emphasizing the faithfulness of God in His covenant. The weaning of Isaac signifies a new stage in his life, paralleling the spiritual growth expected of believers as they mature in faith. This event also foreshadows the growth and development of the nation of Israel, which would come from Isaac's lineage.<p><b>and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned</b><br>Feasts were common in biblical times to celebrate significant life events. Abraham's feast for Isaac's weaning underscores the joy and gratitude for God's provision and the fulfillment of His promise. This celebration can be seen as a type of the future Messianic banquet, where believers will celebrate with Christ. The feast also highlights the importance of community and family in the biblical narrative, as such events would have involved extended family and servants. This occasion contrasts with the tension that arises with Ishmael, Abraham's son by Hagar, pointing to the complex family dynamics and the unfolding of God's plan through Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The long-awaited son of Abraham and Sarah, whose birth was a fulfillment of God's promise.

The time of weaning is commonly believed to have been at the end of the second or third year (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/1-22.htm">1 Samuel 1:22-24</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/31-16.htm">2 Chronicles 31:16</a>; 2 Macc. 7:27; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 2:09, 6). <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">in the day of the weaning of Isaac</span>; probably, therefore, when Isaac was three years old and Ishmael seventeen.
