The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal and covenantal name of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and faithfulness. Abram's call is a divine initiative, highlighting God's grace and purpose. This moment is foundational for the Abrahamic covenant, which is central to the narrative of the Bible and the unfolding plan of redemption.<p><b>Leave your country</b><br>Abram is called to leave Haran, a significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, which was a center of commerce and culture. This command signifies a break from his past and the beginning of a journey of faith. The call to leave one's country is symbolic of a deeper spiritual journey, representing a departure from worldly attachments and a commitment to God's promises.<p><b>your kindred</b><br>Abram is asked to leave his extended family, which in ancient Near Eastern culture, was a source of identity, security, and support. This highlights the radical nature of Abram's obedience and trust in God. It also foreshadows the New Testament call to prioritize allegiance to Christ over familial ties (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p><b>and your father&#8217;s household</b><br>This phrase underscores the complete nature of Abram's call to faith. Leaving his father's household meant abandoning his inheritance and social status. It reflects a total reliance on God's provision and guidance. This act of faith is later commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>, where Abram's obedience is highlighted as an example of faith.<p><b>and go to the land I will show you</b><br>The destination is unknown to Abram, emphasizing the faith required to follow God's call. This land, later revealed as Canaan, becomes the Promised Land, central to the biblical narrative. It symbolizes God's promise and blessing, and is a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers. This journey prefigures the Christian walk of faith, trusting in God's promises without seeing the full picture (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who initiates a relationship with Abram, calling him to leave his familiar surroundings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is called by God to leave his homeland and family to follow God's direction to an unknown land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/country,_kindred,_and_father's_household.htm">Country, Kindred, and Father&#8217;s Household</a></b><br>Represents Abram's familiar environment, cultural identity, and familial ties, which he is asked to leave behind.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_i_will_show_you.htm">The Land I Will Show You</a></b><br>The Promised Land, which God will later reveal to Abram, symbolizing faith and obedience to God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>Abram's call teaches us the importance of trusting and obeying God, even when the future is uncertain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leaving_comfort_zones.htm">Leaving Comfort Zones</a></b><br>God often calls us to step out of our comfort zones to fulfill His purposes, requiring us to leave behind what is familiar.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_guidance.htm">God's Sovereignty and Guidance</a></b><br>Trusting in God's plan involves believing that He will guide us to where we need to be, even if the destination is unknown.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Abram's call marks the beginning of a covenant relationship with God, reminding us of the importance of being in a committed relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_journey.htm">Spiritual Journey</a></b><br>Like Abram, we are on a spiritual journey that requires faith, patience, and reliance on God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_12_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 12:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_12_1_God_s_call_to_faith_obedience.htm">How does Genesis 12:1 demonstrate God's call to obedience and faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_leaving_comfort_for_God_s_plan.htm">What does "Go from your country" teach about leaving comfort for God's plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Inspiration_from_Abraham_s_faith_journey.htm">How can Abraham's response in Genesis 12:1 inspire our own faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Who_else_left_home_for_God_s_purpose.htm">What other biblical figures were called to leave their homeland for God's purpose?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Genesis_12_1_trust_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of trust from Genesis 12:1 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Gen_12_1_reveal_about_God_s_call.htm">What does Genesis 12:1 reveal about God's call to Abram?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_12_1_Faith_and_obedience.htm">How does Genesis 12:1 challenge our understanding of faith and obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Abram_chosen_by_God_in_Genesis.htm">Why did God choose Abram in Genesis 12:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/am_i_ready_to_be_sent.htm">Am I ready to be sent?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_illegal_immigration.htm">What does the Bible say about illegal immigration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/did_god_separate_from_israel.htm">Did God separate from Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_christ_surpass_the_old_covenant.htm">How does Christ fulfill and surpass the old covenant?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Genesis 12:1 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD said to Abram</b><p>God initiates the conversation. Abram is not looking for the LORD; the LORD graciously breaks into Abram&#8217;s life. This pattern of divine initiative appears all through Scripture&#8212;God speaks first (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>; <a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4</a>). <a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2-3</a> confirms that the Lord of glory appeared to Abram while he was still in Mesopotamia. The call is personal, unmistakable, and authoritative, revealing a God who directs history and individuals alike.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Leave your country</b><p>The first demand is geographic. Ur (and later Haran) represent a sophisticated, idolatrous culture (<a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>). God is asking Abram to exchange the security of a known homeland for a promise he cannot yet see. <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a> highlights Abram&#8217;s faith: &#8220;By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.&#8221; Faith, in Scripture, often requires stepping away before stepping into.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your kindred</b><p>Beyond land, God calls Abram to separate from familiar relationships&#8212;clan loyalties that once defined identity. Jesus echoes this priority when He says, &#8220;Anyone who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>). Detaching from kindred does not imply abandonment of love; it reorders allegiances so God holds first place. Later, Abram will intercede passionately for family (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>), proving that devotion to God heightens, not diminishes, genuine love for others.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your father&#8217;s household</b><p>This command strikes even deeper. Terah&#8217;s household likely practiced idolatry (<a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a>). God disentangles Abram from inherited patterns so He can form a new covenant family. In <a href="/luke/9-59.htm">Luke 9:59-62</a> Jesus presents a similar radical call, underscoring that the kingdom has no room for half-measures. Obedience here lays the groundwork for the future nation that will bless all nations (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go to the land I will show you</b><p>The destination is unnamed&#8212;God alone knows it. This open-ended journey requires ongoing trust, not a one-time decision. <a href="/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a> reaffirms the promise, and <a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a> notes that Abraham lived in tents, looking forward to a city with foundations whose architect is God. The call shapes a pilgrim mindset: believers travel light, guided by God&#8217;s daily direction (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a> captures a decisive, life-altering call. God speaks first, summoning Abram to leave place, people, and past for a future only God can define. Each clause deepens the cost and the trust required, but also hints at the staggering blessing to come. The verse models how saving faith listens, obeys, and walks into the unknown because the known God is leading the way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now the Lord had said unto Abram</span>.--Heb., <span class= "ital">And Jehovah said unto Abram. </span>There is no new beginning; but having briefly sketched the family from which Abram sprang, and indicated that he had inherited from them the right of primogeniture, the narrative next proceeds to the primary purpose of the Told&#162;th Terah, which is to show how in Abram Jehovah prepared for the fulfilment, through Israel, of the prote-vangelium contained in the promise made to Eve at the fall (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>). The rendering "had said" was doubtless adopted because of St. Stephen's words (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>); but it is the manner of the Biblical narrative to revert to the original starting point.<p><span class= "bld">Thy country.</span>--A proof that Abram and his father were no new settlers at Ur, but that the race of Shem had at this time long held sway there, as is now known to have been the case.<p><span class= "bld">Thy kindred.</span>--This rendering is supported by <a href="/genesis/43-7.htm" title="And they said, The man asked us straightly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?">Genesis 43:7</a>; but it more probably means <span class= "ital">thy birthplace. </span>It is the word translated "nativity" in <a href="/genesis/11-28.htm" title="And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.">Genesis 11:28</a>. where its meaning is settled by the prefixed "land;" and the sense is probably the same here. If so, the command certainly came to Abram at Ur, though most of the versions suppose that it happened at Haran. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5.</span> - Designed to trace the outward development of God's kingdom on the earth, the narrative now concentrates its attention on one of the foregoing Terachites, whose remarkable career it sketches with considerable minuteness of detail, from the period of his emigration from Chaldea to his death at Hebron in the land of Canaan. Distinguished as a man of undoubted superiority both of character and mind, the head of at least two powerful and important races, and standing, as one might say, on the threshold of the historical era, it is yet chiefly as his life and fortunes connect with the Divine purpose of salvation that they find a place in the inspired record. The progress of infidelity during the four centuries that had elapsed since the Flood, the almost universal corruption of even the Shemits portion of the human family, had conclusively demonstrated the necessity of a second Divine interposition, if the knowledge of salvation were not to be completely banished from the earth. Accordingly, the son of Terah was selected to be the founder of a new nation, in which the light of gospel truth might be deposited for preservation until the fullness of the times, and through which the promise of the gospel might he conducted forward to its ultimate realization in the manifestation of the woman's seed. Partly to prepare him for the high destiny of being the progenitor of the chosen nation, and partly to illustrate the character of that gospel with which he was to be entrusted, he was summoned to renounce his native country and kinsmen in Chaldaea, and venture forth upon an untried journey in obedience to the call of Heaven, to a land which he should afterward receive for an inheritance. In a series of successive theophanies or Divine manifestations, around which the various incidents of his life are grouped - in Ur of the Chaldees (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), at Moreh in Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), near Bethel (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 13.), at Mature (ibid. 15, 17.), and on Moriah (ibid. 22.) - he is distinctly promised three things - a land, a seed, and a blessing - as the reward of his compliance with the heavenly invitation; and the confident persuasion both of the reality of these gracious promises and of the Divine ability and willingness to fulfill them forms the animating spirit and guiding principle of his being in every situation of life, whether of trial or of difficulty, in which he is subsequently placed. The miraculous character of these theophanies indeed has been made a ground on which to assail the entire patriarchal history as unhistorical. By certain writers they have been represented as nothing more than natural occurrences embellished by the genius of the author of Genesis (Eichhorn, Bauer, Winer), as belonging to the domain of poetical fiction (De Wette), and therefore as undeserving of anything like serious consideration. But unless the supernatural is <span class="accented">to be in toto</span> eliminated from the record, a concession which cannot possibly be granted by an enlightened theism, the Divine appearances to Abraham cannot be regarded as in any degree militating against the historical veracity of the story of his life, which, it may be said, is amply vouched for by the harmony of its details with the characteristics of the period to which it belongs (cf. Havernick's 'Introduction,' &sect; 18). Nor does the employment of the name Jehovah in connection with these theophanies warrant the conclusion that the passages containing them are interpolations of a post Mosaic or Jehovistic editor (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson). "Such a hypothesis," says Keil, "can only be maintained by those who' misunderstand the distinctive meaning of the two names, Elohim and Jehovah (q.v. on Genesis 2:4), and arbitrarily set aside the Jehovah in <a href="/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>, on account of an erroneous determination of the relation in which El Shaddai stands to Jehovah." Indications of the literary unity of the patriarchal history will be noted, and replies to objections given, in the progress of the Exposition. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Lord.</span> Jehovah = the God of salvation, an indication that the narrative is now to specially concern itself with the chosen seed, and the Deity to discover himself as the God of redemption. The hypothesis that vers. 1-4 were inserted in the fundamental document by the Jehovist editor is not required for a satisfactory explanation of the change of the Divine name at this particular stage of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Had said</span>. Literally, said. In Ur of the Chaldees, according to Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>), reverting, after the usual manner of the writer, to the original point of departure in the Abrahamic history (Aben Ezra, Mede, Piscator, Pererius, Calvin, Willet, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Dathins, Alford, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary'); or in Haran, after Terah's death, as the first call given to the patriarch (LXX., Chaldee, Syriac, Raschi, Lyra, Keil, Kalisch, Dykes), or as a repetition of the call addressed to him in Ur (Clarke, Wordsworth, Inglis). Luther conjectures that the call in Ur was given "<span class="accented">fortasse per patti</span>. <span class="accented">archam Shem</span>;" but if the authority of Stephen be recognized, this was the occasion of the first theophany vouchsafed to Abram. <span class="cmt_word">Get thee out.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">go for thyself</span>, a frequent Hebraism, expressive of the way in which the action of the verb returns upon itself, is terminated and completed (cf. <a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="/songs/2-11.htm">Song of Solomon 2:11</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrew Syntax,' &sect; 314); hence, though not necessarily emphatic, it may be equivalent to "Go thou," whoever else remains behind (Jarchi, Ainsworth, Bush). <span class="cmt_word">Of thy country</span>. A proof that the date of the call was while Abram was in Ur (Calvin), though if Ur was at Edessa (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) the patriarch could scarcely have been said to be from home. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy kindred.</span> At Ur in all probability Nahor and Milcah were left behind; at Haran, Nahor and his family, if they had already arrived thither, and according to some (Kalisch, Dykes) Terah also. <span class="cmt_word">And from thy father's house.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> if they will not accompany thee. No Divine interdict forbade the other members of the family of Terah joining in the Abrahamic emigration. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">land that I will show thee.</span> Through a revelation (Lange), or simply by the guidance of providence. The land itself is left unnamed for the trial of the patriarch's faith, which, if it sustained the proof, was to be rewarded by the exceeding great and precious promises which follow: - according to one arrangement, seven in number, one for each clause of the next two verses (Cajetan, Willet); according to another, four, corresponding to the clauses of the second verse, the last of which is expanded in the third (Keil); according to a third, six, forming three pairs of parallels (Alford); according to a fourth, and perhaps the best, two, a lower or personal blessing, comprising the first three particulars, and a higher or public blessing, embracing the last three (Murphy). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
