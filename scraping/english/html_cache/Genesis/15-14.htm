The judgment on Egypt is fulfilled in the narrative of the Exodus, where God sends plagues to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites (Exodus 7-12). This judgment demonstrates God's sovereignty and justice, as He holds nations accountable for their actions. The concept of divine judgment is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing God's role as the ultimate judge of nations and individuals (<a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7-8</a>).<p><b>and afterward they will depart with many possessions</b><br>This prophecy is fulfilled in <a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>, where the Israelites leave Egypt with silver, gold, and clothing given to them by the Egyptians. This transfer of wealth signifies God's provision and blessing upon His people, as well as a form of recompense for their years of slavery. The departure with possessions also prefigures the ultimate deliverance and inheritance believers receive through Christ, who liberates from the bondage of sin and grants spiritual riches (<a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3-14</a>).
