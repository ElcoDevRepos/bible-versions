The giving of a servant girl as part of a marriage arrangement was customary in ancient Near Eastern cultures, reflecting the social and economic structures of the time. Zilpah, whose name means "frailty" or "drooping," becomes an important character in the unfolding story of Jacob's family, as she later bears children who become part of the twelve tribes of Israel. This act of giving a servant girl highlights the patriarchal and hierarchical nature of the society, where servants were considered part of the household property.<p><b>to his daughter Leah</b><br>Leah, the elder daughter of Laban, is central to the narrative of Jacob's marriages. Her marriage to Jacob, achieved through Laban's deception, sets the stage for the complex family dynamics that follow. Leah's role as the less favored wife contrasts with her sister Rachel, yet she becomes the mother of six of Jacob's sons, including Judah, from whom the line of David and ultimately Jesus Christ descends. This connection underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and grace, working through human imperfection to fulfill His promises.<p><b>as her maidservant</b><br>The term "maidservant" indicates Zilpah's role and status within the household. Maidservants were often given to daughters as part of their dowry, serving both practical and symbolic purposes. In Leah's case, Zilpah's presence would have been intended to assist with household duties and child-rearing. The inclusion of maidservants in the family structure also reflects the broader cultural practices of the time, where such arrangements were common. Zilpah's later role as a surrogate mother, bearing children for Jacob, parallels the story of Hagar and Ishmael, illustrating recurring themes of rivalry, divine intervention, and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises through unexpected means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>The father of Leah and Rachel, and the brother of Rebekah.
