The number seven is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The seven cows represent seven years, as Joseph later explains. The sickly, ugly, and thin cows symbolize a period of famine that will follow seven years of abundance. Cows were a common symbol of fertility and prosperity in ancient Egypt, making their sickly appearance particularly ominous. This imagery underscores the severity of the impending famine. The dream's setting by the Nile River, a lifeline for Egypt, emphasizes the nation's dependence on agriculture and the devastating impact of a failed harvest.<p><b>I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!</b><br>This statement highlights the unprecedented nature of the coming famine. Egypt, known for its fertile land and agricultural wealth, had likely never experienced such a severe shortage. The emphasis on the ugliness of the cows serves to stress the unnatural and alarming nature of the vision. This phrase also reflects Pharaoh's genuine concern and the urgency of the situation, prompting him to seek an interpretation. The severity of the famine can be seen as a divine warning, and Joseph's role in interpreting the dream foreshadows his rise to power and his role as a savior figure, prefiguring Christ's role as a

Mean</div><b>After them</b><p>- The phrase links this scene directly to the first part of Pharaoh&#8217;s dream (<a href="/genesis/41-17.htm">Genesis 41:17&#8211;18</a>), where healthy, well-fed cows came up from the Nile.<p>- Scripture often uses sequential imagery to signal a divine contrast or impending reversal (e.g., <a href="/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31&#8211;35</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24&#8211;30</a>).<p>- By showing what follows &#8220;after,&#8221; God highlights the certainty of an ordered plan&#8212;first abundance, then adversity (cf. <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven other cows</b><p>- The number seven repeatedly marks completeness in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15</a>). Here it pictures a full, divinely appointed season.<p>- &#8220;Other&#8221; distinguishes these cows from the first seven, stressing that the two sets must be kept separate in meaning&#8212;prosperity and famine will be distinct, not mingled (<a href="/genesis/41-29.htm">Genesis 41:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>- Just as Joseph later interprets, these seven represent seven literal years; God is revealing His calendar, not a vague symbol (<a href="/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sickly, ugly, and thin</b><p>- Three descriptors hammer home a single truth: utter lack. The Hebrew narrative piles on adjectives the way famine piles on misery (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>).<p>- Each term is the opposite of the earlier &#8220;healthy and well-fed&#8221; cows, underscoring how sharply the tide will turn (<a href="/genesis/41-18.htm">Genesis 41:18</a> vs. 41:19).<p>- Scripture often pairs outward appearance with inward condition; here Egypt&#8217;s agricultural lifeblood will be visibly drained (<a href="/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/haggai/1-11.htm">Haggai 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came up</b><p>- Just as the first cows &#8220;came up from the Nile,&#8221; these emaciated cows rise from the same source (<a href="/genesis/41-2.htm">Genesis 41:2</a>). Both blessing and hardship flow from places we normally rely on, reminding us God alone is the fountain of provision or restraint (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27&#8211;29</a>).<p>- Their emergence shows famine is not random but sent on schedule, &#8220;coming up&#8221; under divine permission (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!</b><p>- Pharaoh&#8217;s exclamation highlights the unprecedented nature of the coming catastrophe (<a href="/exodus/10-14.htm">Exodus 10:14, 14</a>:24).<p>- Egypt was famed for fertile crops and well-fed livestock (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>); this vision shocks even its ruler, suggesting nationwide collapse (<a href="/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5&#8211;10</a>).<p>- The king&#8217;s words confirm the dream&#8217;s realism. God is not merely offering a metaphor but forecasting an event that will surpass human memory (<a href="/genesis/41-30.htm">Genesis 41:30</a>; <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-19.htm">Genesis 41:19</a> paints the second half of Pharaoh&#8217;s dream in stark, unforgettable strokes: following years of plenty, a complete, God-appointed span of famine will rise from the same Nile that once provided abundance. By stressing the cows&#8217; sickly appearance and Pharaoh&#8217;s utter astonishment, the text underscores how sudden, severe, and unparalleled the hardship will be. God reveals this in advance so that wise stewardship&#8212;embodied later in Joseph&#8212;may preserve life and display the Lord&#8217;s sovereign control over prosperity and adversity alike (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Poor and very ill-favoured and leanfleshed.</span>--Pharaoh, in his recital, describes his dreams at greater length than is the case in the narrative (<a href="/context/genesis/41-2.htm" title="And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow.">Genesis 41:2-7</a>), and also mentions the impressions made upon his imagination by what he had seen, as, for instance, that he had never beheld such lean cattle, and that they were as wretched in look after eating up the fat kine as before.
