It signifies Abraham's recognition of God's authority and his own humility. This posture is consistent with the cultural practices of the ancient Near East, where bowing or prostrating oneself was a common expression of respect and worship.<p><b>Then he laughed and said to himself,</b><br>Abraham's laughter can be interpreted as a mix of astonishment and incredulity. In the biblical context, laughter often accompanies the announcement of miraculous births (e.g., <a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>, <a href="/luke/1-18.htm">Luke 1:18</a>). This internal dialogue reflects a moment of human doubt and wonder at God's promise, highlighting the tension between faith and skepticism. The laughter is not necessarily one of disbelief but rather a reaction to the extraordinary nature of God's promise.<p><b>&#8220;Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?</b><br>Abraham's question underscores the improbability of the situation from a human perspective. At this point in the narrative, Abraham is 99 years old (<a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17:1</a>), and the promise of a son seems biologically impossible. This highlights the theme of God's power to fulfill His promises despite natural limitations, a recurring motif in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19-21</a>). The question also serves to emphasize the miraculous nature of Isaac's birth, prefiguring the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ.<p><b>Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?&#8221;</b><br>Sarah's age further compounds the improbability of the promise, as she is well beyond the typical childbearing years. This detail emphasizes the miraculous intervention required for the fulfillment of God's covenant. The cultural context of the time placed great importance on lineage and descendants, making the promise of a son particularly significant. This moment foreshadows the New Testament theme of God's ability to bring life from barrenness, as seen in the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth (<a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7, 36</a>-37).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Originally named Abram, he is the central figure in this passage.

Falling facedown shows awe before the Almighty, just as Abram had done earlier when God first spoke of covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs falling on one&#8217;s face with worship and submission: Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>), Joshua before the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>), the elders in heaven (<a href="/revelation/7-11.htm">Revelation 7:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s act signals wholehearted reverence and readiness to hear, even when the promise stretches reason.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he laughed</b><p>&#8220;Then he laughed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>b).<p>&#8226; Laughter can spring from joy, surprise, or incredulity. Here it mingles all three. God has just said, &#8220;Sarah your wife will bear you a son&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19-21</a> reminds us that Abraham &#8220;did not waver in unbelief&#8221; but grew strong in faith. His laughter, then, is not cynical; it is the startled delight of a man overwhelmed by grace.<p>&#8226; This is holy laughter that looks forward to Isaac, whose very name means &#8220;He laughs&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-3.htm">Genesis 21:3</a>,6). God turns wonder into testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And said to himself</b><p>&#8220;He&#8230;said to himself&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>c).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s thoughts are voiced inwardly, yet God records them. <a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a> affirms, &#8220;Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Silent meditations still matter. God is attentive to the quiet corners of the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/luke/5-22.htm">Luke 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment reminds us that faith wrestles honestly within, bringing private concerns into the light of divine promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?</b><p>&#8220;Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>d).<p>&#8226; The question states the obvious impossibility: Abraham is &#8220;as good as dead&#8221; physically (<a href="/hebrews/11-12.htm">Hebrews 11:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God delights in impossibilities. He &#8220;gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist&#8221; (<a href="/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; From Noah&#8217;s ark to the parting of the Red Sea, Scripture repeatedly shows that human limitation is the stage for divine power (<a href="/jeremiah/32-27.htm">Jeremiah 32:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?</b><p>&#8220;Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>e).<p>&#8226; Sarah&#8217;s barrenness had defined decades of disappointment (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>). At ninety, every natural hope was gone.<p>&#8226; God answers in advance: &#8220;Is anything too difficult for the LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>). Centuries later, Gabriel echoes the same truth to Mary: &#8220;Nothing will be impossible with God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The promised son will carry the covenant line (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>); his miraculous birth prefigures later wonders, pointing to the ultimate Child of promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a> captures reverent awe, joyful astonishment, and honest reflection as Abraham encounters a promise humanly impossible yet divinely guaranteed. His face in the dust acknowledges God&#8217;s sovereignty; his laughter celebrates unexpected grace; his inner questions highlight the gap between human weakness and God&#8217;s limitless power. The verse invites confidence that when the LORD speaks, even the most unlikely word will unfailingly come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Abraham . . . laughed.</span>--The Jewish interpreters regard Abraham's laugh as one of joy, and Sarah's (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm" title="Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?">Genesis 18:12</a>) as one of unbelief. We may, however, well doubt whether there really was this difference between them; but our Lord confirms the View that joy was uppermost in Abraham's heart (<a href="/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>). Still with belief there was surprise, and the feeling that what was promised was so strange as to be well-nigh incredible. One who was ready to sacrifice his only son at God's word (<a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm" title="Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from where also he received him in a figure.">Hebrews 11:19</a>) would not be staggered by this strangeness, and yet the thought of Sarah's bearing a child at the age of ninety might easily present itself to his mind in a ludicrous aspect. As for Sarah, there is no proof that at the time when she laughed she knew or even suspected that the three travellers were more than men. She overheard their conversation, and laughed, imagining perhaps that they did not know how old she was. Really, the idea brought out by this double laughter is that Isaac's birth was contrary to nature.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Abraham fell upon his face</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">and laughed.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>, to laugh.
