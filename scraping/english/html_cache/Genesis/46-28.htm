Judah's leadership role is significant, as he previously offered himself as a surety for Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>). This act foreshadows the prominence of the tribe of Judah, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ, the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>), would come. Judah's role here also reflects a restoration of his character after his earlier failings, such as his involvement in selling Joseph into slavery (<a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26-27</a>).<p><b>to get directions to Goshen</b><br>Goshen is a fertile region in Egypt, suitable for Jacob's family and their livestock. This area is strategically chosen, as it allows the Israelites to remain distinct from the Egyptians, who considered shepherds detestable (<a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>). The choice of Goshen fulfills God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The request for directions underscores the humility and dependence on God&#8217;s guidance, as Jacob's family enters a new phase of their journey.<p><b>When Jacob&#8217;s family arrived in the land of Goshen</b><br>The arrival in Goshen marks the beginning of the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt, setting the stage for the events of the Exodus. This move is part of God's providential plan to grow Israel into a great nation (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3</a>). The land of Goshen serves as a place of refuge and blessing during the famine, illustrating God's provision and faithfulness. This moment also connects to the broader narrative of redemption, as it foreshadows the eventual deliverance of Israel from Egypt, a type of Christ's deliverance of humanity from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, father of the twelve tribes.
