This indicates a level of trust and authority given to Joseph, despite his status as a prisoner. Potiphar's role as captain of the guard suggests he was responsible for the security of Pharaoh's interests, including the prison. Joseph's assignment to care for the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, both high-ranking officials, highlights his administrative skills and God's favor upon him. This trust foreshadows Joseph's future rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>and he became their personal attendant</b><br>Joseph's role as a personal attendant to these officials demonstrates his humility and willingness to serve, even in difficult circumstances. This service-oriented attitude is a recurring theme in Joseph's life and is reflective of the biblical principle that those who are faithful in small things will be entrusted with greater responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). Joseph's service also prefigures Christ, who came not to be served, but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>After they had been in custody for some time</b><br>The phrase "for some time" suggests a period of waiting and uncertainty, which is a common experience for many biblical figures. This waiting period is significant as it sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan through dreams and their interpretations. It also mirrors the theme of patience and endurance found throughout Scripture, such as in the lives of Abraham and David. The delay in their release serves to highlight God's perfect timing in bringing about His purposes, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man sold into slavery by his brothers, who rose to a position of trust in Potiphar's house and later in the prison.
