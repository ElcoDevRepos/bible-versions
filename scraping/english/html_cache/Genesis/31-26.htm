Laban, Jacob's father-in-law, is a key figure in Jacob's life, having employed him for many years. The context here is that Jacob has fled from Laban's household with his family and possessions. This confrontation occurs after Laban catches up with Jacob, highlighting the tension and unresolved issues between them. Laban's approach is accusatory, setting the stage for a discussion about family, loyalty, and divine intervention.<p><b>&#8220;What have you done?</b><br>Laban's question is rhetorical, expressing his shock and disapproval of Jacob's actions. This echoes earlier biblical narratives where similar questions are posed in moments of betrayal or misunderstanding, such as God's question to Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>. It underscores the gravity of Jacob's departure and the perceived breach of trust. The question also reflects the cultural importance of family honor and the expectation of transparency in familial relationships.<p><b>You have deceived me</b><br>Deception is a recurring theme in Jacob's life, from his acquisition of Esau's birthright to his dealings with Laban. This accusation is ironic, considering Laban's own history of deceit, particularly in the marriage of Leah and Rachel to Jacob. The theme of deception serves as a reminder of the moral complexities in human relationships and the consequences of deceitful actions. It also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and transformation in Jacob's character.<p><b>and carried off my daughters</b><br>Laban refers to Rachel and Leah, who are both Jacob's wives and Laban's daughters. The phrase "carried off" suggests an act of force or abduction, though Jacob's actions were motivated by a desire to return to his homeland. This reflects the patriarchal society of the time, where daughters were often seen as possessions of their father until marriage. The familial dynamics here are complex, involving issues of loyalty, autonomy, and the rights of women within the family structure.<p><b>like captives of war!</b><br>This simile emphasizes the severity of Laban's accusation, likening Jacob's actions to those of a conqueror taking spoils. It highlights the emotional intensity of the situation and Laban's perception of loss and betrayal. The imagery of captives of war also connects to broader biblical themes of exile and redemption, as seen in the Israelites' later experiences. It underscores the tension between human conflict and divine providence, as God ultimately guides Jacob's journey and fulfills His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's mother, and thus Jacob's uncle.

His words reveal:<p>&#8226; a father-in-law&#8217;s wounded pride&#8212;similar to how Abimelech confronted Abraham in <a href="/genesis/20-9.htm">Genesis 20:9</a>.<p>&#8226; a household drama that Scripture presents as real history, not legend. Laban&#8217;s speech takes place in the hills of Gilead (<a href="/genesis/31-21.htm">Genesis 31:21</a>), reminding us that God had already warned him in a dream the night before (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>). Even so, Laban proceeds to accuse, exposing the tension between divine restraint and human stubbornness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What have you done?</b><p>This question is an outcry of shock and accusation, the same phrase Pharaoh used with Abram (<a href="/genesis/12-18.htm">Genesis 12:18</a>) and Abimelech used with Isaac (<a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>). In each case, the interrogator feels wronged and believes the offender&#8217;s actions threaten social order. Laban frames himself as the victim, ignoring God&#8217;s directive not to &#8220;speak to Jacob &#8230; good or evil&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have deceived me</b><p>Irony drips from Laban&#8217;s charge. Years earlier he deceived Jacob by swapping Leah for Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-25.htm">Genesis 29:25</a>). Now he reaps what he sowed (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Scripture consistently records the principle that deceit inevitably circles back on the deceiver (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>). Jacob&#8217;s stealthy departure (<a href="/genesis/31-20.htm">Genesis 31:20</a>) was indeed deceptive, yet Laban&#8217;s complaint exposes his own history of manipulation (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And carried off my daughters</b><p>Laban speaks as though his adult daughters are still his property, ignoring God&#8217;s creational design that &#8220;a man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Rachel and Leah themselves declare that their father &#8220;has treated us like strangers&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-14.htm">Genesis 31:14-16</a>). While Laban accuses Jacob of theft, Scripture shows the women left willingly, aligning with the covenantal shift from Laban&#8217;s household to Jacob&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like captives of war!</b><p>This militaristic image dramatizes Laban&#8217;s sense of loss. In reality, no violence occurred; Jacob&#8217;s family simply obeyed God&#8217;s command to return to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>). Laban&#8217;s exaggerated language mirrors Saul&#8217;s later claim that David had &#8220;incited my servant against me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>). Such hyperbole exposes a controlling heart: Laban cannot imagine his daughters choosing freedom, so he casts Jacob as a raider.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-26.htm">Genesis 31:26</a> captures the moment Laban confronts Jacob with accusations of deception and kidnapping. Each phrase unveils Laban&#8217;s wounded pride, ironic self-indictment, and controlling nature, while simultaneously highlighting God&#8217;s faithfulness to guide Jacob home. The verse reminds us that human schemes cannot overturn God&#8217;s covenant purposes, and that those who practice deceit often face the very charges they level against others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26-30) <span class= "bld">Laban said . . . --</span>Laban reproaches Jacob, first, for carrying away his daughters secretly, which was an affront to them (<a href="/genesis/31-26.htm" title="And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done, that you have stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?">Genesis 31:26</a>) and an injury to his own feelings (<a href="/genesis/31-28.htm" title="And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.">Genesis 31:28</a>); secondly, he tells him that he should have punished him but for the Divine warning; lastly, he accuses him of stealing his teraphim.<p><span class= "bld">Captives . . . --</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">captives of the sword, </span>women carried off in war as spoil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban</span> (assuming a tone of injured innocence) <span class="cmt_word">said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me,</span> - literally, and (meaning, in that) <span class="accented">thou hast stolen my heart</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>, ver. 20; and cf. ver. 27) - <span class="cmt_word">and carried away</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 18<span class="cmt_word">) my daughters, as captives taken with the sword?</span> Literally, as <span class="accented">captives of the sword</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">invitis parentibus</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller); language which, if not hypocritical on Laban's part, was certainly hyperbolical, since he had already evinced the strength of his parental affection by selling his daughters to Jacob; and besides, so far as it concerned either Jacob or his wives, it was quite untrue, Rachel and Leah having voluntarily accompanied their husband in his flight. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore didst thou floe away secretly,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">wherefore didst thou hide thyself to flee away</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> (niph.), with an inf. following, corresponding to the similar construction in Greek of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> with a part, and being correctly rendered in English by an adverb (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 142) - <span class="cmt_word">and steal away from me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and steal me</span>, ut supra); <span class="cmt_word">and didst not tell me, that I might</span> (literally, and I <span class="accented">would</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs,</span> - in Oriental countries those about to make a long journey are still sent away <span class="accented">cantionibus et musicorum instrumentorum concentu</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller) - <span class="cmt_word">with tabret</span>, - the toph was a drum or timbrel, consisting of a wooden circle covered with membrane, and furnished with brass bells (like the modern tambourine), which Oriental women beat when dancing (cf. <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and with harp</span>!

It is perhaps judging Laban too severely to pronounce this complete hypocrisy and cant (Alford, Bush, Candlish, Gerlach), but equally wide of the truth is it to see in Laban's conduct nothing but generosity of feeling (Kalisch); probably there was a mixture of both paternal affection and crafty dissimulation (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</span> The charge of folly in Old Testament Scriptures commonly carries with it an imputation of wrong-doing (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It is in the power of my hand</span> - so the phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>) is rendered by competent authorities (Gesenius, Furst, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kalisch, Murphy, <span class="accented">et alii</span>), with which agree laxly, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.), and <span class="accented">valet manus men</span> (Vulgate), though the translation "My hand is for God," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. my hand serves me as God (cf. <a href="/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>), is by some preferred (Keil, Knobel, Jacobus) - <span class="cmt_word">to do you hurt: but the God of your father</span> - the use of this expression can be rightly regarded neither as a proof of Elohistic authorship (Tuch, Bleek, Colenso, Davidson) nor as a sign of Laban's spiritual degeneracy (Hengstenberg, Wordsworth), since it is practically equivalent to Jehovah (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>), but is probably to be viewed as a play upon the sound and sense of the preceding clause, as thus: - "It is in the El of my hand to do you evil, but the Elohim of your father spake to me." Another instance of this play upon the sound and sense is to be found in vers. 19, 20 - "Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's; and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Syrian" (cf. Quarry on Genesis, p. 498) - <span class="cmt_word">spake unto me yester night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob</span> - literally, <span class="accented">guard or keep thee for thyself</span> (the pleon, pron. being added <span class="accented">ut supra</span>, ver. 24) <span class="accented">from speaking with Jacob - <span class="cmt_word"></span>either good or bad</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone</span> (literally, <span class="accented">going thou didst go -</span> thou hast indeed gone), <span class="cmt_word">because thou sore longedst after thy father's house</span> (literally, <span class="accented">because desiring thou didst desire</span>. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, <span class="cmt_word">to be pale</span> (whence <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span>, silver, so called from its pale color), expresses the idea of pining away and languishing through strong inward longing), <span class="cmt_word">yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?</span> Laban had probably gone to consult his teraphim and so discovered their loss. Augustine calls attention to this as the first Scripture reference to heathen gods, and Calvin probably supplies the right explanation of the sense in which they were so styled by Laban, <span class="accented">non quia deitatem illie putaret esse inclusam</span>, <span class="accented">sed quia in honorem deorum imagines illas colebat</span>; <span class="accented">vel potius quod Deo sacra facturus</span>, <span class="accented">vertebat se ad illas imagines</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>). "This complaint of Laban, that his "gods were stolen, show-eth the vanity of such idolatry" (Ainsworth).
