This reflects his cautious approach in meeting Esau, whom he fears due to their past conflict over the birthright and blessing. The division into multiple groups could be seen as a way to appease Esau gradually, showing Jacob's humility and desire for reconciliation. This method of sending gifts in stages is a common diplomatic practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, aimed at softening the heart of a potentially hostile party.<p><b>&#8220;When you meet Esau, you are to say the same thing to him:</b><br>Jacob's instructions to his servants emphasize consistency in the message delivered to Esau. This repetition underscores the importance of the message and Jacob's intent to convey sincerity and submission. The phrase "the same thing" refers to the earlier message of peace and servitude, which Jacob hopes will pacify Esau's anger. This approach highlights the biblical principle of seeking peace and reconciliation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, "A gentle answer turns away wrath."
