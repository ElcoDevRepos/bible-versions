This reflects the social structures and family dynamics of the time. Timna's role as a concubine rather than a wife may indicate her lower social status or foreign origin. The mention of Amalek is significant, as he becomes the progenitor of the Amalekites, a group frequently in conflict with Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). The Amalekites are often seen as a symbol of opposition to God's people, and their enmity with Israel is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This connection to Esau, who sold his birthright, may symbolize a continuation of hostility towards the chosen line of Jacob.<p><b>These are the grandsons of Esau&#8217;s wife Adah.</b><br>Adah is one of Esau's wives, and her mention here ties the lineage of Amalek back to Esau, emphasizing the familial connections and the fulfillment of God's prophecy regarding Esau's descendants (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The genealogy highlights the complex family relationships and the fulfillment of God's promises and warnings. Esau's descendants, through Adah, are part of the broader narrative of the nations surrounding Israel, many of whom would become adversaries.

As Balaam describes Amalek as "the beginning of nations" (so the Heb., <a href="/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a>), the race can scarcely have had so ignoble an origin as to have sprung from a concubine of Eliphaz; for we gather from <a href="/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a> that the phrase used by Balaam implied precedence and nobility. It was, moreover, one of the most widely spread races of antiquity, occupying the whole country from Shur, on the borders of Egypt, to Havilah, in Arabia Felix. But probably there was a fusion of some of the Horites with the Amalekites, just as the Kenezites, under Caleb, were fused into the tribe of Judah. For in <a href="/context/1_chronicles/4-42.htm" title="And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.">1Chronicles 4:42-43</a>, we find the Simeonites invading Mount Seir, and smiting Amalekites there. Of these Amalekites in Seir, Amalek, the grandson of Esau, was probably the founder; for in <a href="/genesis/36-16.htm" title="Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.">Genesis 36:16</a> he is called <span class= "ital">a duke, </span>and therefore one district of the country would belong to his descendants, in the same manner as each son of Jacob had a territory called after his name. In this district the chiefs would be Semites of the race of Esau; the mass of the people a blended race of Horites. and Amalekites. There is no difficulty in the absence of their names from Genesis 10. Though Balaam magnified them, they were regarded by Israel, not as a nation, but as a hateful horde of plunderers.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/36-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Additionally, Timna,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;
