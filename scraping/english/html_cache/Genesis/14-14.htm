Dan is about 140 miles from Hebron, where Abram began his march.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Abram heard that his brother</span> - so called as his brother's son, or simply as his relative (<a href="/genesis/42-8.htm">Genesis 42:8</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">was taken captive, he</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and he</span> - <span class="cmt_word">armed</span> - literally, <span class="accented">caused to pour forth, i.e.</span> drew out in a body, from a toot signifying "to pour out" (Gesenius, Furst); from a root meaning to unsheath or draw out anything as from a scabbard, and hence equivalent to <span class="accented">expedivit</span>, he got ready (Onkelos, Saadias, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'). Kalisch connects both senses with the root.

Murphy regards Dan as the original designation of the town, which was changed under the Sidonians to Laish (lion), and restored at the conquest. Clericus suggests that the Jordan fountain may have been styled Dan, "Judge," and the neighboring town Laish, and that the Danites, observing the coincidence of the former with the name of their own tribe, gave it to the city they had conquered. Alford is doubtful whether <span class="accented">Dan-juan was</span> really different from Laish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when Abram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_87.htm">Strong's 87: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abram -- 'exalted father', the original name of Abraham</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
