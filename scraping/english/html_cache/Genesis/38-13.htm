In the ancient Near Eastern context, communication often relied on word of mouth. Tamar's awareness of Judah's movements suggests she was attentive to her circumstances, possibly due to her precarious position as a widow awaiting fulfillment of levirate marriage obligations.<p><b>&#8220;Your father-in-law</b><br>Judah, Tamar's father-in-law, is a significant figure in the narrative. As one of the sons of Jacob, he holds a prominent place in the lineage of Israel. The relationship between Judah and Tamar is central to the unfolding of God's plan, as their eventual union leads to the birth of Perez, an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><b>is going up to Timnah</b><br>Timnah was a town located in the hill country of Judah. The phrase "going up" reflects the geographical elevation of Timnah relative to the surrounding areas. This journey indicates a routine activity, as shearing sheep was a common agricultural practice. The mention of Timnah also connects to other biblical events, such as Samson's interactions with the Philistines in <a href="/judges/14.htm">Judges 14</a>.<p><b>to shear his sheep,&#8221;</b><br>Sheep shearing was a significant economic and social event in ancient times, often accompanied by festivities. It was a time of harvest and celebration, providing an opportunity for community gatherings. This context sets the stage for Tamar's plan to secure her rights within Judah's family, highlighting her resourcefulness and determination. The act of shearing sheep also symbolizes a time of transformation and renewal, paralleling the changes in Tamar's life and her role in the lineage of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The widow of Er, Judah's firstborn, and later the widow of Onan.

Scripture underscores how God often moves through ordinary information shared at just the right moment (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/25-14.htm">1 Samuel 25:14</a>; <a href="/esther/4-7.htm">Esther 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Tamar is not acting on rumor but on factual word concerning Judah&#8217;s movements, showing that her later actions are premeditated yet grounded in truth.<p>&#8226; Like Rahab who responds to what she &#8220;heard&#8221; about Israel (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>), Tamar acts decisively once she knows what is happening.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your father-in-law</b><p>&#8226; The phrase clarifies relationship and covenant duty. Judah is responsible for Tamar&#8217;s welfare under the levirate obligation (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>; compare <a href="/ruth/1-11.htm">Ruth 1:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming him &#8220;father-in-law,&#8221; the text spotlights Judah&#8217;s accountability; Tamar&#8217;s plight is rooted in his failure to give her Shelah as husband (<a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11, 14</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently holds family heads answerable for righteousness within the household (<a href="/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is going up to Timnah</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Going up&#8221; reflects literal ascent from the valley of Adullam toward the hill country town of Timnah, reminding us the events are historical and geographic (<a href="/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10, 57</a>).<p>&#8226; Timnah is a shearing center, later connected with Samson (<a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-2</a>). Not a random location, it becomes the stage where Judah&#8217;s character is revealed, much like Bethel for Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Movement in Genesis often signals a turning point: Abram &#8220;went up&#8221; from Egypt (<a href="/genesis/13-1.htm">Genesis 13:1</a>); Jacob &#8220;went up&#8221; to Beersheba (<a href="/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1</a>). Here Judah&#8217;s ascent will precipitate God&#8217;s corrective work in his lineage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to shear his sheep</b><p>&#8226; Sheep-shearing in Scripture is more than farm labor; it is a festive, lucrative season (<a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2-8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Such gatherings included feasting and often moral laxity&#8212;conditions that expose Judah to temptation, just as Nabal&#8217;s shearing feast displayed his folly (<a href="/1_samuel/25-36.htm">1 Samuel 25:36-38</a>).<p>&#8226; The text prepares us for Tamar&#8217;s strategic plan: she knows Judah will be relaxed, wealthy, and off guard, paralleling how circumstances positioned Lot&#8217;s daughters (<a href="/genesis/19-33.htm">Genesis 19:33-35</a>) and later Abigail (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-20</a>).<p>&#8226; God will sovereignly use this setting to secure the messianic line through Perez (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-13.htm">Genesis 38:13</a> pinpoints the moment Tamar learns of Judah&#8217;s journey, spotlighting Judah&#8217;s duty, the literal route to Timnah, and the culturally charged sheep-shearing festival. By acting on this knowledge, Tamar steps into God&#8217;s providential plan, exposing Judah&#8217;s failure and ensuring the continuation of the chosen lineage. The verse reminds us that God orchestrates even everyday news and routine events to accomplish His righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was told Tamer, saying, Behold thy father in-law</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, a father-in-law, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, unused, to join together.
