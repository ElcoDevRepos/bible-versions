The imagery of cows is significant in ancient Egypt, where cattle were a symbol of wealth and prosperity. The sickly and thin cows represent a period of famine, while the well-fed cows symbolize years of abundance. This dream foreshadows the seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine in Egypt. The act of the thin cows devouring the well-fed ones suggests the severity of the famine, which would consume the surplus of the abundant years. This imagery also highlights the theme of divine revelation through dreams, a common motif in the Joseph narrative. The dream's interpretation by Joseph demonstrates God's sovereignty and His ability to reveal future events to His chosen servants.<p><b>Then Pharaoh woke up,</b><br>Pharaoh waking up signifies the end of the dream and the beginning of his quest for understanding its meaning. In the ancient Near East, dreams were often considered messages from the divine, and Pharaoh's reaction indicates the importance he placed on this vision. His inability to interpret the dream himself or through his magicians sets the stage for Joseph's rise to power. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it leads to Joseph's introduction to Pharaoh and his eventual appointment as a ruler in Egypt. The waking of Pharaoh can also be seen as a metaphor for the awakening of God's plan for Joseph and the preservation of the Israelites during the coming famine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places
