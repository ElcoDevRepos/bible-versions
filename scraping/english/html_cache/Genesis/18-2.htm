Abraham's immediate recognition and response to the presence of these three men highlight his adherence to this cultural norm. The identity of these men is significant; they are later revealed to be the Lord and two angels (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1, 19</a>:1). This encounter is a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to a human. The number three has been interpreted by some as a foreshadowing of the Trinity, although this is not explicitly stated in the text. The appearance of these men "nearby" suggests a sudden and divine presence, emphasizing the supernatural aspect of the encounter.<p><b>When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them</b><br>Abraham's immediate and eager response to the visitors is indicative of his character and his respect for the cultural practice of hospitality. Running to meet guests was a sign of honor and urgency, especially for a man of Abraham's age and status. This action reflects his willingness to serve and his recognition of the importance of these visitors. The tent, a common dwelling for nomadic people like Abraham, symbolizes his transient lifestyle and reliance on God's promises for a permanent home.<p><b>and bowed low to the ground.</b><br>Bowing low was a customary gesture of respect and submission in the ancient world. Abraham's act of bowing indicates his recognition of the visitors' significance, even before their divine nature is fully revealed. This gesture can also be seen as an act of worship, acknowledging the presence of the divine. In the broader biblical narrative, bowing is often associated with reverence and humility before God (e.g., <a href="/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>, <a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>).

More correctly one was "the angel of Jehovah," who came as the manifestation of Deity to Abraham, and the other two were his companions, commissioned by him afterwards to execute judgment on the cities of the plain, The number three pointed also to the Trinity of Persons in the Godhead, and is therefore read by our Church as one of the lessons for Trinity Sunday. But we must be careful not to use it as a proof of this doctrine, lest the inference should be drawn of a personal appearance of the Father and of the Holy Ghost, which would savour of heretical impiety.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him.</span> Not in addition to (Kalisch), but including (Keil), Jehovah, whose appearance to the patriarch, having in the previous verse been first generally stated, is now minutely described. That these three men were not manifestations of the three persons of the Godhead (Justin Martyr, Ambrose, Cyril), but Jehovah accompanied by two created angels (Keil, <span class="accented">et alii</span>, may be inferred from <a href="/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>. When first perceived by the patriarch they were believed to be men, strangers, who were approaching his tent, and indeed were already close to it, or standing by him. <span class="cmt_word">And when he saw them</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> understood that one of them was Jehovah, Jarchi rightly explaining that the word translated above "looked," i.e. with the bodily vision now implies an act of mental perception), <span class="cmt_word">he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground</span>. The expression denotes the complete prostration of the body by first falling on the knees, and then inclining the head forwards till it touches the ground. As this was a mode of salutation practiced by Orientals towards superiors generally, such as kings and princes (<a href="/2_samuel/9-8.htm">2 Samuel 9:8</a>), but also towards equals (<a href="/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>; <a href="/genesis/33-6.htm">Genesis 33:6, 7</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-26.htm">Genesis 43:26</a>), as well as towards the Deity (<a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), it is impossible to affirm with certainty (Keil, Lunge) that an act of worship was intended by the patriarch, and not simply the presentation of human and civil honor (Calvin). If <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> inclines to countenance the latter interpretation, the language in which Abraham immediately addresses one of the three men almost leads to the conclusion that already the patriarch had recognized Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/18-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Abraham] lifted up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
