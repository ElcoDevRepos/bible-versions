In ancient Near Eastern cultures, serpents often symbolized chaos, danger, or wisdom. The text implies that the serpent's craftiness surpasses that of other animals, indicating a unique role in the narrative. The serpent's presence in the garden, a place of divine order, introduces a potential for disruption. The phrase "that the LORD God had made" emphasizes God's sovereignty over creation, including the serpent, which later Christian theology identifies with Satan (<a href="/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>). This connection suggests a deeper spiritual conflict beyond the immediate narrative.<p><b>And he said to the woman,</b><br>The serpent's direct address to the woman, Eve, highlights her role in the forthcoming events. In the cultural context, women were often seen as more susceptible to deception, a view that has influenced interpretations of this passage. However, the narrative does not explicitly support this stereotype; instead, it presents Eve as an active participant in the dialogue. The serpent's approach to Eve rather than Adam may suggest a strategic choice, as Eve was not the direct recipient of God's command (<a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>), potentially making her more vulnerable to misinterpretation.<p><b>&#8220;Did God really say,</b><br>The serpent's question introduces doubt and challenges the clarity and authority of God's command. This tactic of questioning divine instruction is a common theme in biblical narratives, where faith and obedience are tested. The phrasing implies skepticism and invites Eve to reconsider what she understands about God's will. This moment foreshadows later biblical instances where God's word is questioned or distorted, such as in the temptations of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>&#8216;You must not eat from any tree in the garden?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The serpent's distortion of God's command (<a href="/genesis/2-16.htm">Genesis 2:16-17</a>) exaggerates the prohibition, suggesting an unreasonable restriction. This misrepresentation aims to provoke a response from Eve, leading her to clarify and potentially question the fairness of God's command. The focus on "any tree" contrasts with the actual command, which permitted eating from all trees except one. This tactic of exaggeration is a common method of sowing doubt and confusion, seen in other biblical narratives where truth is twisted to deceive (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). The garden, a place of abundance and provision, becomes the setting for this pivotal moment of choice and temptation, reflecting the broader biblical theme of testing and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_serpent.htm">The Serpent</a></b><br>Described as "more crafty than any beast of the field," the serpent is a key figure in the temptation of Eve. The Hebrew word for "crafty" is (arum), which implies shrewdness or cunning.

Knowing that the tempter is crafty but created, we cling to the unchanging, life-giving Word that he tries to undermine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">III.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Now the serpent.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">And. </span>The Hebrew language, however, is very poor in particles, and the intended contrast would be made plainer by rendering "Now they were both naked (<span class= "ital">arumim</span>) . . . but the serpent was subtil (<span class= "ital">arum</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>more than every beast of the field." This quality of the serpent was in itself innocent, and even admirable, and accordingly the LXX. translate <span class= "ital">prudent; </span>but it was made use of by the tempter to deceive Eve; for, it has been remarked, she would not be surprised on finding herself spoken to by so sagacious a creature. If this be so, it follows that Eve must have dwelt in Paradise long enough to have learnt something of the habits of the animals around her, though she had never studied them so earnestly as Adam, not having felt that want of a companion which had made even his state of happiness so dull.<p><span class= "bld">And he said unto the woman.</span>--The leading point of the narrative is that the temptation came upon man from without, and through the woman. Such questions, therefore, as whether it were a real serpent or Satan under a serpent-like form, whether it spake with a real voice, and whether the narrative describes a literal occurrence or is allegorical, are better left unanswered. God has given us the account of man's temptation and fall, and the entry of sin into the world, in this actual form; and the more reverent course is to draw from the narrative the lessons it was evidently intended to teach us, and not enter upon too curious speculations. We are dealing with records of a vast and hoar antiquity, given to man when he was in a state of great simplicity, and with his intellect only partly developed, and we cannot expect to find them as easy to understand as the pages of modern history.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, hath God said . . .</span>?--There is a tone of surprise in these words, as if the tempter could not bring himself to believe that such a command had been given. Can it really be true, he asks, that Elohim has subjected you to such a prohibition? How unworthy and wrong of Him! Neither the serpent nor the woman use the title--common throughout this section--of Jehovah-Elohim, a sure sign that there was a thoughtful purpose in giving this appellation to the Deity. It is the impersonal God of creation to whom the tempter refers, and the woman follows his guidance, forgetting that it was Jehovah, the loving personal Being in covenant with them, who had really given them the command.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - How long the paradisiacal state of innocence and felicity continued the historian does not declare, probably as not falling within the scope of his immediate design. <a href="/psalms/49-12.htm">Psalm 49:12</a> has been thought, though without sufficient reason, to hint that man's Eden life was of comparatively short duration. The present chapter relates the tragic incident which brought it to a termination. Into the question of the origin of moral evil in the universe it does not enter. The metaphysical problem of how the first thought of sin could arise in innocent beings it does not attempt to resolve. It seeks to explain the genesis of evil with reference to man. Nor even with regard to this does it aim at an exhaustive dissertation, but only at such a statement of its beginnings as shall demonstrate that God is not the author of sin, but that man, by his own free volition, brought his pristine state of purity and happiness to an end. A due regard to this, the specific object of the Mosaic narrative, will go far to answer not a few of the objections which have been taken to its historic credibility. Like the Mosaic record of creation, the Biblical story of the fall has been impugned on a variety of grounds. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The <span class="accented">doctrine</span> of a fall, which this chapter clearly teaches, has been assailed as inconsistent with the dictates of a speculative philosophy, if not also with the tenets of a Scriptural theology. While in the present narrative the origin of sin is distinctly traced back to the free volition of man acting without constraint, though not without temptation, in opposition to the Divine will, a more exact psychological analysis, it is alleged, declares it to have been from the first a necessity, either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">metaphysically</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being involved in the very conception of a finite will (Spinoza, Leibnitz, Baur); or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">historically</span>, "<span class="accented">as</span> the expression of the necessary transition of the human race from the state of nature to that of culture" (Fichte, Kant, Schiller), or as developing itself in obedience to the law of antagonism and conflict (John Seotus Erigena, Hegel, Sehleiermacher, Schelling);
