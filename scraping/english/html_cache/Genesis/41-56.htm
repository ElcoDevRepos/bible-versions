This aligns with the dream interpretation Joseph provided to Pharaoh, predicting seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine (<a href="/genesis/41-29.htm">Genesis 41:29-30</a>). The famine's reach emphasizes the fulfillment of God's revelation through Joseph, showcasing divine sovereignty over natural events. Historically, famines were common in the ancient Near East due to reliance on agriculture and the Nile's flooding patterns. This event sets the stage for the movement of Jacob's family to Egypt, a pivotal moment in Israel's history.<p><b>Joseph opened up all the storehouses</b><br>Joseph's actions demonstrate his wisdom and administrative skills, as he had prepared for the famine during the seven years of plenty by storing surplus grain (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>). This preparation reflects God's providence and Joseph's faithfulness in executing his duties. The storehouses symbolize God's provision and the importance of stewardship. Joseph's role as a savior figure foreshadows Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance to a world in need.<p><b>and sold grain to the Egyptians</b><br>Joseph's decision to sell grain rather than give it away highlights the economic strategies employed to manage resources and maintain order during the crisis. This approach ensured the sustainability of supplies and the functioning of the Egyptian economy. It also reflects the principle of work and reward, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>. Joseph's actions preserved the nation and reinforced his position of authority, prefiguring Christ's role as a provider and sustainer.<p><b>for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt</b><br>The severity of the famine underscores the dire circumstances and the necessity of Joseph's leadership. It highlights the vulnerability of human societies to natural disasters and the need for divine intervention. The famine's impact on Egypt, a powerful and resource-rich nation, illustrates that no earthly power is immune to God's plans. This situation sets the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and deliverance, a key theme in the biblical narrative of redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

Now those massive silos are unlocked.<p>&#8226; Wise stewardship prepares in advance for foreseeable trouble (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>; 21:20). Joseph models practical faith&#8212;trusting God while acting responsibly.<p>&#8226; His obedience turns a national catastrophe into an opportunity for blessing, mirroring the principle that &#8220;it is required of stewards that one be found faithful&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sold grain to the Egyptians</b><p>&#8226; Rather than giving the grain away indiscriminately, Joseph sells it.

By purchasing, the people participate in their own relief, a pattern echoed later when Paul urges believers to &#8220;work quietly and eat their own bread&#8221; (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Scripture repeats the word &#8220;severe&#8221; to stress the extremity of the need (<a href="/genesis/43-1.htm">Genesis 43:1</a>). God&#8217;s word had warned, and now the hardship is fully felt.<p>&#8226; Such severity magnifies God&#8217;s mercy: through one obedient servant an entire nation&#8212;and eventually the family of Israel&#8212;is preserved (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a> reminds us, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.&#8221; The famine&#8217;s intensity highlights the deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a> shows the literal fulfillment of God&#8217;s revelation to Joseph, the effectiveness of obedient preparation, and the gracious provision of the Lord amid severe judgment.

"In the tomb of Amenemha at Beni-hassan there is the painting of a great storehouse, before whose door lies a great heap of grain already winnowed.

Egypt); but, this, according to Bunsen ('Egypt's Place, 3:334), is rather to be detected in a dearth of several years which occurred in the time of Osirtasen I., and which is mentioned in an inscription at Beni-hassan, recording the fact that during its prevalence food was supplied by Amenee, the governor of a district of Upper Egypt (Smith's' Dict.,' art. Joseph). The character of Chnumhotep (a near relative and favorite of Osirtasen I., and his immediate successor), and the recorded events of his government, as described in the Beni-hassan monuments, also remind one of Joseph: - "he (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Chnumhotep) injured no little child; he oppressed no widow; he detained for his own purpose no fisherman; took from his work no shepherd; no overseer's men were taken. There was no beggar in his days; no one starved in his time. When years of famine occurred he ploughed all the lands of the district, producing abundant food; no one starved in it; he treated the widow as a woman with a husband to protect her" (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 1. p. 450). <span class="cmt_word">And all countries</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> people from all the adjoining lands) <span class="cmt_word">came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
