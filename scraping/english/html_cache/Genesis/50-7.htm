This act of honoring his father's wishes demonstrates Joseph's deep respect and adherence to family traditions and promises. It also highlights the importance of burial practices in ancient times, where being laid to rest in one's ancestral land was a significant cultural and religious act.<p><b>and all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him</b><br>The presence of Pharaoh's servants indicates the high regard in which Joseph was held in Egypt. As the second most powerful man in the nation, Joseph's influence extended to the royal court. This accompaniment by Pharaoh's servants underscores the respect and honor given to Joseph and his family, reflecting the strong relationship between Joseph and Pharaoh. It also illustrates the integration of Joseph's Hebrew heritage with his Egyptian status.<p><b>the elders of Pharaoh&#8217;s household</b><br>The elders of Pharaoh's household were likely high-ranking officials and advisors within the Egyptian government. Their participation in the funeral procession signifies the importance of the event and the respect for Joseph's family. This inclusion of Egyptian officials in a Hebrew burial ceremony highlights the blending of cultures and the mutual respect between Joseph and the Egyptian leadership.<p><b>and all the elders of the land of Egypt</b><br>The involvement of all the elders of Egypt further emphasizes the national significance of Jacob's burial. It suggests that Joseph's influence and the mourning for Jacob extended beyond the royal court to the broader Egyptian society. This widespread participation may also reflect the impact of Joseph's leadership during the years of famine, where he played a crucial role in preserving the nation.

A detailed and highly interesting account of the funeral procession of an Egyptian grandee, enabling us to picture to the mind's eye the scene of Jacob s burial, will be found in Wilkinson's 'Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 3. p. 444, ed. 1878. First servants led the way, carrying tables laden with fruit, cakes, flowers, vases of ointment, wine and other liquids, with three young geese and a calf for sacrifice, chairs and wooden tablets, napkins, and other things. Then others followed bearing daggers, bows, fans, and the mummy cases in which the deceased and his ancestors had been kept previous to burial. Next came a table of offerings, fauteuils, couches, boxes, and a chariot. After these men appeared with gold vases and more offerings. To these succeeded the bearers of a sacred boat and the mysterious eye of Osiris, as the god of stability. Placed in the consecrated boat, the hearse containing the mummy of the deceased was drawn by four oxen and by seven men, under the direction of a superintendent who regulated the march of the funeral. Behind the hearse followed the male relations and friends of the deceased, who either beat their breasts, or gave token of their sorrow by their silence and solemn step as they walked, leaning on their long sticks; and with these the procession closed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/50-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1430;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
