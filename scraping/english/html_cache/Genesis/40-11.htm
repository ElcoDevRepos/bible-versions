The cupbearer held a significant position in Pharaoh's court, responsible for serving wine and ensuring it was not poisoned. This role required trust and loyalty, reflecting the cupbearer's close proximity to Pharaoh. The imagery of the cup in his hand symbolizes authority and service, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>, where Nehemiah also serves as a cupbearer to the king.<p><b>and I took the grapes</b><br>The act of taking grapes directly suggests a personal involvement in the preparation of the wine, which was a common practice in ancient Egypt. Grapes were a staple in Egyptian agriculture, and wine was a valued commodity. This detail highlights the cupbearer's direct role in the process, emphasizing his responsibility and the trust placed in him by Pharaoh. The imagery of grapes can also be seen in <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, where Israel is compared to a vineyard, symbolizing God's care and expectation of fruitfulness.<p><b>squeezed them into his cup</b><br>The act of squeezing grapes into the cup signifies the transformation of raw materials into a finished product, akin to the process of refining and purifying. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual transformation and the pressing trials that lead to growth, as reflected in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>. The imagery of wine is also significant in biblical typology, often representing joy, blessing, and covenant, as seen in the New Testament during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-29</a>).<p><b>and placed the cup in his hand.</b><br>Placing the cup in Pharaoh's hand signifies the completion of the cupbearer's duty and the restoration of his position. This act of service is a foreshadowing of Joseph's own rise to power, as he interprets the dream and later becomes second in command in Egypt. The theme of restoration and elevation is prevalent in the Bible, as seen in the story of Daniel, who also interprets dreams and gains favor with the king (<a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46-49</a>). The cupbearer's dream and its fulfillment serve as a precursor to Joseph's own vindication and the unfolding of God's providential plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing authority and power.

He will stand before kings&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>). The dream reminds us that God can move His servants into strategic places&#8212;Joseph in prison, the cupbearer in the palace&#8212;to fulfill His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I took the grapes</b><p>&#8226; Grapes symbolize blessing and abundance throughout the Bible (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-8</a>; <a href="/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>). Here, the cupbearer notes he personally &#8220;took the grapes,&#8221; underscoring initiative and readiness to serve.<p>&#8226; The fruit imagery foreshadows future redemption: Jesus later declares, &#8220;I am the true vine&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>), showing how God brings life through what He provides. In the story, God will &#8220;take&#8221; Joseph from confinement just as surely.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Squeezed them into his cup</b><p>&#8226; The grapes are pressed directly into Pharaoh&#8217;s cup&#8212;fresh, unfermented, immediate. This detail pictures service that is both personal and pure, uncontaminated by delay. <a href="/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a> likewise speaks of &#8220;new wine found in the cluster,&#8221; preserving blessing within the fruit.<p>&#8226; Wine often points to joy and covenant (<a href="/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="/mark/14-24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>). The action hints that Pharaoh&#8217;s joy&#8212;and Egypt&#8217;s welfare&#8212;will soon be restored, even as God is preparing to use Joseph to preserve nations during famine (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Placed the cup in his hand</b><p>&#8226; Final step: the cupbearer returns the cup to Pharaoh&#8217;s own hand. Restoration is complete; fellowship is renewed. Psalms at times depict blessing &#8220;at Your right hand&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>), and here the king&#8217;s right hand again holds the cup.<p>&#8226; This scene anticipates Joseph&#8217;s interpretation: &#8220;Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty over rulers (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>) is quietly on display&#8212;He alone orchestrates both the fall and the rise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every verb in <a href="/genesis/40-11.htm">Genesis 40:11</a> paints a vivid picture of restoration: the trusted servant handling the cup, gathering the fruit, pressing out its goodness, and returning joy to the king. God is showing, through a simple dream, that He holds the future of empires and prisoners alike. The cupbearer will be lifted up, and in God&#8217;s perfect timing Joseph will be lifted even higher, proving once again that &#8220;the word of the LORD is flawless&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/40.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And pressed them.</span>--Plutarch, <span class= "ital">Is. et Osir. </span>? 6, says that before the time of Psammetichus the Egyptians did not drink wine, nor make libations of it to the gods. This statement has been abundantly disproved, and probably arose from the writer supposing that the custom of, possibly, one district was the universal rule. Nevertheless, the king's drink here does not seem to have been fermented wine, but a sort of sherbet made of fresh grape-juice and water. It is a pleasant beverage, still much used in the East, but sometimes the grape juice is left till fermentation has just begun when it acquires a pleasant briskness, and is less cloying.<p><span class= "bld">Into Pharaoh's hand.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">I placed the cup upon Pharaoh's palm. </span>The word is used in <a href="/genesis/32-25.htm" title="And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.">Genesis 32:25</a> of the <span class= "ital">hollow </span>of Jacob's thigh (see Note there). Here it means the hollow produced by bending the fingers inwards. Now the Hebrews always spoke of placing the cup in a person's hand (<a href="/ezekiel/23-31.htm" title="You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.">Ezekiel 23:31</a>, and see <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm" title="For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he pours out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-7.htm" title="Babylon has been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.">Jeremiah 51:7</a>); and even here Joseph, though probably speaking the Egyptian language, nevertheless used the Hebrew idiom, saying, <span class= "ital">thou wilt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand. </span>It is the Egyptian cup-bearer, who, using the idiom of his own country, speaks of placing the cup upon Pharaoh's palm, the reason being that Egyptian cups had no stems, but were flat bowls or saucers, held in the very way which the cup-bearer describes.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/40-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Pharaoh&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(par&#183;&#8216;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6547.htm">Strong's 6547: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pharaoh -- a title of Egypt kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">cup</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;ws)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
