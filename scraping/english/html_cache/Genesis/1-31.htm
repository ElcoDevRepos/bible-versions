It reflects the completion of His creative work, highlighting His omniscience and omnipotence. The act of God looking upon His creation suggests a divine evaluation and approval. This mirrors the pattern seen throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God assesses His work and declares it good. The phrase also connects to <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>, which praises God's wisdom in creation, and to <a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>, affirming that all things were made through Him.<p><b>and indeed, it was very good</b><br>The term "very good" signifies the perfection and harmony of creation before the fall of man. It indicates that everything was functioning according to God's perfect design, without sin or corruption. This phrase underscores the inherent goodness of God's creation, a theme that is echoed in <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, which states that every good and perfect gift is from above. The use of "very" intensifies the goodness, suggesting completeness and fulfillment. This also foreshadows the restoration of creation in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where God will make all things new.<p><b>And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the sixth day</b><br>This phrase marks the conclusion of the sixth day of creation, following the pattern established in the previous days. The mention of evening and morning indicates a literal 24-hour day, a view held by many conservative theologians. The structure of the days in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> emphasizes order and purpose in God's creation. The sixth day is significant as it includes the creation of humanity, made in God's image, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>. This sets the stage for the seventh day, a day of rest, which prefigures the Sabbath and points to the ultimate rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who evaluates His creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The entirety of what God made, including the heavens, the earth, and all living creatures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sixth_day.htm">The Sixth Day</a></b><br>The final day of creation when God completed His work and declared it "very good."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_goodness_of_creation.htm">The Goodness of Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that everything God created was inherently good, reflecting His perfect nature.
