The deep sleep signifies a state of unconsciousness, suggesting that Adam was entirely passive during this event. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses sleep to perform significant acts, such as with Abram in <a href="/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and the idea that humanity is dependent on God for life and creation.<p><b>and while he slept</b><br>The state of sleep here is not just physical rest but a divine anesthesia, allowing God to perform a creative act without Adam's awareness or participation. This can be seen as a precursor to the concept of rest in the Sabbath, where God completes His work and humanity benefits from it. It also foreshadows the idea of spiritual rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<p><b>He took one of the man&#8217;s ribs</b><br>The choice of a rib is significant, symbolizing equality and partnership. The rib, being from the side, suggests that woman is neither above nor below man but alongside him. This act of taking a rib can be seen as a type of Christ, who was pierced in His side on the cross (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>), symbolizing the birth of the Church, His bride. The rib's removal and subsequent creation of woman highlight the intimate and purposeful design of human relationships.<p><b>and closed up the area with flesh</b><br>This phrase indicates God's meticulous care in creation, ensuring that Adam was made whole again. It reflects the completeness and perfection of God's work, as seen throughout the creation narrative. The closing up with flesh also signifies healing and restoration, themes prevalent in the redemptive work of Christ, who heals and restores humanity through His sacrifice. This act of closing up can be seen as a precursor to the resurrection, where what is broken or incomplete is made whole.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is actively involved in the formation of humanity and the establishment of relationships.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man (Adam)</a></b><br>The first human, created by God, who is put into a deep sleep for the creation of woman.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deep_sleep.htm">The Deep Sleep</a></b><br>A divinely induced state that allows God to perform the first surgery, symbolizing trust and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rib.htm">The Rib</a></b><br>The part of Adam used by God to create Eve, symbolizing equality and partnership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_creation_of_woman.htm">The Creation of Woman</a></b><br>The event where God forms Eve from Adam's rib, establishing the foundation for human relationships and marriage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_design_and_purpose.htm">Divine Design and Purpose</a></b><br>God&#8217;s intentional design in creating woman from man highlights the purpose and value of both genders in His creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God&#8217;s Plan</a></b><br>Adam&#8217;s deep sleep signifies trust in God&#8217;s plan and timing.

Lightfoot, following the LXX. who translate <span class="accented">tardemah</span> (deep sleep) by <span class="accented">ecstasy</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, imagines that the whole scene of Eve's creation was presented to Adam's imagination in a Divinely-inspired dream, which has at least the countenance of <a href="/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a> Such a supposition, however, is not required to account for Adam's recognition of his bride. There is more of aptness in the observation of Lange, that in the deep sleep of Adam we have an echo of the area-tire evenings that preceded the Divine activity. "Everything out of which some new thing is to come sinks down before the event into such a deep sleep, is the farseeing and comprehensive remark of Ziegler. <span class="cmt_word">And he took one of his ribs</span> (<span class="accented">tsela</span> = something bent, from <span class="accented">tesala</span>, to incline; hence a rib), <span class="cmt_word">and closed up the flesh</span> (literally, flesh) <span class="cmt_word">instead thereof</span>. Whether Adam was created with a superfluous rib, or his body was mutilated by the abstraction of a rib, is a question for the curious. In the first, Calvin finds nothing "which is not in accordance with Divine providence," while he favors the latter conjecture, and thinks that Adam got a rich compensation - "quum se integrum vidit in uxore, qui prius tantum dimidius erat." Luther inclines to think that Adam's language in ver. 23 implies that not the bare rib, but the rib with the accompanying flesh, was extracted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1501;
