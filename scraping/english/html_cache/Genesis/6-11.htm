This corruption is not merely a human perspective but is seen from God's viewpoint, emphasizing divine judgment. The Hebrew word for "corrupt" suggests a state of ruin or destruction, indicating that humanity's actions had defiled the earth. This corruption is reminiscent of the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where sin first entered the world, and it sets the stage for the need for divine intervention. The corruption of the earth can be seen as a precursor to the judgment of the flood, highlighting the seriousness of sin and its consequences. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Christ, who restores what was corrupted by sin.<p><b>and full of violence</b><br>The mention of "violence" underscores the extent of humanity's moral decline. The Hebrew word used here implies physical violence, oppression, and injustice, suggesting a society where might makes right and the weak are oppressed. This violence is a direct violation of God's command for humans to love one another and live in peace. The prevalence of violence is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to divine judgment, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. This phrase connects to the prophecy of the end times in <a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37</a>, where Jesus compares the days of Noah to the days before His return, indicating a similar state of moral decay and violence. The violence of Noah's time contrasts with the peace and justice that Christ will establish in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who observes the state of the earth and its inhabitants.
