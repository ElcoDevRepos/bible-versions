The use of "evening" and "morning" suggests a literal 24-hour day, a view held by many conservative scholars. This pattern of evening followed by morning is consistent throughout the creation narrative, underscoring the order and structure God brings to creation. The concept of evening and morning also reflects the Jewish understanding of a day, which begins at sunset, aligning with the Hebrew calendar and cultural practices.<p><b>the fourth day.</b><br>On the fourth day, God created the celestial bodies: the sun, moon, and stars. This day is significant as it establishes the means by which time is measured&#8212;days, seasons, and years. The creation of these lights serves not only practical purposes but also theological ones, as they are set to govern the day and night, reflecting God's sovereignty over time and creation. The fourth day can be connected to <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which speaks of the heavens declaring the glory of God, and to <a href="/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>, where the New Jerusalem has no need for the sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates it.

The Scripture references to this day's work are both numerous and instructive (cf. <a href="/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; 37:31; <a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>; <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>; <a href="/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>; <a href="/psalms/147.htm">Psalm 147</a>.). The Hebrew writers supply no information as to the astronomical theories which were prevalent in their time; yet "from other sources we have facts leading to the belief that even in the time of Moses there was not a little practical astronomy in the East, and some good theory. The Chaldeans at a very early period had ascertained the principal circles of the sphere, the position of the poles, and the nature of the apparent motions of the heavens as the results of revolution on an inclined axis. The Egyptian astronomers, whom we know through Thales, , taught the true nature of the moon's light, the sphericity of the earth, and the position of its five zones. Pythagoras, , knew, in addition, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the identity of the evening and morning star, and the earth's revolution round the sun" (Dawson, 'O.W.,' p. 207). Modern astronomy, though possessed of highly probable theories as to the formation of the universe, is still unable to speak with absolute precision with regard to this fourth day's work. Yet them are not wanting indirect corroborations of the truth of the Mosaic narrative from both it and geology. According to the sacred writer, the presently existing atmosphere, the distribution of land and water, the succession of day and night, and the regular alternation of the seasons, were established prior to the introduction of animal life upon the earth; and Sir Charles Lyell has demonstrated nothing more successfully than the dominion of "<span class="accented">existing</span> causes" from the Eozoic era downwards, and the sufficiency of these causes to account for all the changes which have taken place in the earth's crust. Again, geology attests the prevalence on our globe in prehistoric times of a much more uniform and high temperature than it now possesses, so late as the Miocene era a genial tropical climate having extended up beyond the Arctic circle, and in the earliest eras of the history of the globe, in all probability, the entire sphere bring so favored with excessive heat. Different causes have been suggested for this phenomenon; as, e.g., the greater heat of the cooling globe (the earliest geologists), a different distribution of land and water (Lyell), variations in the eccentricity of the earth's orbit (Herschell and. Croll), changes in the earth's axis (Evans, Drayson, Bell), and the greater intensity of the sun's heat; Sir W Thomson, 'Trans. Geolog. Soc.,' Glasgow, 1877). The Biblical narrative, by distinctly teaching that the sun was perfected on the fourth day, renders it intelligible that his influence on the surface of the earth was then at its greatest, causing tropical climates to prevail and tropical vegetation to abound, both of which have gradually disappeared from the polar regions in consequence of the sun's diminished heat.
