Her ability to bear children was a source of pride and a means to secure her position in the family. The cessation of her childbearing could have been seen as a divine intervention or a natural pause, reflecting the ebb and flow of fertility common in biblical narratives. This moment of barrenness echoes the experiences of other matriarchs like Sarah and Rachel, highlighting the theme of God's sovereignty over the womb.<p><b>she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife</b><br>In the cultural context of the time, it was customary for a wife who could not bear children to offer her maidservant to her husband as a surrogate. This practice is seen earlier with Sarah and Hagar. Leah's decision to give Zilpah to Jacob reflects the intense rivalry with her sister Rachel, who had already given her maidservant Bilhah to Jacob. The term "wife" here indicates a secondary status, as Zilpah would not have the same rights as Leah or Rachel. This act underscores the complexities of family dynamics and the lengths to which individuals would go to secure their legacy and fulfill societal expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, who initially bore him several sons.

Earlier the LORD had &#8220;opened her womb&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>), allowing her to bear four sons&#8212;Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s attention is fixed on the family dynamic: Rachel, once barren, is now using her maid Bilhah to gain sons through Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3-8</a>). Leah sees the competitive atmosphere and recognizes her own dwindling advantage.<p>&#8226; Like Hannah who &#8220;saw&#8221; her barrenness in contrast to Peninnah&#8217;s fertility (<a href="/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6-7</a>), Leah&#8217;s observation is steeped in the emotional weight that childbearing carried in her culture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that she had stopped having children</b><p>&#8226; The text states plainly that Leah had &#8220;stopped.&#8221; God, who earlier &#8220;opened her womb,&#8221; has now allowed a pause. Scripture often shows the LORD sovereign over the womb (<a href="/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; For Leah, sons were her hope for affection from Jacob (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>). The cessation feels like a setback in her longing for her husband&#8217;s love and status in the household.<p>&#8226; Human disappointment appears, yet God is still orchestrating His covenant plan; Leah will eventually bear two more sons and a daughter (<a href="/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17-21</a>), underscoring that this &#8220;stop&#8221; is temporary, not final.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she gave her servant Zilpah to Jacob as a wife</b><p>&#8226; Following the precedent Sarah set with Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2-3</a>) and Rachel with Bilhah (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3-4</a>), Leah resorts to the culturally accepted&#8212;though spiritually flawed&#8212;practice of surrogate motherhood.<p>&#8226; Zilpah becomes a secondary wife, and the children born (Gad and Asher, <a href="/genesis/30-10.htm">Genesis 30:10-13</a>) are legally considered Leah&#8217;s.

The move mirrors earlier surrogate arrangements and reflects a human attempt to secure favor and standing.

The struggle of these two women for the husband gives us a strange picture of manners and morals, but must not be judged by our standard. Leah herself regards the bestowal of her handmaid upon Jacob as a deserving act of self-sacrifice (<a href="/genesis/30-18.htm" title="And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.">Genesis 30:18</a>). The names, moreover, which she gives to Zilpah's children show that the happier frame of mind to which she had attained when she called her fourth son "Judah," <span class= "ital">praise, </span>remained unbroken.
