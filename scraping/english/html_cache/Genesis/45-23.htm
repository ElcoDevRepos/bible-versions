This act signifies the restoration of family ties and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham's descendants. It reflects the importance of honoring one's parents, a principle deeply rooted in the cultural and religious traditions of the time.<p><b>ten donkeys loaded with the best of Egypt,</b><br>The use of donkeys as pack animals highlights the practical means of transport in ancient times. The "best of Egypt" indicates the wealth and abundance of the land, which was known for its prosperity and advanced civilization. This phrase underscores the contrast between the famine-stricken Canaan and the fertile land of Egypt, where Joseph had stored up resources. It also symbolizes the blessings that come from God's providence.<p><b>and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provisions</b><br>The specific mention of female donkeys may imply their value for breeding and sustaining future wealth. Grain and bread were staples of the ancient diet, essential for survival, especially during a famine. The provisions represent not only physical sustenance but also the care and foresight of Joseph, who ensures his family's needs are met. This act of provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for the spiritual and physical needs of His people.<p><b>for his father&#8217;s journey.</b><br>Jacob's journey to Egypt is significant as it marks the movement of the Israelites into a foreign land, setting the stage for future events in biblical history, including the Exodus. This journey is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a land not their own. It also foreshadows the journey of faith that believers undertake, trusting in God's guidance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
