Isaac, who is old and has poor eyesight, is deceived by Jacob, who is impersonating his brother Esau. This moment is pivotal in the story of Jacob and Esau, as it fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The act of deception also foreshadows future events in Jacob's life, where he himself will be deceived by Laban. This phrase underscores the human tendency to rely on physical senses, which can be misleading, rather than spiritual discernment.<p><b>because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau</b><br>The description of Esau as hairy is consistent with earlier accounts in Genesis, where Esau is described as red and hairy at birth (<a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>). This physical characteristic becomes a key element in Jacob's deception. The use of goat skins to mimic Esau's hairy hands is a clever ruse that exploits Isaac's reliance on touch due to his failing eyesight. This detail also reflects the cultural importance of physical traits in identifying individuals, as well as the lengths to which Jacob and Rebekah are willing to go to secure the blessing. The use of animal skins can be seen as a type of the sacrificial system, where coverings are used to present oneself as something they are not.<p><b>so he blessed him</b><br>The blessing Isaac gives to Jacob, thinking he is Esau, is significant in the biblical narrative. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a father's blessing was a powerful and binding declaration that often included the transfer of leadership, inheritance, and divine favor. This blessing, intended for Esau, includes promises of prosperity, dominion, and the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant. The act of blessing Jacob instead of Esau fulfills God's earlier prophecy and sets the stage for the unfolding of Israel's history. This moment also prefigures the concept of grace, where blessings are given not based on merit but on God's sovereign choice, paralleling the New Testament theme of believers receiving blessings through Christ, the true firstborn.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>- The patriarch of the family, Isaac is the son of Abraham and Sarah.

His physical blindness set the stage, but the narrative also hints at a spiritual dullness; Isaac favored Esau despite the earlier prophecy that &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob approaches with a false identity. Isaac, suspicious, asks, &#8220;Who are you, my son?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-18.htm">Genesis 27:18</a>). Voice and words raise doubts (<a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a>), yet Isaac trusts what he can touch more than what he can hear.<p>&#8226; Scripture often warns about judging by outward appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>).

Isaac comments, &#8220;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a>). He chooses the sense that confirms his preference, not the one that aligns with truth.<p>&#8226; This moment echoes earlier deceptions rooted in appetite and appearance&#8212;Esau&#8217;s sale of his birthright for stew (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>) and now Isaac&#8217;s hunger for wild game (<a href="/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>).
