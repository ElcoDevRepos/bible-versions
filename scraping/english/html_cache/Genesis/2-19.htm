This mirrors the creation of man in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God also forms Adam from the dust of the ground, indicating a shared origin and connection between humans and animals. The phrase underscores God's sovereignty as the Creator and His intimate involvement in the formation of life. The mention of "beast of the field" and "bird of the air" suggests a comprehensive creation of terrestrial and avian life, reflecting the diversity and order within creation. This act of forming animals from the ground can be seen as a precursor to the new creation in Christ, where believers are made new (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<p><b>and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the unique role and authority given to man over creation. By bringing the animals to Adam, God is inviting him to participate in the creative process, demonstrating the relational aspect between God and humanity. Naming in the ancient Near Eastern context signifies authority and understanding, as seen in other biblical instances where names are given to express identity and purpose (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>, where Abram is renamed Abraham). This act of naming also reflects Adam's wisdom and discernment, gifts bestowed by God. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who names and calls His own (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>).<p><b>And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the authority and responsibility entrusted to Adam. The act of naming signifies dominion, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given the mandate to rule over the earth. It also reflects the order and structure within creation, as each creature is given a specific identity and role. The permanence of the names given by Adam suggests the enduring nature of God's creation and the established order. This can be connected to the prophetic role of Christ, who has the ultimate authority to name and define His creation (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>).

Much curious speculation has arisen from the mistaken idea that the order here is chronological, and that the animals were created subsequently to man, and that it was only upon their failing one and all to supply Adam's need of a companion that woman was called into being. The real point of the narrative is the insight it gives us into Adam's intellectual condition, his study of the animal creation, and the nature of the employment in which he spent his time. Then finally, at the end of <a href="/genesis/2-20.htm" title="And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.">Genesis 2:20</a>, after numerous animals had passed before him, comes the assertion, with cumulative force, that woman alone is a meet companion for man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air.</span> To allege that the Creator's purpose to provide a helpmeet for Adam seeks realization through the production of the animals (Kalisch, Alford) proceeds upon a misapprehension of the proper nexus which binds the thoughts of the historian, and a want of attention to the peculiar structure of Hebrew composition, besides exhibiting Jehovah Elohim in the character of an empiric who only tentatively discovers the sort of partner that is suitable for man. It is not the time, but simply the fact, of the creation of the animals that the historian records. The <span class="accented">Vav</span>. consec. does not necessarily involve time-succession, but is frequently employed to indicate thought-sequence (cf. 2:8; <a href="/1_kings/2-13.htm">1 Kings 2:13</a>, etc.). The verb (pret.) may also quite legitimately be rendered "had formed (Bush). "Our modern style of expressing the Semitic writer's thought would be this - 'And God brought to Adam the beasts which he had formed (Delitzsch). It is thus unnecessary to defend the record from a charge of inconsistency with the previous section, by supposing this to be the account of a second creation of animals in the district of Eden. Another so-called contradiction, that the present narrative takes no account of the creation of aquatic animals, is disposed of by observing that the writer only notices that those animals which were brought to Adam had been previously formed by God from the ground, and were thus in the line of the onward evolutions of the heavens and the earth which led up to mare As to why the fishes were not brought into the garden, if other reason is required besides that of physical impossibility, the ingenuity of Keil suggests that these were not so nearly related to Adam as the fowls and the beasts, which, besides, were the animals specially ordained for his service. <span class="cmt_word">And brought them</span> (literally, brought; not necessarily all the animals in Eden, but specimens of them) unto <span class="cmt_word">Adam</span>. We agree with Willet in believing that "neither did Adam gather together the cattle as a shepherd doth his sheep, nor did the angels muster them, nor the animals come themselves, and, passing by, while he sat on some elevation, bow their heads at his resplendent appearance; nor were Adam's eyes so illuminate that he beheld them all in their places - all which," says he, "are but men's conceits; but that through the secret influence of God upon their natures they were assembled round the inmate of paradise, as afterwards they were collected in the ark. The reasons for this particular action on the part of God were manifold; one of them being stated in the words which follow - <span class="cmt_word">to see what he would call them</span>; literally, to them. Already man had received from God his first lesson in the exercise of speech, in the naming of the trees and the imposition of the prohibition. This was his second - the opportunity afforded him of using for himself that gift of language and reason with which he had been endowed. In this it is implied that man was created with the faculty of speech, the distinct gift of articulate and rational utterance, and the capacity of attaching words to ideas, though it also seems to infer that the evolution of a language was for him, as it is for the individual yet, a matter of gradual development. Another reason was to manifest his sovereignty or lordship over the inferior creation. <span class="cmt_word">And whatsoever Adam</span> (literally, the man) <span class="cmt_word">called every living creature</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> that was brought to him), <span class="cmt_word">that was the name thereof.</span> That is to say, it not only met the Divine approbation as exactly suitable to the nature of the creature, and thus was a striking attestation of the intelligence and wisdom of the first man, but it likewise adhered to the creature as a name which had been assigned by its master. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And out of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the ground</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
