This is significant given their past conflict over the birthright and blessing. Jacob's use of "servant" indicates a desire for reconciliation and peace. The cultural context of the time placed great importance on family hierarchy and respect, and Jacob's language shows his willingness to submit to Esau's authority, despite having received the blessing of the firstborn from Isaac.<p><b>I will continue on slowly,</b><br>Jacob's intention to proceed slowly is practical, considering the large number of livestock and young children in his care. This reflects his responsibility as a patriarch to ensure the safety and well-being of his family and possessions. The phrase also suggests a strategic decision, allowing Jacob to maintain a safe distance from Esau until he is certain of his brother's intentions. This cautious approach is consistent with Jacob's character, as seen in previous chapters where he often acts with prudence and foresight.<p><b>at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children,</b><br>The mention of livestock and children highlights the logistical challenges of moving a large family and their possessions. In the ancient Near East, travel was arduous, and the pace had to accommodate the weakest members of the group. This phrase underscores Jacob's role as a caretaker and protector, ensuring that no harm comes to his family. It also reflects the pastoral lifestyle of the patriarchs, who were often on the move with their herds.<p><b>until I come to my lord at Seir.&#8221;</b><br>Seir is the region associated with Esau and the Edomites, located south of the Dead Sea. Jacob's statement about coming to Seir suggests an intention to visit Esau, though the biblical narrative does not record such a visit. This could imply a diplomatic gesture or a promise of future reconciliation. Theologically, Seir represents Esau's domain, contrasting with the Promised Land given to Jacob's descendants. This phrase may also foreshadow the ongoing tension between Israel (descendants of Jacob) and Edom (descendants of Esau) throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to Canaan after years in Haran.
