The mention of Lotan's sons, Hori and Hemam, provides insight into the genealogical records of the Horites, who were integrated into the Edomite lineage. The name "Hori" is likely related to the Horites themselves, suggesting a connection to the mountainous region they inhabited. "Hemam" is less clear in meaning but contributes to the understanding of the familial structures in ancient Edom. This genealogy underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations, as the Edomites are descendants of Esau, Abraham's grandson.<p><b>Timna was Lotan&#8217;s sister.</b><br>Timna's mention as Lotan's sister highlights the importance of women in genealogical records, which is less common in ancient texts. Timna is also noted elsewhere as a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau's son, and the mother of Amalek, a significant figure in Israel's history. This connection to Amalek ties Timna to the ongoing narrative of conflict between Israel and the Amalekites, as seen in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.

Lotan is introduced as the firstborn of Seir the Horite (<a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a>), and verse 22 tells us, &#8220;The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is a straightforward statement of lineage, confirming two literal sons. Compare <a href="/1_chronicles/1-38.htm">1 Chronicles 1:38</a>, which repeats the same names, underscoring accuracy.<p>&#8226; The Horites were the original inhabitants of the hill country of Seir (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>), and Scripture affirms that Esau&#8217;s descendants intermarried with them, gradually absorbing their territory (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Recording the sons&#8217; names matters because these men became clan heads (<a href="/genesis/36-29.htm">Genesis 36:29</a>). The line of promise comes through Jacob, yet God still preserves the record of Esau&#8217;s relatives, demonstrating His comprehensive sovereignty over all nations (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Timna was Lotan&#8217;s sister</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;Timna was Lotan&#8217;s sister.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Naming a sister in a genealogical list is unusual and signals her later importance. <a href="/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a> explains why: &#8220;Timna was a concubine of Esau&#8217;s son Eliphaz, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By noting Timna here, Moses prepares us for the birth of Amalek, ancestor of the Amalekites&#8212;persistent foes of Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The insertion underlines that choices made inside one family line (Esau&#8217;s) will ripple across Israel&#8217;s history. Even centuries later, God reminds Saul that the Amalekites&#8217; enmity began in these earliest family ties (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail also shows that God&#8217;s Word does not overlook women&#8217;s roles. Though patriarchal lists center on sons, the Spirit ensures Timna&#8217;s name is preserved because her offspring will shape redemptive history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/36-22.htm">Genesis 36:22</a> may appear to be a routine family note, yet it roots Israel&#8217;s story in real people and places. By recording Hori and Hemam, Scripture confirms the rise of Horite clans that merged with Esau&#8217;s line. By spotlighting Timna, it foreshadows the emergence of the Amalekites.
