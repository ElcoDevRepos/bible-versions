This name is significant because both Abraham and Sarah laughed at the promise of having a son in their old age (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; 18:12). Isaac's name serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises, despite human doubt. The act of naming by Abraham signifies his acceptance and acknowledgment of God's promise. Naming in biblical times was a significant act, often reflecting character or destiny.<p><b>to the son Sarah bore to him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of God's specific promise to Abraham and Sarah, not just to Abraham alone. Sarah's role is crucial, as she was initially barren, and her bearing a son is a testament to God's miraculous intervention. This event is a pivotal moment in the Abrahamic covenant, as Isaac is the child through whom God's promises to Abraham would be realized (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). The birth of Isaac also prefigures the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ, born to Mary, who was a virgin, highlighting the theme of divine intervention in human history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.
