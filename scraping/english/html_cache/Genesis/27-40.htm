Historically, Esau's descendants, the Edomites, were often in conflict with neighboring nations, including Israel. The sword symbolizes warfare and survival through strength and aggression. This prophecy reflects the turbulent history of the Edomites, who were known for their warrior culture and frequent battles with Israel (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>). The imagery of the sword also connects to the broader biblical theme of conflict between nations and peoples, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>, where Jesus speaks of those who live by the sword.<p><b>and serve your brother.</b><br>This part of the prophecy highlights the subjugation of Esau's descendants to Jacob's lineage, the Israelites. Historically, the Edomites were often under the control of Israel, as seen during the reigns of King David and King Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-22</a>). This servitude fulfills the earlier prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where it was foretold that the older would serve the younger. The theme of serving one's brother can also be seen as a reversal of expectations, a common motif in biblical narratives, where God's plans often subvert human norms.<p><b>But when you rebel,</b><br>This phrase suggests a future breaking free from subjugation. The Edomites did indeed rebel against Israelite control at various points in history. One notable rebellion occurred during the reign of King Jehoram of Judah, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>. This rebellion signifies a temporary assertion of independence and reflects the ongoing tension between the two nations. The concept of rebellion is also a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with human attempts to assert autonomy against divine or established authority.<p><b>you will tear his yoke from your neck.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of a yoke represents oppression and servitude. Tearing off the yoke signifies liberation and freedom from domination. This prophecy was fulfilled when the Edomites gained independence from Judah, as mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-8.htm">2 Chronicles 21:8-10</a>. The yoke is a powerful biblical symbol of bondage, seen in other contexts such as the Israelites' slavery in Egypt (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>) and the spiritual yoke of sin (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). The act of breaking free from a yoke can also be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He offers freedom from the bondage of sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, who was tricked out of his blessing by his younger brother Jacob.

The man who was already &#8220;a skillful hunter, a man of the field&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>) would father a nation that keeps that rough-edged identity.<p>&#8226; History bears it out. From the rugged heights of Seir, Edom depended on raiding and military strength (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4&#8211;5</a>). When Saul fought neighboring enemies he &#8220;fought against Edom&#8221; as well (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), and centuries later Amaziah struck ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The sword also hints at an unending restlessness. <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 1</a> addresses Edom&#8217;s violence, showing that the prophecy was not a compliment but a sober warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and serve your brother</b><p>&#8226; Although Esau was the elder, God had declared, &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Isaac now confirms that Jacob&#8217;s offspring (Israel) will hold the upper hand.<p>&#8226; David &#8220;established garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David&#8217;s servants&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>). Solomon&#8217;s campaigns continued that dominance (<a href="/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; This servitude is not merely political; it pictures how God&#8217;s sovereign choice prevails even when circumstances suggest otherwise (<a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10&#8211;13</a> echoes this truth).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But when you rebel</b><p>&#8226; The word translated &#8220;rebel&#8221; points to a restless resolve to shake off domination. Scripture records several flare-ups:<p>&#8211; During Jehoram&#8217;s reign, &#8220;Edom rebelled from under the hand of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8211; Ahaz later lost the port of Elath when &#8220;the Edomites came again and struck Judah&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Each revolt illustrates both the resilience of Esau&#8217;s descendants and the instability that comes from trusting the sword rather than the Lord (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will tear his yoke from your neck</b><p>&#8226; Revolt does bring Edom seasons of autonomy. The yoke that David once placed is lifted for a time, fulfilling Isaac&#8217;s forecast.<p>&#8226; Yet every brief independence is short-lived. Malachi reminds us that even though Edom may say, &#8220;We will rebuild,&#8221; the Lord replies, &#8220;They may build, but I will tear down&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The image of a shattered yoke also offers a broader lesson: earthly tyranny is temporary, and God alone assigns or removes it (<a href="/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5&#8211;7</a>). Edom breaks free now and then, but never escapes divine oversight (<a href="/obadiah/1-15.htm">Obadiah 1:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a> foretells the turbulent history of Esau&#8217;s descendants.

The verse underscores both the reliability of God&#8217;s promises and the futility of wrestling against His purposes with mere human strength.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(40) <span class= "bld">When thou shalt have the dominion.</span>--This rendering of a rare and difficult Hebrew word is scarcely more than a guess made by two or three ancient Jewish commentators.

The prophecy of Edom's subjection to his brother was literally fulfilled, as Idumaea was for ages a mere dependency upon Judah; but in the days first of Joram, and then of Ahaz, it revolted, and recovered its freedom. It was again conquered by Hyrcanus, the nephew of Judas Maccabaeus; nor was its subject condition altered by the fact that the dynasty of the Herods was of Edomite extraction. In troubled times, then, it broke the yoke from its neck; but generally Edom served his brother.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And by thy sword shalt thou live</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">upon thy sword shalt thou</span> be, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy maintenance shall depend on thy sword; a prediction that Esau s descendants should be a warlike and tumultuous people of predatory habits (cf.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;</span>, used of beasts which have broken the yoke and wander freely about (Gesenius, Furst), appear to hint at an incessant restlessness on the part of Edom while under Israel's yoke which should eventually terminate in regaining their independence. The exact rendering of the clause is obscure, but perhaps means that when Edom should roam about as a freebooter (Lange), or should revolt (Alford), or should toss, shake, or struggle against the yoke (Vulgate, Keil, Hengstenberg, 'Speaker's Commentary), he should succeed. Other renderings are, when thou shalt bear rule (Kimchi), when thou shalt repent (Jarchi), when thou shalt be strong (Samaritan), when thou prevailest (Murphy), when thou shalt truly desire it (Kalisch), when thou shalt pull down (LXX.);
