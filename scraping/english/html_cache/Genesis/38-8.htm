His actions and decisions are pivotal in the unfolding story of the Israelites. This command to Onan reflects the cultural and familial responsibilities of the time. Judah's directive is rooted in the levirate marriage custom, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>&#8220;Sleep with your brother&#8217;s wife.</b><br>The practice of levirate marriage, where a man is expected to marry his deceased brother's widow, is intended to preserve the family line and inheritance. This custom is later codified in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>). The act of sleeping with the brother's wife was not merely for personal gratification but was a duty to ensure the continuation of the deceased brother's lineage.<p><b>Perform your duty as her brother-in-law</b><br>The duty mentioned here is a legal and social obligation. In the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, maintaining the family name and property within the tribe was crucial. This duty was not only a familial responsibility but also a way to provide for the widow, ensuring her protection and place within the community.<p><b>and raise up offspring for your brother.&#8221;</b><br>The primary purpose of this union was to produce an heir for the deceased brother, thus preserving his name and inheritance. This concept of raising up offspring is significant in biblical narratives, as lineage and heritage are central themes. The importance of offspring is seen throughout Scripture, with genealogies often highlighting the fulfillment of God's promises through descendants. This practice also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who is born into the line of Judah, emphasizing the importance of lineage in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The fourth son of Jacob and Leah, Judah is a central figure in this account.

Its object, first of all, was to prevent the extinction of any line of descent, a matter of great importance in those genealogical days; and, secondly, it was an obstacle to the accumulation of landed property in few hands, as the son first born after the Levirate marriage inherited the property of his deceased uncle, while the second son was the representative of the real father. A similar custom existed in parts of India, Persia, &c, and prevails now among the Mongols. The Mosaic Law did not institute, but regulated the custom, confining such marriages to cases where the deceased brother had died without children, and permitting the brother to refuse to marry the widow, under a penalty, nevertheless, of disgrace. Onan, by refusing to take Tamar, may have been actuated by the selfish motive of obtaining for himself the rights of primogeniture, which would otherwise have gone to his eldest son, as the heir of his uncle 'Er.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judah said unto Onan</span> (obviously after a sufficient interval), <span class="cmt_word">Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">and perform the part of levir, or husband's brother, to her</span>.
