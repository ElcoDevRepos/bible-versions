Her actions are driven by the prophecy she received during her pregnancy, where God told her that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). This phrase highlights her favoritism towards Jacob, which contrasts with Isaac's preference for Esau. This family dynamic sets the stage for the unfolding events. Rebekah's involvement in the deception of Isaac reflects the complex interplay of divine sovereignty and human agency.<p><b>Behold, I overheard your father</b><br>Rebekah's eavesdropping indicates her active involvement in the family affairs and her determination to ensure the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding her sons. This phrase suggests a sense of urgency and secrecy, as she takes immediate action upon hearing Isaac's intentions. It also reflects the cultural context of the time, where oral communication was primary, and overhearing conversations could significantly impact family dynamics.<p><b>Saying to your brother Esau</b><br>Esau, the elder twin, is traditionally entitled to the birthright and blessing. However, his earlier decision to sell his birthright to Jacob for a meal (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>) foreshadows the loss of his father's blessing. This phrase underscores the tension between the brothers and the unfolding of God's plan, as Rebekah seeks to intervene in the natural order of inheritance. The mention of Esau also highlights the theme of sibling rivalry, a recurring motif in Genesis, seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, and later, Joseph and his brothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

Together they show God&#8217;s sovereignty working through imperfect people to fulfill His unchanging promise that the older would serve the younger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rebekah</span> (having already formed a plan for diverting the patriarchal blessing from Esau, whose habit of life and utterly unspiritual character may perhaps have recalled to her mind and confirmed the declaration of the oracle concerning Jacob's precedence) <span class="cmt_word">spake unto Jacob her son,</span> - i.e. her favorite, in contrast to Esau, Isaac s son (ver. 5) - <span class="cmt_word">saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring me venison</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">and make me savory meat, that I may eat</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and I shall eat</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and bless thee</span> - the lengthened form of the future in this and the preceding verb (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in ver. 4) is expressive of Isaac's self-excitement and emphatic determination - <span class="cmt_word">before the Lord.</span> The word Jehovah, by modern criticism regarded as a sign of divided authorship, is satisfactorily explained by remembering that Rebekah is speaking not of the blessing of God's general pro<span class="accented">vide</span>nce, but of the higher benediction of the covenant (Hengstenberg). The phrase, though not included in Isaac's address to Esau, need not be regarded as due to Rebekah's invention. She may have understood it to be implied in her husband's language, though it was not expressed (cf. <a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>). That it was designedly omitted by Isaac in consequence of the worldly character of Esau appears as little likely as that it was deliberately inserted by Rebekah to whet her favorite's ambition (Kalisch). As to meaning, the sense may be that this patriarchal benediction was to be bestowed sincerely (Menochius), in presence and by the authority of God (Ainsworth, Bush, Clericus); but the use of the term <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> rather points to the idea that Rebekah regarded Isaac simply "as the instrument of the living and personal God, who directed the concerns of the chosen race (Hengstenberg). <span class="cmt_word">Before my death.</span> Since Rebekah makes no remark as to the groundlessness of Isaac s fear, it is not improbable that she too shared in her bed-ridden husband's expectations that already he was "in the presence of" his end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Rebekah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ri&#7687;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7259.htm">Strong's 7259: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rebekah -- wife of Isaac</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jacob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
