In the broader context of <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, these men are identified as divine messengers. Their turning toward Sodom signifies the impending judgment on the city due to its wickedness, as described in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. The geographical location of Sodom, near the Dead Sea, is significant for its historical and archaeological implications, with evidence suggesting the area was once fertile but later became desolate. This movement toward Sodom sets the stage for the events of <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, where the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is detailed.<p><b>but Abraham remained standing before the LORD</b><br>Abraham's position here is one of intercession. Standing before the LORD indicates a posture of prayer and negotiation, as Abraham pleads for the righteous within Sodom. This reflects a cultural and historical practice where individuals would stand before a king or judge to make a petition. Abraham's boldness in intercession is a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Theologically, this moment underscores the relationship between God and His chosen people, highlighting themes of justice, mercy, and covenant. Abraham's dialogue with God also foreshadows the role of prophets and leaders in Israel who would stand in the gap for the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
