The mention of Milcah connects to earlier genealogies, showing the interconnectedness of Abraham's family.<p><b>to your brother Nahor</b><br>Nahor is Abraham's brother, and this reference situates the narrative within the broader family context.

It has been noticed that Nahor has twelve sons, eight by his lawful wife, and four by his concubine. So Jacob has twelve sons, eight by two lawful wives, and four by two concubines. Lastly, Ishmael has twelve sons. These coincidences are curious, but afford no ground for the assertion that therefore these narratives are mythical.
