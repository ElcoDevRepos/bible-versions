It echoes <a href="/genesis/11-5.htm">Genesis 11:5</a>, where God "came down" to see the Tower of Babel. This anthropomorphic language emphasizes God's justice and thoroughness. It also reflects the biblical theme of God being intimately aware of human actions, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>.<p><b>if their actions fully justify the outcry</b><br>The "outcry" refers to the grievous sins of Sodom and Gomorrah, which have reached a level demanding divine attention. This concept of an "outcry" is often associated with injustice and oppression, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God hears the cries of the Israelites in Egypt. The phrase underscores God's concern for justice and righteousness.<p><b>that has reached Me</b><br>This indicates that God is aware of the moral state of humanity and responds to it. The idea of prayers or cries reaching God is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>. It highlights God's omniscience and His responsiveness to human suffering and sin.<p><b>If not, I will find out.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase suggests a thorough and fair investigation before judgment is executed. It reflects God's justice and patience, ensuring that any action taken is based on truth. This principle of divine investigation is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the final judgment in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>, emphasizing accountability and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, who is expressing His intention to investigate the situation in Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>The cities whose actions have prompted an outcry to the LORD, leading to His decision to investigate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/outcry.htm">Outcry</a></b><br>The term used to describe the grievous sin and injustice occurring in Sodom and Gomorrah, which has reached the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the recipient of the LORD's revelation and intercedes for the cities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/angelic_visitors.htm">Angelic Visitors</a></b><br>The messengers who accompany the LORD and later visit Sodom to carry out the investigation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God is both just and merciful.

But the ellipse is harsh; and inquiry, the knowing and not the punishing, is the prominent thought in the words of Jehovah. Hence too the last clause, "I will know." The two angels go to Sodom to give the people a final trial.
