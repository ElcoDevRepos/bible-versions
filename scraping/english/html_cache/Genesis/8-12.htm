Noah's patience reflects his obedience and trust in God's timing. This period of waiting emphasizes the importance of divine timing in the unfolding of God's plans.<p><b>and sent out the dove again</b><br>The dove is a symbol of peace and the Holy Spirit. In the context of the flood narrative, the dove's mission was to find dry land, indicating the end of God's judgment and the beginning of renewal. This act of sending the dove parallels the sending of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, who brings peace and guidance.<p><b>but this time she did not return to him</b><br>The dove's failure to return signified that the waters had receded sufficiently for life to begin anew on earth. This moment marks a transition from judgment to restoration. It foreshadows the new creation in Christ, where believers are given new life and hope. The absence of the dove also signifies the completion of God's promise to preserve Noah and his family, as well as the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve life on earth.
