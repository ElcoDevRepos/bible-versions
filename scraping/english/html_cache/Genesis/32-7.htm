This emotional turmoil reflects the human condition when facing the consequences of past actions. The fear is compounded by the news that Esau is approaching with 400 men (<a href="/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>), suggesting a potential threat. This moment of fear is a turning point for Jacob, leading him to seek divine intervention through prayer (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9-12</a>). It highlights the biblical theme of reliance on God in times of trouble, a recurring motif throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).<p><b>Jacob divided his people into two camps</b><br>Jacob's strategic decision to divide his people into two camps is a practical response to his fear, aiming to preserve at least part of his family and possessions in case of an attack. This action reflects the wisdom and prudence often necessary in leadership and crisis management. The division into two camps also echoes the earlier division of Jacob's family and possessions when he initially left Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-17.htm">Genesis 31:17-18</a>). This tactic underscores the importance of preparation and planning, even while trusting in God's protection.<p><b>as well as the flocks and herds and camels</b><br>The mention of flocks, herds, and camels indicates Jacob's wealth, which he had accumulated during his time with Laban (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>). These possessions are not only a sign of prosperity but also a potential source of conflict, as wealth often was in ancient times. The inclusion of camels, in particular, suggests a level of affluence, as camels were valuable for long-distance travel and trade. This detail provides insight into the economic and social status of Jacob's household. The preservation of these assets is crucial for Jacob's future, as they represent God's blessing and provision, fulfilling the promise made to Abraham regarding prosperity and descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

He has just learned that Esau is approaching with 400 men (<a href="/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>), rekindling memories of Esau&#8217;s threat to kill him after the stolen blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture does not sanitize fear; even the patriarchs felt it. David admits, &#8220;When I am afraid, I put my trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God often meets His servants at the point of trembling: Moses hid his face in fear at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>); Joshua heard, &#8220;Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD your God is with you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s distress sets the stage for dependence on God. Paul later echoes, &#8220;Do not be anxious about anything&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>), reminding us that fear is a call to prayer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jacob divided his people</b><p>&#8226; Fear does not paralyze Jacob; it pushes him to plan. &#8220;The prudent see danger and take cover&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership means protecting those under your care. Just as David organized his men (<a href="/2_samuel/18-1.htm">2 Samuel 18:1-2</a>), Jacob takes tangible steps for safety.<p>&#8226; Wise action and faith go hand in hand; Nehemiah both prayed and set a guard (<a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into two camps</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;camps&#8221; recalls the earlier encounter with angels at Mahanaim, meaning &#8220;two camps&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-1.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>). Jacob applies spiritual insight to practical life.<p>&#8226; Dividing the group limits potential loss: &#8220;If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the other camp can escape&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-8.htm">Genesis 32:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus later advises a blend of wisdom and innocence: &#8220;Be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as well as the flocks and herds and camels</b><p>&#8226; Livestock represent both wealth and covenant blessing (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>).

Jacob&#8217;s terror drives him to careful planning&#8212;dividing people and possessions to spare them&#8212;while setting the stage for deeper reliance on God. The verse invites us to acknowledge real emotions, exercise practical wisdom, steward God-given resources, and ultimately trust the Lord who turns our camps of fear into testimonies of His faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Jacob was greatly afraid.</span>--Jacob's message to his brother had been very humble, for he calls Esau his lord, and himself a servant. He hopes also to "find grace in his sight," and by enumerating his wealth shows that he required no aid, nor need claim even a share of Isaac's property. But Esau had given no answer, being probably undecided as to the manner in which he would receive his brother. The "four hundred men with him" formed probably only a part of the little army with which he had invaded the Horite territory. Some would be left with the spoil which he had gathered, but he took so many with him as to place Jacob completely in his power. And Jacob's extreme distress, in spite of the Divine encouragement repeatedly given him, shows that his faith was very feeble; but it was real, and therefore he sought refuge from his terror in prayer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed</span>: - literally, <span class="accented">it was narrow to him</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he was perplexed.
