The context is a heated discussion following the events in Shechem, where their sister Dinah was defiled by Shechem, the son of Hamor. The brothers' reply reflects their anger and justification for their actions. This dialogue occurs after they have taken violent revenge on the city of Shechem, which they felt was necessary to defend their sister's honor.<p><b>&#8220;Should he have treated</b><br>The use of the word "treated" implies an action that was done to Dinah, highlighting the violation and disrespect she suffered. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, a woman's honor was closely tied to her family's honor, and any mistreatment was seen as a grave offense not only against the individual but against the entire family. This reflects the patriarchal society where family honor was paramount.<p><b>our sister</b><br>The phrase "our sister" emphasizes the familial bond and the protective instincts of Dinah's brothers. In the tribal and family-oriented culture of the time, the well-being and reputation of a sister were the responsibility of her brothers. This familial duty is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where family loyalty and protection are highly valued.<p><b>like a prostitute?&#8221;</b><br>The comparison to a prostitute underscores the severity of the offense in the eyes of Simeon and Levi. In biblical times, prostitution was often associated with shame and dishonor. By using this analogy, the brothers express their outrage at the degradation of Dinah's dignity. This phrase also highlights the moral and ethical standards of the time, where sexual purity was highly esteemed, and any deviation was met with severe consequences. The brothers' reaction can be seen as a defense of their sister's honor and a rejection of any attempt to normalize or excuse the violation she endured.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Sons of Jacob and Leah, who took a leading role in avenging their sister Dinah's defilement by Shechem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>The daughter of Jacob and Leah, who was violated by Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The son of Hamor, who defiled Dinah and sought to marry her.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, who attempted to negotiate a marriage between his son and Dinah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, who was initially passive in response to Dinah's defilement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger_vs._sinful_vengeance.htm">Righteous Anger vs. Sinful Vengeance</a></b><br>While anger at injustice is natural, Simeon and Levi's response shows how easily it can turn into sinful vengeance.
