It suggests a period of growth and development for Isaac, who is now likely a young boy. The timing emphasizes the ongoing journey of faith and obedience in Abraham's life.<p><b>God tested Abraham</b><br>The concept of testing is significant in Scripture, often used to refine and prove the faith of God's people. This test is not for God's knowledge, as He is omniscient, but for Abraham's growth and the demonstration of his faith. It foreshadows the testing of faith seen in the lives of other biblical figures, such as Job and the Israelites in the wilderness. This test is a precursor to the ultimate test of faith and obedience seen in Jesus Christ's life and sacrifice.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Abraham!&#8221;</b><br>The direct address by God highlights the personal relationship between God and Abraham. It echoes previous divine encounters, such as God's call to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. The use of Abraham's name signifies the importance of the message and the intimacy of the communication. This personal call is reminiscent of God's calling of other key figures, such as Moses at the burning bush and Samuel in the temple.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Abraham's response indicates readiness and willingness to listen and obey. This phrase is a common biblical expression of availability and submission to God's will, seen in the responses of other faithful servants like Moses, Samuel, and Isaiah. It reflects a heart posture of obedience and trust, setting the stage for the profound act of faith that follows. Abraham's readiness is a type of Christ's obedience to the Father's will, culminating in His sacrificial death on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The supreme being who tests Abraham's faith and obedience.

For twenty-five years the patriarch had wandered in Palestine, and seen the fulfilment of the promise perpetually deferred, and yet his faith failed not. At length the long wished for heir is born, and, excepting the grievous pain of parting with Ishmael, all went well with him, and seemed to presage a calm and happy old age. He was at peace with his neighbours, had quiet possession of ample pasture for his cattle, knew that Ishmael was prosperous, and saw Isaac fast approaching man's estate (<a href="/genesis/22-12.htm" title="And he said, Lay not your hand on the lad, neither do you any thing to him: for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me.">Genesis 22:12</a>). In the midst, nevertheless, of this tranquil evening of his days came the severest trial of all; for he was commanded to slay his son. The trial was twofold. For, first, human sacrifice was abhorrent to the nature of Jehovah, and Abraham's clear duty would be to prove the command. Could such a deed really be enjoined upon him by God? Now no subjective proof would be sufficient. In after times many an Israelite was moved by deep religious fanaticism to give his firstborn in the hope of appeasing the anger of God at his sin (<a href="/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>); but instead of peace it brought only a deeper condemnation upon his soul. Had Abraham been moved only by an internal and subjective impulse, his conduct would have deserved and met with similar condemnation But when, upon examination, he became convinced that the command came from outside himself, and from the same God with whom on former occasions he had so often held converse, then the antecedents of his own life required of him obedience. But even when satisfied of this, there was, secondly, the trial of his faith. A command which he had tested, not only subjectively by prayer, but objectively by comparison with the manner of previous revelations, bade him with his own hand destroy the son in whom "his seed was to be called." His love for his child, his previous faith in the promise, the religious value and worth of Isaac as the appointed means for the blessing of all mankind--this, and more besides, stood arrayed against the command. But Abraham, in spite of all, obeyed, and in proportion to the greatness of the trial was the greatness of the reward. Up to this time his faith had been proved by patience and endurance, but now he was bidden himself to destroy the fruit of so many years of patient waiting (<a href="/context/hebrews/11-17.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,">Hebrews 11:17-19</a>), and, assured that the command came from God, he wavered not. Thus by trial was his own faith made perfect, and for Isaac too there was blessing. Meekly, as befitted the type of Christ, he submitted to his father's will, and the life restored to him was henceforth dedicated to God. But there was a higher purpose in the command than the spiritual good of these 'two saints. The sacrifice had for its object the instruction of the whole Church of God. If the act had possessed no typical value, it would have been difficult for us to reconcile to our consciences a command which might have seemed, indirectly at least, to have authorised human sacrifices. But there was in it the setting forth of the mystery of the Father giving the Son to die for the sins of the world; and therein lies both the value and the justification of Abraham's conduct and of the Divine command.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it cams to pass</span> - the alleged mythical character of the present narrative (De Wette, Bohlen) is discredited not more by express Scripture statement (<a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17-19</a>) than by its own inherent difficulties - <span class="cmt_word">after</span> - how long after may be conjectured from the circumstance that Isaac was now a grown lad, capable of undertaking a three days journey of upwards of sixty miles - <span class="cmt_word">these things</span> (literally, words, of benediction, promise, trial that had gone before - <span class="cmt_word">that God</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the Elohim, i.e.</span> neither Satan, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, compared with <a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> (Schelling, Stanley), nor Abraham himself, in the sense that a subjective impulse on the part of the patriarch supplied the formal basis of the subsequent transaction (Kurtz, Oehler);
