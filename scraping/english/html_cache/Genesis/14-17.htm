Chedorlaomer was a powerful king who led a coalition of four kings against five rebellious kings in the region, including the king of Sodom. Abram's successful military campaign, with only 318 trained men, highlights his strategic prowess and God's intervention. This event foreshadows the future victories of Israel over seemingly insurmountable foes, emphasizing reliance on divine assistance. It also prefigures Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as Abram acts as a deliverer for Lot, akin to Christ's role as the Redeemer.<p><b>the king of Sodom went out to meet him</b><br>The king of Sodom's approach to Abram after the battle is notable. Sodom, known for its wickedness, represents worldly values and corruption. The king's meeting with Abram contrasts with Melchizedek's later encounter, highlighting the choice between worldly wealth and spiritual blessing. This meeting sets the stage for Abram's refusal of the king's offer, demonstrating his commitment to God's promise rather than earthly riches. This encounter can be seen as a test of Abram's faith and integrity, similar to the temptations faced by believers to compromise with worldly powers.<p><b>in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King&#8217;s Valley)</b><br>The Valley of Shaveh, also known as the King&#8217;s Valley, is traditionally identified with the Kidron Valley near Jerusalem. This location is significant as it later becomes associated with royal and religious events in Israel's history. The mention of the King&#8217;s Valley may symbolize a place of decision and covenant, as it is where Abram meets both the king of Sodom and Melchizedek, the king of Salem. This geographical setting foreshadows Jerusalem's future importance as the center of worship and the reign of the Davidic kings, ultimately pointing to the messianic reign of Christ, the King of Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in Genesis, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.
