This moment occurs during his departure from Laban, his father-in-law, after years of service. The term "relatives" refers to his family and servants who accompanied him. This reflects the patriarchal family structure common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where extended family units were integral to social and economic life.<p><b>&#8220;Gather some stones.&#8221;</b><br>The act of gathering stones is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a covenant or memorial. Stones were used to mark important events or agreements, as seen in <a href="/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20-24</a>, where stones were set up as a memorial of crossing the Jordan River. Here, the stones serve as a witness to the covenant between Jacob and Laban, emphasizing the importance of physical symbols in ancient agreements.<p><b>So they took stones and made a mound,</b><br>The creation of a mound, or heap of stones, is a common practice in ancient times for marking significant locations or events. This mound, called "Galeed" by Laban and "Jegar-sahadutha" in Aramaic, serves as a witness to the covenant between Jacob and Laban. Such mounds were often used as boundary markers or memorials, as seen in other biblical accounts like <a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>, where Jacob sets up a stone pillar at Bethel.<p><b>and there by the mound they ate.</b><br>Sharing a meal by the mound signifies the sealing of the covenant. In ancient Near Eastern culture, eating together was a sign of fellowship and agreement. This act of communal eating is reminiscent of other biblical covenants, such as the meal shared by Moses, Aaron, and the elders of Israel in <a href="/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>.
