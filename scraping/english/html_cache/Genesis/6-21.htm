It emphasizes the direct command from God to Noah, highlighting the importance of obedience and preparation. In the context of Genesis, Noah is seen as a righteous man chosen by God to preserve life. This command reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where individuals are entrusted with responsibilities by God. The personal nature of the command underscores the intimate relationship between God and Noah, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in the calling of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>).<p><b>every kind of food that is eaten</b><br>This phrase suggests a comprehensive gathering of sustenance, indicating the variety and abundance of God's provision. It reflects the dietary practices of the time, which would have included grains, fruits, vegetables, and possibly preserved meats. The emphasis on "every kind" points to the necessity of sustaining both human and animal life during the flood. This mirrors the later provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16), where God provides for the Israelites' needs. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of God's provision for all needs (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><b>and gather it</b><br>The act of gathering implies diligence and foresight. Noah's obedience in gathering food is an act of faith, trusting in God's warning about the impending flood. This gathering can be seen as a type of the church's mission to gather souls, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The gathering also reflects the principle of preparation and readiness, akin to the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), where preparedness is crucial.<p><b>as food for yourselves</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of self-preservation and care for one's family. It underscores the importance of providing for one's household, a principle echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, where providing for one's family is seen as a fundamental duty. The inclusion of "yourselves" indicates that Noah's family is central to God's plan for post-flood humanity, preserving the line through which the Messiah would eventually come.<p><b>and for the animals.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the care for all of God's creation. It reflects the dominion mandate given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humans are tasked with stewarding the earth and its creatures. The inclusion of animals in God's preservation plan points to their value in creation and their role in the post-flood world. This care for animals can be seen as a precursor to the peaceable kingdom prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where harmony between humans and animals is restored. The preservation of animal life also foreshadows the redemption of all creation, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.
