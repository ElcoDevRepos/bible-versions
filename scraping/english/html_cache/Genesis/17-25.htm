His birth is recorded in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>, where Sarah, unable to bear children, gives Hagar to Abraham as a wife. Ishmael's name, meaning "God hears," reflects God's response to Hagar's distress in the wilderness. Ishmael is significant in biblical history as the ancestor of many Arab nations, and his story highlights themes of God's faithfulness and the complexities of human relationships. His role in the narrative sets the stage for the covenantal promises that will later be fulfilled through Isaac, Abraham's son with Sarah.<p><b>was thirteen;</b><br>The age of thirteen is significant in the Jewish tradition, as it marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, known as Bar Mitzvah in later Jewish practice. At this age, Ishmael is on the cusp of manhood, which is important in the context of <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, where God establishes the covenant of circumcision with Abraham. Ishmael's circumcision at thirteen signifies his inclusion in the covenant, although he is not the child of promise through whom the covenant will be fulfilled. This age also underscores the timeline of events leading to the birth of Isaac, who will be born a year later, as God had promised. The mention of Ishmael's age serves to highlight the unfolding of God's plan and the distinction between Ishmael and Isaac in the narrative of God's covenant with Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The first son of Abraham, born to Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant.
