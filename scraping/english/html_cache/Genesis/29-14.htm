This phrase emphasizes the importance of kinship ties in ancient Near Eastern culture, where family loyalty and obligations were paramount. The phrase "flesh and blood" signifies a deep connection, often implying mutual support and protection. This familial recognition sets the stage for the ensuing narrative, where Laban's treatment of Jacob will be influenced by this relationship. The phrase also echoes the biblical theme of kinship seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>, where Adam recognizes Eve as "bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh," highlighting the unity and bond within family.<p><b>After Jacob had stayed with him a month,</b><br>The mention of a month indicates a significant period during which Jacob would have been integrated into Laban's household, observing and participating in daily life. This time frame suggests a period of testing or probation, common in ancient cultures, where a guest or potential family member would prove their worth and intentions. The month-long stay also reflects the hospitality customs of the time, where extended family members were welcomed and cared for. This period allowed Jacob to become familiar with Laban's family and operations, setting the stage for his future work and the unfolding of God's plan for him. The duration of a month is also symbolic in biblical narratives, often representing a complete cycle or period of preparation, as seen in other instances like the mourning period for Moses in <a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob is on a journey to find a wife from his mother's family.

While words of kinship should guarantee safety (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>), Laban will exploit Jacob, illustrating that human promises can fail even within family&#8212;yet God remains faithful (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3-7</a>).<p>&#8226; This recognition fulfills Rebekah&#8217;s hope that Jacob would find refuge with her brother (<a href="/genesis/27-43.htm">Genesis 27:43-45</a>), keeping alive the line through which Messiah will come (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>After Jacob had stayed with him a month</b><p>&#8226; A trial period allowed Laban to observe Jacob&#8217;s character and skills, mirroring Moses&#8217; later month-long stay with Jethro before marriage to Zipporah (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15-21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob serves without wages, foreshadowing his fourteen-year labor for Rachel and Leah.

Though Laban&#8217;s later actions will test Jacob, the Lord uses this family connection to multiply the patriarch, preserve the promised line, and showcase divine faithfulness amid human frailty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The space of a month.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">a month of days, </span>that is, a full month.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said unto him</span> (giving utterance to the impression Jacob s recital had produced upon his mind), <span class="cmt_word">Surely thou art my bone and my flesh</span> - i.e. my blood relation (cf. <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>).
