The mention of a Canaanite woman is significant, as the Canaanites were often seen as a people with different religious practices and moral values, which were contrary to those of the Israelites. This union foreshadows potential conflicts and challenges, as intermarriage with Canaanites was generally discouraged (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). The name "Shua" is not common, and little is known about him, but his mention indicates the importance of lineage and family connections in biblical narratives.<p><b>and he took her as a wife</b><br>The act of taking a Canaanite woman as a wife by Judah is a pivotal moment, reflecting a departure from the practices of his forefathers, who sought to marry within their own kin (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>, <a href="/genesis/28.htm">Genesis 28:1-2</a>). This decision may have been influenced by Judah's separation from his brothers and his desire to establish his own household. The cultural context of marriage during this time often involved familial arrangements and alliances, which could have implications for inheritance and social standing.<p><b>and slept with her</b><br>This phrase indicates the consummation of the marriage, which was a significant step in establishing a family line. In biblical times, the act of sleeping with one's wife was not only a physical union but also a covenantal act that often led to the continuation of a family lineage. This union would eventually lead to the birth of Judah's sons, who play crucial roles in the unfolding narrative of Israel's history. The mention of this act underscores the importance of progeny and the fulfillment of God's promises through the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The fourth son of Jacob and Leah, Judah is a significant figure in the lineage of Jesus Christ.
