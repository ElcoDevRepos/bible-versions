He is now in Egypt, having risen to a position of power. The "both of them" refers to his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, born to him in Egypt. This moment is significant as it involves the blessing of his sons by Jacob, a patriarchal tradition that carries prophetic and covenantal significance.<p><b>with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel&#8217;s left hand,</b><br>Ephraim, the younger son, is positioned by Joseph in such a way that he would receive the blessing from Jacob's left hand, traditionally the lesser blessing. The right hand was considered the hand of greater honor and power, often associated with strength and favor. This positioning reflects Joseph's expectation of the traditional order of blessing, where the firstborn receives the primary blessing.<p><b>and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel&#8217;s right hand&#8212;</b><br>Manasseh, the firstborn, is placed to receive the blessing from Jacob's right hand, indicating the expectation of the greater blessing. This reflects the cultural norm of primogeniture, where the firstborn son receives a double portion of inheritance and leadership within the family. However, this narrative foreshadows a reversal of expectations, a common theme in biblical stories where God often chooses the younger or the unexpected to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and brought them close to him.</b><br>Joseph brings his sons close to Jacob, signifying the intimate and personal nature of the blessing. This act of drawing near is symbolic of the transmission of covenantal promises and blessings from one generation to the next. It also highlights the importance of family and lineage in the biblical narrative, as well as the continuation of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob through their descendants. This moment is a precursor to the tribes of Israel, with Ephraim and Manasseh becoming two of the twelve tribes, despite being grandsons of Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob (Israel) and Rachel, who rose to prominence in Egypt.
