In the context of Genesis, this regret does not imply a mistake by God but rather a change in His relationship with humanity due to their sinfulness. The Hebrew word used here, "nacham," can mean to be sorry, to console oneself, or to repent. It reflects God's sorrow over human wickedness. This anthropomorphic expression helps readers grasp the depth of God's emotional response to sin.<p><b>that He had made man on the earth,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the specific focus of God's regret: the creation of humanity. It underscores the gravity of human sin, which has corrupted the original purpose of creation. The earth, initially created as a good and harmonious place (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>), has become a stage for human rebellion. This sets the stage for the forthcoming judgment through the flood, which serves as both a cleansing and a new beginning for creation.<p><b>and He was grieved in His heart.</b><br>The grief of God is a profound expression of His personal investment in creation. The term "grieved" suggests deep emotional pain, akin to a parent mourning over a wayward child. This phrase emphasizes God's relational nature and His desire for a righteous relationship with humanity. It also foreshadows the ultimate solution to sin through Jesus Christ, who would bear the grief and sorrow of humanity's sin (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-4</a>). This grief is not just an emotional response but a catalyst for divine action, leading to the redemptive plan that unfolds throughout the rest of Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal relationship with creation and His sovereignty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man (Humanity)</a></b><br>Refers to the human race, which had become corrupt and wicked, prompting God's response.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The setting of humanity's actions and the stage for God's unfolding plan of redemption.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/regret_and_grief_of_god.htm">Regret and Grief of God</a></b><br>An anthropomorphic expression of God's response to human sinfulness, indicating deep sorrow and a change in His dealings with humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pre-flood_world.htm">Pre-Flood World</a></b><br>The context in which humanity's wickedness had reached a peak, leading to God's decision to bring about the flood.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_regret.htm">Understanding Divine Regret</a></b><br>God's regret is not like human regret; it does not imply a mistake but rather a sorrowful response to human sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin grieves God deeply, affecting His heart.

If we start with man's free will, everything will depend upon human choice and action. Both these sides must be true, though our mental powers are too limited to combine them. In Holy Scripture the latter view is kept more prominently in the foreground, because upon it depends human responsibility. Thus here, the overwhelming of mankind by a flood, and the subsequent abbreviation of life, is set before our eyes as painful to the Deity, and contrary to His goodwill towards men, but as necessitated by the extreme depravity of even the chosen Sethite race.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it repented the Lord</span>. <span class="accented">Yinnahem</span>; from <span class="accented">naham</span>, to pant, to groan; Niph., to lament, to grieve bemuse of the misery of others, also because of one's own actions; whence to repent (cf.
