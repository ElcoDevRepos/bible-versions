The direction "eastward" is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing movement away from God's presence or divine favor, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> when Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. This journey reflects humanity's continued spread across the earth, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). The eastward movement also connects to the migration of Cain in <a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>, suggesting a recurring theme of separation and dispersion.<p><b>they found a plain in the land of Shinar</b><br>The land of Shinar is historically identified with the region of Mesopotamia, specifically the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This fertile plain is significant as it becomes the setting for the Tower of Babel narrative. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of early civilizations in this region, known for their advancements in agriculture and urban development. Shinar is later associated with Babylon, a city that becomes symbolic of human pride and rebellion against God throughout Scripture, notably in the Book of Revelation.<p><b>and settled there</b><br>The decision to settle in Shinar marks a pivotal moment in human history, as it represents a shift from nomadic life to urbanization and the establishment of cities. This settlement sets the stage for the construction of the Tower of Babel, an act of defiance against God's command to fill the earth. The desire to settle and build a city reflects humanity's inclination towards self-sufficiency and unity apart from God. This theme of human pride and rebellion is echoed in later biblical narratives, such as the construction of Babylon and its eventual downfall, serving as a type of the ultimate judgment against human arrogance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/people.htm">People</a></b><br>The descendants of Noah, who were repopulating the earth after the flood.

Mount Ararat was to the north-west of Shinar, and while so lofty a mountain could not have been the spot where the ark rested, yet neither could any portion of Armenia or of the Carduchian mountains be described as to the east of Babylonia. The Chaldean legends make the ark rest on Mount Nizir, or Elwend, on the east of Assyria; and though Ararat may possibly signify <span class= "ital">Aryaverta, </span>"Holy Land," yet the transference of the name from Elwend to Armenia is not easily explicable.
