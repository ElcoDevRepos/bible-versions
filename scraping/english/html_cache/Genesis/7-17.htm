Examples include the Israelites wandering in the desert for forty years (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus fasting for forty days in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This period of forty days of rain represents God's judgment on a sinful world, paralleling other biblical instances where forty signifies a time of purification or preparation.<p><b>the flood kept coming on the earth</b><br>The flood narrative is a central event in Genesis, marking a divine reset of creation due to humanity's pervasive wickedness (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>). The floodwaters are seen as an instrument of God's judgment, cleansing the earth of corruption. This event is also echoed in other ancient Near Eastern flood stories, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, though the biblical account emphasizes moral and theological themes.<p><b>and the waters rose</b><br>The rising waters symbolize the overwhelming nature of God's judgment. This phrase highlights the totality of the flood, covering all the earth and eradicating all life outside the ark. It serves as a reminder of God's power and the seriousness of sin. The rising waters can also be seen as a reversal of creation, where God initially separated the waters to create dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>).<p><b>and lifted the ark high above the earth</b><br>The ark, a vessel of salvation, is lifted above the destruction below, symbolizing God's provision and protection for Noah and his family. The ark can be seen as a type of Christ, offering salvation and refuge from judgment. Just as the ark was the only means of survival during the flood, Jesus is the only way to salvation (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The lifting of the ark also foreshadows the resurrection, where believers are raised to new life through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.

Forty often signals a period of divine testing or judgment, as in Israel&#8217;s forty years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus&#8217; forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, the literal forty-day deluge underscores God&#8217;s thorough judgment on a corrupt world (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>) while also highlighting His faithfulness to preserve Noah&#8217;s family (<a href="/genesis/6-18.htm">Genesis 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the flood kept coming on the earth</b><p>&#8226; The verb tense indicates a relentless, unstoppable event.

When the waters later recede (<a href="/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1-3</a>), Noah steps into a cleansed world, anticipating the new creation promised in <a href="/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17</a> details a literal, forty-day worldwide flood that relentlessly rose, lifting Noah&#8217;s ark above judgment.

The same waters that bring destruction raise the obedient to safety, pointing forward to the greater deliverance found in Christ (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17-19) <span class= "bld">The waters increased . . . --</span>The swelling of the flood is told with great power in these verses but every stage and detail has reference to the ark, as if the author of the narrative was one of those on board. First, the "waters increased," and raised up the ark till it floated. Next, "they became strong and increased exceedingly"--the word rendered "prevailed" really signifying the setting in of mighty currents (see on <a href="/genesis/8-1.htm" title="And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;">Genesis 8:1</a>), as the waters sought the lower ground--and at this stage the ark began to move. Finally, they "became strong exceedingly, exceedingly," rushing along with ever-increasing force, and carrying the ark high above every hill in its course. Of these it is said--<p><span class= "bld">All the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</span>--Interpreting this by the English Version, many regard it as a proof of the deluge having been universal. But omitting the well-known fact that in the Bible the word "all" means much less than with us, we must also remember that the Hebrew language has a very small vocabulary, and "the whole heaven" means simply <span class= "ital">the whole shy. </span>We with our composite language borrow a word for it from the Greek, and say "the whole horizon," that is, the whole heaven, bounded by the line of the spectators vision. So then here. Far and wide, in every direction, to the utmost reach of the beholder's gaze, no mountain was in sight. All was a surging waste of flood. But there is no idea here of the mountains of Auvergne, with the ashes of old-world volcanoes still reposing upon their craters, extinct from a time probably long anterior to the creation even of man. The mountains were those of the Noachian world, as limited as the Roman world of <a href="/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>, or even more so.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the flood was forty days upon the earth</span>.

The <span class="accented">third degree</span> of increase, marked by the <span class="accented">submergence</span> of the mountains. <span class="cmt_word">And all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.</span> A clear assertion of the universality of the Flood (Keil, Kalisch, Alford, Bush, Wordsworth); but the language does not necessarily imply more than that all the high hills beneath the spectator s heaven were submerged (cf. <a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-25.htm">Exodus 9:25</a>; <a href="/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>; <a href="/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25</a>, for instances in which the universal terms all and every must be taken with a limited signification); while it is almost certain that, had the narrator even designed to record only the fact that all the heights within the visible horizon had disappeared beneath the rising waters, he would have done so by saying that "all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered." While, then, it is admitted that the words may depict a complete submergence of the globe, it is maintained by many competent scholars that the necessities of exegesis only demand a partial inundation (Peele, Murphy, Taylor Lewis, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For forty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the flood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mab&#183;b&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
