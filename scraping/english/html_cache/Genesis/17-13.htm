It highlights that the covenant sign of circumcision was not limited to Abraham's direct descendants but extended to all males within his household, including servants and those acquired through purchase. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice where household members, regardless of their origin, were considered part of the family unit. The requirement for circumcision for all males signifies the comprehensive nature of God's covenant, symbolizing purity and dedication to God. This act of circumcision is a physical manifestation of the spiritual covenant, marking those who belong to God's chosen people. It prefigures the New Testament concept of spiritual circumcision of the heart, as seen in <a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a> and <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>, where true belonging to God is marked by inward transformation rather than external rites.<p><b>My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant.</b><br>The phrase "My covenant in your flesh" underscores the tangible and physical nature of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants. Circumcision serves as a perpetual sign of this covenant, a physical reminder of the promises God made to Abraham, including the promise of land, descendants, and blessing. The term "everlasting covenant" indicates the enduring nature of God's promises, which are not limited by time. This covenant is foundational to the identity of the Israelite people and their relationship with God. It also points forward to the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, which fulfills and transcends the Old Covenant. In the New Testament, the concept of an everlasting covenant is expanded to include all believers, Jew and Gentile alike, through faith in Christ, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>.

We have seen that even in early days his followers must have numbered six or seven hundred men (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a>), and they were growing in multitude all the rest of his life, and during the lifetime of Isaac. They were then divided between Esau and Jacob at Isaac's death (<a href="/genesis/35-27.htm" title="And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.">Genesis 35:27</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/36-6.htm" title="And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.">Genesis 36:6-7</a>), but the diminution in the number of Jacob's family thus caused must have been compensated by those whom he gathered for himself in Mesopotamia (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm" title="And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.">Genesis 30:43</a>). All his household went down with him into Egypt, as part of his <span class= "ital">taf, </span>translated "little ones" in <a href="/genesis/46-5.htm" title="And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.">Genesis 46:5</a>, but really signifying the whole body of dependents, men, women, and children. Placed there in the fruitful Delta, they would be counted as members of that tribe to the chief of which they belonged, and would swell the numbers of the vast host which left Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37</a>). The second point is, that as all who were circumcised were regarded as Israelites, so also circumcision was confined to the Israelites. It was not 'a catholic ordinance, intended, like baptism, for all people and all times. Nor was it primarily a religious institution. The bought slave was circumcised first, and instructed afterwards. No profession of faith was required, but he was admitted to the privilege in right of his master. The reason of this was that it was an admission into the Jewish nation first, and by consequence only into the church. It is one of the many points which distinguish slavery, as practised among the Jews, from the degrading form of it which existed in modem times, that from the days of Abram onwards the slave by being circumcised was proclaimed to be one of the same race and nation as his master, and thereby entitled to share in his national and religious privileges. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised</span>.
