The depletion of money suggests a barter economy was in place, where money was initially used to purchase grain until it was exhausted. This situation sets the stage for Joseph's administrative skills to shine, as he manages resources during a time of scarcity. The mention of Canaan alongside Egypt underscores the regional nature of the famine, as previously described in <a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>, where all countries came to Egypt to buy grain.<p><b>all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said</b><br>Joseph, as the vizier of Egypt, held significant authority and was responsible for the distribution of food. This reflects the trust Pharaoh placed in Joseph, as seen in <a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-41</a>, where Joseph was appointed over Pharaoh's house and all the land of Egypt. The Egyptians approaching Joseph directly indicates his central role in the crisis management and the people's reliance on his leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes?</b><br>The plea for food is a desperate cry for survival, emphasizing the severity of the famine. The Egyptians' direct appeal to Joseph highlights their dependence on his mercy and the centralized control of resources. This situation foreshadows the Israelites' future dependence on God for sustenance, as seen in the wilderness wanderings (Exodus 16). The phrase "before your eyes" suggests an appeal to Joseph's compassion and sense of responsibility.<p><b>For our funds have run out!&#8221;</b><br>The exhaustion of funds signifies the complete depletion of personal resources, forcing the Egyptians to seek alternative means of survival. This economic desperation sets the stage for the subsequent exchange of livestock, land, and eventually servitude for sustenance, as detailed in <a href="/genesis/47-16.htm">Genesis 47:16-25</a>.
