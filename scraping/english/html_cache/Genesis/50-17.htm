In the broader context of Genesis, Joseph's brothers are seeking reconciliation after their betrayal. This reflects the biblical theme of repentance and forgiveness, which is central to the narrative of Joseph and his brothers.<p><b>I beg you, please forgive the transgression and sin of your brothers:</b><br>The plea for forgiveness underscores the gravity of the brothers' actions against Joseph, which included selling him into slavery. The use of both "transgression" and "sin" emphasizes the seriousness of their wrongdoing. This reflects the biblical principle that true repentance involves acknowledging one's sins and seeking forgiveness. The request for forgiveness is a precursor to the New Testament teachings on forgiveness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14-15</a>.<p><b>for they did you wrong:</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the harm caused to Joseph, which is an essential step in the process of reconciliation. It is a confession of guilt, aligning with the biblical concept that confession is necessary for forgiveness. The wrong done to Joseph is a type of the suffering of Christ, who was also wronged by those He came to save.<p><b>So now, Joseph, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.&#8221;</b><br>This appeal to Joseph's faith and his father's God highlights the covenant relationship with God that the family shares. It serves as a reminder of the spiritual heritage and the importance of maintaining unity among God's people. The reference to "the God of your father" connects to the patriarchal promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant.<p><b>When their message came to him, Joseph wept.</b><br>Joseph's weeping reveals his deep emotional response, indicating both his compassion and the pain of past wounds. This mirrors the heart of God, who is moved by repentance and seeks restoration. Joseph's tears can be seen as a type of Christ's compassion, as Jesus wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>) and at the tomb of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), showing His empathy and love for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.

they aim to remove any chance of misunderstanding (compare <a href="/numbers/32-25.htm">Numbers 32:25-27</a>, where the tribes carefully articulate their pledge).<p>&#8226; The request shows they still fear Joseph&#8217;s authority even after years of safety in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-9.htm">Genesis 45:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I beg you</b><p>A tone of earnest entreaty colors the plea.<p>&#8226;
