In the ancient Near Eastern context, a servant's success would reflect on the master, making Potiphar's awareness significant. It suggests a close relationship where Potiphar was attentive to Joseph's work and character.<p><b>that the LORD was with him</b><br>The presence of the LORD with Joseph is a recurring theme in his life, signifying divine favor and blessing. This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament. It echoes God's promise to be with His chosen ones, similar to His presence with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This divine presence is a type of Christ, who is called "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and made him prosper</b><br>Joseph's prosperity is attributed directly to the LORD's intervention, not merely his own abilities. This reflects the biblical principle that true success comes from God. It also foreshadows the prosperity of Israel in Egypt, as God fulfills His promises to Abraham about his descendants. The prosperity here is both material and spiritual, indicating God's comprehensive blessing.<p><b>in all he did</b><br>This phrase underscores the totality of God's blessing on Joseph's endeavors. It suggests that Joseph's faithfulness and integrity in his work were met with divine favor, aligning with the biblical principle that God rewards those who diligently seek Him (<a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>). This comprehensive success prefigures the ultimate success of Jesus Christ, who perfectly accomplished the Father's will in all He did.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew young man, sold into slavery by his brothers, who becomes a servant in the house of Potiphar, an Egyptian officer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/potiphar.htm">Potiphar</a></b><br>An Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, who purchases Joseph as a slave.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose presence and favor are with Joseph, leading to his success.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph is taken as a slave, representing a place of trial and testing for him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prosperity.htm">Prosperity</a></b><br>The success and blessing that Joseph experiences in all his endeavors, attributed to the LORD's presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god_brings_success.htm">The Presence of God Brings Success</a></b><br>Joseph's prosperity is directly linked to the LORD's presence.
