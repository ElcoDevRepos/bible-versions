Joseph's steward, acting on Joseph's instructions, brings the brothers into the house, which signifies a shift from their previous encounters. This act foreshadows the reconciliation and restoration of relationships that will occur later. The steward's role is crucial, as he acts as an intermediary, much like how Christ serves as a mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>gave them water to wash their feet</b><br>Foot washing was a common practice in biblical times due to the dusty roads and the use of sandals. It was a sign of hospitality and respect, often performed by servants. This act of washing the feet can be seen as a precursor to Jesus washing the disciples' feet in <a href="/john/13.htm">John 13</a>, symbolizing humility and service. It also indicates a level of acceptance and care, contrasting with the brothers' initial fear of being accused of theft.<p><b>and provided food for their donkeys</b><br>Providing food for the donkeys demonstrates a comprehensive hospitality that extends beyond the guests to their animals, reflecting the thoroughness of Joseph's care. In a broader biblical context, this attention to the needs of animals is consistent with the righteous care for all of God's creation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>.
