The number five may symbolize grace or favor in biblical numerology, suggesting divine favor upon Joseph's family. This choice reflects Joseph's wisdom and discernment, as he likely chose those who would make a favorable impression on Pharaoh. The selection of brothers also highlights the theme of family unity and the importance of representation in foreign courts, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern diplomacy.<p><b>and presented them before Pharaoh.</b><br>Joseph's brothers are brought into the presence of Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, signifying a moment of great importance and potential vulnerability. This act of presentation is significant in the cultural context of the time, as it demonstrates Joseph's high standing and trust within the Egyptian court. The brothers' introduction to Pharaoh fulfills Joseph's earlier dreams of his family bowing before him, as seen in <a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7-10</a>, and foreshadows the Israelites' future relationship with Egypt. This encounter also prefigures the eventual Exodus, where the Israelites will again stand before a Pharaoh, but under very different circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who rose to power in Egypt.
