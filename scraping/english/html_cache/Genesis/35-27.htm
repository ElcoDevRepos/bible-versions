After years of estrangement and wandering, Jacob returns to his father, Isaac, signifying a restoration of family ties. This return is also a fulfillment of God's promise to bring Jacob back to the land of his fathers (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). The act of returning to Isaac can be seen as a type of repentance and restoration, themes prevalent throughout Scripture.<p><b>at Mamre</b><br>Mamre is a location with deep patriarchal significance. It is associated with Abraham, who settled there and built an altar to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). The area is known for its large oak trees and is a place where God appeared to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>). Mamre serves as a geographical anchor for the patriarchs, symbolizing God's enduring presence and faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron)</b><br>Kiriath-arba, later known as Hebron, is one of the oldest cities in the region and holds historical and spiritual importance. It is named after Arba, the greatest man among the Anakim (<a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>). Hebron is a city of refuge and a Levitical city, highlighting its role as a place of safety and spiritual leadership. The mention of Hebron connects the narrative to the broader history of Israel, as it becomes a significant city during the reign of King David (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>where Abraham and Isaac had stayed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the continuity of God's covenantal promises through the generations. Abraham and Isaac's residence in this area underscores the land's significance as part of the promised inheritance. It also highlights the faithfulness of God in preserving the patriarchal lineage and the fulfillment of His promises. The mention of both Abraham and Isaac ties Jacob's story to the broader narrative of God's redemptive plan, which ultimately points to Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandson of Abraham.
