In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and agreement. It was customary to seal covenants or agreements with a meal, symbolizing peace and mutual commitment. The act of eating and drinking together signifies the acceptance of the servant's mission and the hospitality extended by Rebekah's family. This hospitality reflects the cultural norms of the time, where travelers were often welcomed and cared for by the host family. The phrase also indicates a time of rest and preparation for the journey ahead, emphasizing the importance of community and relationship in fulfilling God's plans.<p><b>When they got up the next morning, he said, &#8220;Send me on my way to my master.&#8221;</b><br>The servant's request to be sent on his way highlights his dedication and urgency in fulfilling his mission. His loyalty to Abraham and commitment to completing the task reflect the servant's faithfulness and integrity. The phrase "send me on my way" indicates a readiness to continue the journey, underscoring the servant's role as a faithful messenger. This mirrors the biblical theme of obedience and promptness in carrying out God's will, as seen in other scriptural accounts such as the immediate response of the disciples to Jesus' call (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19-20</a>). The servant's desire to return to his master also foreshadows the reunion and fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants. This journey is not just a physical one but also a spiritual journey of faith and trust in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, often identified as Eliezer, is on a mission to find a wife for Isaac, Abraham's son.
