In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, a servant's refusal to obey a master's wife would be seen as insubordination, yet Joseph remains steadfast. This persistence of temptation is reminiscent of the devil's continuous attempts to lead believers astray, as seen in the New Testament with Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>). The daily nature of the temptation underscores the need for constant vigilance and reliance on God's strength to resist sin.<p><b>he refused to go to bed with her</b><br>Joseph's refusal is a testament to his integrity and faithfulness to God. In a society where sexual immorality was prevalent, Joseph's commitment to purity sets him apart. His actions align with the biblical principle of fleeing from sexual immorality (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). Joseph's decision also reflects his understanding of sin as an offense against God, as he later articulates in <a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>. This refusal can be seen as a type of Christ, who remained sinless despite facing temptation.<p><b>or even be near her</b><br>Joseph's decision to avoid even being near Potiphar's wife demonstrates his proactive approach to avoiding sin. This mirrors the biblical advice to avoid the appearance of evil (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>) and to make no provision for the flesh (<a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>). By distancing himself, Joseph exemplifies the wisdom of setting boundaries to maintain righteousness. This action foreshadows the teaching of Jesus, who advises radical measures to avoid sin (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, serving in the house of Potiphar.

Scripture often shows how sin starts with persuasive speech (<a href="/proverbs/7-21.htm">Proverbs 7:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). Joseph had already earned Potiphar&#8217;s trust (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-6</a>), yet this verbal assault tested that trust. Her approach echoes the serpent&#8217;s in Eden&#8212;questioning, enticing, eroding resolve (<a href="/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>). Joseph&#8217;s listening ear could have been a doorway, but he guarded his heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>day after day</b><p>Temptation rarely quits after one attempt; it presses until resistance weakens. Delilah hounded Samson &#8220;daily&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>). The devil left Jesus only &#8220;until an opportune time&#8221; (<a href="/luke/4-13.htm">Luke 4:13</a>). Persistent solicitation sharpened Joseph&#8217;s need for daily vigilance (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). Each fresh advance required a fresh decision to stay faithful.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he refused to go to bed with her</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s &#8220;no&#8221; was decisive. He had already declared the act a &#8220;great wickedness&#8221; against both Potiphar and God (<a href="/genesis/39-9.htm">Genesis 39:9</a>). Sexual purity is never a casual preference; it is a covenant with the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18-20</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>). By refusing, Joseph modeled <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>&#8212;fleeing youthful lusts&#8212;and showed that obedience can cost position or comfort but never costs fellowship with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or even be near her</b><p>Joseph set a physical boundary, recognizing that lingering in the danger zone invites collapse (<a href="/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8</a>; <a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>). Avoiding &#8220;every appearance of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a>) protects integrity and witness. Jesus affirmed this proactive distance when He taught that lust begins in the heart (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>). Joseph understood that the safest way to defeat temptation is to keep it at arm&#8217;s length&#8212;or farther.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-10.htm">Genesis 39:10</a> highlights the relentless nature of temptation and the practical steps Joseph took to remain pure: he guarded his ears, endured repeated pressure without weariness, said a clear &#8220;no,&#8221; and set wise boundaries. His steadfastness proves that God&#8217;s standards are attainable when we choose daily obedience and distance ourselves from anything that would erode our devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as she spake</span> - or, though she spake (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her</span> (a euphemistic expression), <span class="cmt_word">or</span> (which is not in the original, and may be omitted) <span class="cmt_word">to be with her.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Although</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
