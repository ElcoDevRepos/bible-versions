Abram, later known as Abraham, is a central patriarch in the biblical story, and his marriage to Sarai (later Sarah) is significant for the unfolding of God's covenant. Nahor, Abram's brother, also plays a role in the lineage that leads to the nation of Israel. The act of taking wives signifies the continuation of their family lines, which is crucial in the context of God's promises to Abram about his descendants. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, marriage was not only a personal union but also a strategic alliance that ensured the continuation of family heritage and property.<p><b>Abram&#8217;s wife was named Sarai,</b><br>Sarai, later renamed Sarah by God, is a pivotal character in the biblical narrative. Her name, which means "princess," reflects her future role as the matriarch of the Israelite people. Sarai's story is marked by her initial barrenness, which sets the stage for God's miraculous intervention in granting her a son, Isaac, in her old age. This event underscores the theme of divine promise and fulfillment. Sarai's relationship with Abram is also significant in understanding the covenantal promises made by God, as she is directly involved in the lineage through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come.<p><b>and Nahor&#8217;s wife was named Milcah;</b><br>Milcah is an important figure as she connects the family lines of Nahor and Abram. Her marriage to Nahor continues the family lineage that is crucial for the unfolding of biblical history. Milcah's name, meaning "queen" or "counsel," may indicate her esteemed position within the family. The mention of Milcah highlights the interconnectedness of the patriarchal families and sets the stage for future narratives involving their descendants, such as Rebekah, who becomes Isaac's wife.<p><b>she was the daughter of Haran,</b><br>Haran, the father of Milcah, is also the brother of Abram and Nahor, making Milcah both a niece and a sister-in-law to Nahor. This familial connection emphasizes the close-knit nature of the patriarchal family and the importance of maintaining family ties. Haran's early death, mentioned earlier in Genesis, adds a layer of complexity to the family dynamics, as his children, including Milcah, are integrated into the broader narrative of God's plan for Abram's descendants.<p><b>who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah.</b><br>The mention of Iscah, alongside Milcah, is intriguing, as Iscah is not further elaborated upon in the biblical text. Some Jewish traditions suggest that Iscah may be another name for Sarai, though this is not explicitly stated in the Bible. The inclusion of Iscah in the genealogy underscores the importance of family lineage and the preservation of heritage. The genealogical details provided here serve to connect the patriarchal narratives and highlight the divine orchestration of events leading to the fulfillment of God's promises to Abram and his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, called by God to be the father of many nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahor.htm">Nahor</a></b><br>Abram's brother, who also took a wife, Milcah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarai.htm">Sarai</a></b><br>Abram's wife, later known as Sarah, who plays a significant role in the unfolding of God's covenant.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/milcah.htm">Milcah</a></b><br>Nahor's wife, who is also the daughter of Haran, making her both Nahor's niece and sister-in-law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>The father of Milcah and Iscah, and brother to Abram and Nahor.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_family_and_lineage.htm">The Importance of Family and Lineage</a></b><br>The genealogies and family connections in Genesis highlight the importance of family in God's plan.

Nor was she Lot's wife, as Ewald supposed, for she was his full sister. Marriages between near relatives seem to have been allowed at this time, and were perhaps even common for religious reasons (see <a href="/context/genesis/24-3.htm" title="And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:">Genesis 24:3-4</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/28-1.htm" title="And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said to him, You shall not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.">Genesis 28:1-2</a>), but not marriages between those actually by the same mother. Thus Abraham takes his half-sister to wife, and Nahor his niece. Iscah, like Naamah (<a href="/genesis/4-22.htm" title="And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.">Genesis 4:22</a>), was probably eminent in her time, but for reasons not recorded.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abram and Nahor took them wives</span> (cf.
