This place is later identified as Bethel, a significant site in biblical history. Bethel, meaning "House of God," becomes a central location for worship and divine encounters. The anonymity of the place at first highlights the unexpected nature of divine encounters, suggesting that God can reveal Himself anywhere. This reflects the theme of God's omnipresence and His ability to transform ordinary places into sacred spaces.<p><b>he spent the night there because the sun had set</b><br>The setting of the sun signifies the end of a day's journey and the need for rest. In biblical times, travel was often dictated by the natural light of day, as nighttime travel was perilous. The setting sun also symbolizes a transition, both physically and spiritually, as Jacob is about to experience a significant divine revelation. This moment foreshadows the darkness of Jacob's current situation, fleeing from Esau, and the forthcoming light of God's promise and presence.<p><b>And taking one of the stones from that place</b><br>The stone Jacob selects is not just a practical object for comfort but becomes a symbol of the divine encounter he is about to have. Stones in biblical narratives often serve as memorials or altars, marking significant events or covenants with God. This particular stone later becomes a pillar, anointed by Jacob, signifying the sacredness of the encounter. The use of a stone also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as a "rock" or foundation, symbolizing strength and stability.<p><b>he put it under his head</b><br>Using a stone as a pillow highlights the harshness of Jacob's circumstances. It reflects his vulnerability and the discomfort of his journey, both physically and spiritually. This act of using a stone for a pillow can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and hardships Jacob faces. Despite the discomfort, it is in this state of vulnerability that Jacob receives a profound revelation from God, illustrating how divine encounters often occur in moments of weakness or need.<p><b>and lay down to sleep</b><br>Jacob's sleep sets the stage for a divine dream, a common medium for God's communication in the Bible. Sleep represents a state of rest and vulnerability, where human defenses are lowered, allowing for divine intervention. This moment of rest is pivotal, as it transitions Jacob from a state of fear and uncertainty to one of assurance and promise through the dream of the ladder. Sleep, in this context, becomes a conduit for divine revelation, emphasizing God's initiative in reaching out to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is on a journey to Haran to find a wife from his mother's family.

Human limits become the doorway to divine encounter, setting the stage for the transformative vision that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">He lighted upon a certain place.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">he lighted upon the place. </span>The article probably signifies that it was the place appointed for the revelation, though lighted upon by Jacob by chance. As it lay twelve miles north of Jerusalem, in the mountains of Ephraim, Jacob had already been at least four days on the route (see Note on <a href="/genesis/22-4.htm" title="Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.">Genesis 22:4</a>); and though we are not to suppose that Isaac would send away the son who was heir of the blessing without a few trusty servants (nor does the expression in <a href="/genesis/32-10.htm" title="I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which you have showed to your servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.">Genesis 32:10</a> require it), yet Jacob would none the less feel the solemnity of the journey, and the difficulties which surrounded him. Well may he have asked whether <span class= "ital">El Shaddai </span>would confirm him in the possession of that which he had defiled by fraud and cunning. And thus, meditating much and praying much, he had in those four days drawn near to God, and is at last accepted. The interest in Jacob's life lies in the gradual improvement and progress of his character. Religion was always a reality with him; but at first it was of a low type, and marred by duplicity and earthly scheming. His schemes succeed, but bring with them sorrow and trial; and trial purifies him, and gradually he advances into a region of unselfish and holy piety. Though to the last he was a man sagacious, and full of expedients, yet the nobler part of his character finally had the supremacy.<p><span class= "bld">He took of the stones. . . . --</span>Heb., <span class= "ital">he took one of the stones of the place, and put it as his bolster. </span>Jewish commentators identify the place with Mount Moriah, and say that the stone which Jacob placed under his head was one of those which had formed the altar upon which Isaac had been bound for sacrifice. The name Beth-el signified, they add, the temple, and as <span class= "ital">makom</span>--place--is thrice used in this verse, it mysteriously foreshadowed the three temples--Solomon's, Ze-rubbabel's, and Herod's--which successively occupied the site. More probably Beth-el was really the town of that name, and these explanations are allegorical rather than expository.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he lighted upon a certain place</span>, - literally, he <span class="accented">struck upon the place</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either the place best suited for him to rest in (Inglis), or the place appointed for him by God (Ainsworth, Bush), or more probably the well-known place afterwards mentioned (Keil, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary').
