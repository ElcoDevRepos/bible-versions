Arphaxad is a descendant of Noah through Shem, highlighting the fulfillment of God's promise to preserve humanity through Noah's family after the flood. The mention of Shelah connects to the lineage that eventually leads to Abraham, emphasizing the importance of this family line in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan. The genealogies in Genesis serve to trace the ancestry of the Israelites and establish the historical context for the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people.<p><b>Arphaxad lived 403 years</b><br>The long lifespan of Arphaxad, as recorded here, is consistent with the ages of other patriarchs in the early chapters of Genesis. These extended lifespans are often interpreted as a sign of the vitality and blessing of the pre-flood and immediate post-flood generations. The decrease in lifespans over subsequent generations is sometimes seen as a reflection of the increasing effects of sin in the world. Arphaxad's life, spanning over four centuries, underscores the continuity and stability of the early post-flood world, as well as the faithfulness of God in preserving His people through successive generations.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Arphaxad, like many of the patriarchs, had a larger family beyond the specifically named descendants. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the growth and expansion of human populations after the flood, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). While the biblical narrative focuses on the line leading to Abraham, the existence of other descendants highlights the broader context of human history and the spread of different peoples and nations. This also reflects the biblical theme of God's providence in working through both named and unnamed individuals to accomplish His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peleg.htm">Peleg</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, Peleg is noted in the genealogies of Genesis as an ancestor of Abraham.

This keeps the post-Flood genealogy flowing from Shem toward Abraham, showing God&#8217;s faithful preservation of the promised line first hinted at in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> and traced all the way to Jesus in <a href="/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35-36</a>.<p>&#8226; Each &#8220;father of&#8221; phrase in <a href="/bsb/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a> is literal history, underscoring that redemption&#8217;s story is rooted in real families, not myths.<p>&#8226; By spotlighting one particular son before mentioning &#8220;other sons and daughters,&#8221; Scripture stresses the messianic thread without denying the breadth of humanity&#8217;s spread (compare <a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3-4</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Arphaxad lived 403 years</b><p>&#8226; These centuries are counted just as straightforwardly as Noah&#8217;s 950 years (<a href="/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29</a>) or Shem&#8217;s 600 (<a href="/genesis/11-11.htm">Genesis 11:11</a>). Post-Flood longevity is declining, yet 403 more years still grant Arphaxad time to watch several generations grow.<p>&#8226; Long life in this era serves God&#8217;s command to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>), filling the earth quickly after the Flood.<p>&#8226; The steady shortening of lifespans, visible when Isaac lives 180 years (<a href="/genesis/35-28.htm">Genesis 35:28</a>) and Moses remarks on &#8220;seventy, or if by strength eighty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>), illustrates God&#8217;s progressive movement toward the 120-year ceiling announced in <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a> while still displaying His patience with humanity (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; The phrase assures us that the genealogy is selective, not exhaustive; Shelah is named for theological focus, but Arphaxad&#8217;s household was large. This mirrors Adam&#8217;s pattern in <a href="/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4</a> and emphasizes that every family contributes to the one blood of mankind (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s blessing of children is constant from Eden onward (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>). Each unnamed child carried the image of God, spreading communities, cultures, and languages that will soon be highlighted at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; By noting both the honored line and the broader family, Scripture balances particular grace (the messianic line) with common grace (all peoples).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-13.htm">Genesis 11:13</a> affirms that after the Flood, God preserved a literal, traceable line from Shem through Arphaxad to Shelah, while also filling the earth through many other children. Arphaxad&#8217;s 403 post-Shelah years reveal both God&#8217;s blessing of longevity for early humanity and the gradual shortening of life toward present norms. The verse quietly but powerfully declares God&#8217;s faithfulness in history, His commitment to populate the world, and His focus on the lineage that will ultimately bring forth the Savior.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had become the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124;
