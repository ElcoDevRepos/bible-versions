This reflects the cultural importance of hospitality and concern for others' welfare in ancient Near Eastern societies. The Hebrew word for "well" here is "shalom," which encompasses peace, health, and completeness. Joseph's inquiry is significant as it shows his continued care for his family despite their past betrayal. This moment also foreshadows the reconciliation and restoration of relationships, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>and then he asked, &#8220;How is your elderly father you told me about?</b><br>Joseph's question about their father, Jacob, highlights the importance of family lineage and respect for elders in biblical times. Jacob, also known as Israel, is a patriarch whose life and experiences are foundational to the Israelite identity. This inquiry is not just about Jacob's physical health but also about the continuity of God's covenant promises through him. Joseph's concern for his father reflects the biblical principle of honoring one's parents, as seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p><b>Is he still alive?&#8221;</b><br>The question of Jacob's survival is poignant, considering the years of separation and the uncertainty surrounding his well-being. This reflects the broader biblical theme of life and death, and the preservation of God's chosen people. Joseph's inquiry can be seen as a type of Christ, who is deeply concerned with the life and spiritual well-being of His people. The survival of Jacob is crucial for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, as it ensures the continuation of the lineage through which the Messiah would eventually come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is actually the brother of the men he is questioning.
