It reflects the ongoing covenant relationship between God and the patriarchs, as seen in previous interactions with Abraham and Isaac. God's guidance is a recurring theme, highlighting His sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>Arise, go up to Bethel</b><br>"Arise" suggests urgency and action. Bethel, meaning "House of God," is significant in Jacob's life. It is where he previously encountered God in a dream (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>). The phrase "go up" indicates Bethel's higher elevation geographically. Bethel is a place of spiritual significance, marking a return to a site of divine revelation and promise.<p><b>and settle there</b><br>This command to settle implies a period of stability and permanence, contrasting with Jacob's previous transient lifestyle. It signifies a new chapter in Jacob's life, where he is to establish his household in a place of spiritual importance. This settling is part of God's plan for Jacob's lineage and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>Build an altar there</b><br>Building an altar is an act of worship and obedience, signifying reverence and dedication to God. Altars in the Old Testament are places of sacrifice, prayer, and covenant renewal. This command connects to the patriarchal tradition of altar-building as seen with Abraham and Isaac, symbolizing a tangible commitment to God.<p><b>to the God who appeared to you</b><br>This phrase recalls Jacob's previous encounter with God at Bethel, reinforcing the personal and relational aspect of God's covenant. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the promises made to Jacob. The appearance of God to Jacob is a theophany, a divine manifestation that underscores God's presence and guidance.<p><b>when you fled from your brother Esau</b><br>This reference to Jacob's flight from Esau highlights God's protection and provision during a time of fear and uncertainty. It serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and the transformation in Jacob's life since that time.

It was necessary, therefore, to remove; but besides this, Beth-el was the goal of the patriarch's jonrneyings. He had made a solemn vow there on his journey to Padanaram, and though forty-two years had elapsed, it had not been forgotten (see <a href="/genesis/31-13.htm" title="I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you vowed a vow to me: now arise, get you out from this land, and return to the land of your kindred.">Genesis 31:13</a>); and the Divine command to go thither Was the outward authorisation of what his own conscience dictated. On this account we cannot believe that he had remained long at Shechem. Nomads are singularly leisurely in their movements. There is nothing of the rush and hurry of city life in their doings or purposes. They are capable of a great effort occasionally, but then relapse into their usual slowness. And so, when Jacob found good pasture and plenty of room for his cattle at Shechem, he remained there for awhile; but he did not abandon his purpose of going first <span class= "ital">to </span>Beth-el, and finally to Hebron.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God</span> - Elohim. The employment of this name for the Deity throughout the present chapter has been deemed conclusive evidence that, with Rome Jehovistic alterations, it belongs to the fundamental document (Tuch, Bleek, Delitzsch, Kalisch, <span class="accented">et alii</span>); but the frequent allusions to <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-16</a>, which by partitionists is almost universally assigned to the Jehovist, prove that both sections have proceeded from the same author, and that, "though the mention of the name is avoided, this chapter, there is no doubt, substantially relates to Jehovah" (Hengstenberg), while the name Elohim may simply indicate that Jacob s journey from Shechem was undertaken in obedience to a Divine intimation (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">said unto Jacob</span> (shortly after the incidents recorded in the preceding chapter), <span class="cmt_word">Arise, go up to Bethel</span>, - about thirty miles distant (<a href="/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>; <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), to which, some thirty years previous, he had solemnly vowed to return (<a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>) - a vow which he appeared somewhat dilatory in performing, although its conditions had been exactly fulfilled (Keil, Kurtz, Kalisch, etc.) - <span class="cmt_word">and dwell there</span> (the massacre of the Shechemites had obviously rendered longer residence in that neighborhood unsafe): <span class="cmt_word">and make there an altar</span> - this Jacob had substantially promised to do in his vow (vide <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto God, that appeared unto thee</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unto Jehovah (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 28:13) - <span class="cmt_word">when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother</span>.
