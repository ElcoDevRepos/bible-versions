The act of returning Sarah to Abraham is a restoration of divine order, reflecting the importance of marital fidelity. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, marriage was a covenantal relationship, and taking another man's wife was a serious offense. This directive also highlights God's protection over His covenant people, ensuring that His promises to Abraham would not be compromised.<p><b>for he is a prophet</b><br>This is the first time in the Bible that someone is explicitly called a prophet. Abraham's role as a prophet indicates his unique relationship with God, serving as an intermediary who receives divine revelation. Prophets in the biblical narrative often serve as God's mouthpieces, delivering His messages to others. This designation also foreshadows the prophetic tradition that will be central to Israel's history, with figures like Moses, Elijah, and Isaiah. Abraham's prophetic role is significant in that it establishes a precedent for the function and authority of prophets in guiding God's people.<p><b>he will pray for you</b><br>Intercessory prayer is a powerful theme in Scripture, and here Abraham is called to intercede on behalf of Abimelech. This act of prayer demonstrates the power of righteous intercession, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Moses praying for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Job praying for his friends (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>). It also highlights the grace and mercy of God, who is willing to forgive and restore those who seek Him. Abraham's prayer is a type of Christ's intercessory work, as Jesus is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>and you will live</b><br>The promise of life is contingent upon obedience to God's command. This reflects the biblical principle that obedience to God leads to life and blessing, while disobedience leads to death and curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>). In the immediate context, Abimelech's life and the lives of his household are spared through compliance with God's directive. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical narrative of salvation, where life is offered through faith and obedience to God's word.<p><b>But if you do not restore her</b><br>This conditional statement emphasizes human responsibility and the consequences of disobedience. The choice presented to Abimelech mirrors the choices given to individuals throughout Scripture, where obedience to God results in blessing, and disobedience results in judgment. It serves as a warning that God's commands are not to be taken lightly, and that there are serious repercussions for failing to adhere to His will.<p><b>be aware that you will surely die</b><br>The certainty of death as a consequence for disobedience is a recurring theme in the Bible, beginning with the warning given to Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>. This phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and the justice of God. It also foreshadows the ultimate penalty for sin, which is spiritual death, as articulated in <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. The warning to Abimelech serves as a reminder of the holiness of God and the need for repentance and restoration.<p><b>you and all who belong to you</b><br>The communal aspect of this warning highlights the interconnectedness of individuals within a community. In the ancient world, the actions of a leader often had repercussions for the entire household or nation. This principle is seen in other biblical accounts, such as Achan's sin affecting all of Israel (Joshua 7) and David's census leading to a plague on the people (2 Samuel 24). It underscores the biblical teaching that sin has far-reaching consequences, affecting not just the individual but also those around them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>A patriarch and prophet, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

There was a true feeling that God in His own nature is beyond the reach of man (<a href="/context/job/9-32.htm" title="For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.">Job 9:32-33</a>; <a href="/job/16-21.htm" title="O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!">Job 16:21</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1Timothy 6:16</a>); and this in heathen nations led to men peopling their heavens with a multitude of minor deities. In Israel, after the founding of the prophetic schools by Samuel, the prophets became an order, whose office it was partly to enliven the services of the Temple with sacred minstrelsy (<a href="/1_chronicles/25-1.htm" title="Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was:">1Chronicles 25:1</a>), but chiefly to be God's spokesmen, both declaring His will to Jew and Gentile ( <a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm" title="Before I formed you in the belly I knew you; and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you, and I ordained you a prophet to the nations.">Jeremiah 1:5</a>), and also maintaining religion and holiness by earnest preaching and other such means. In this way they were forerunners, and even representatives, of Christ, who is the one true and only Mediator between God and man. Not only Abraham, therefore, but the patriarchs generally are called "Christs and prophets (<a href="/psalms/105-15.htm" title="Saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.">Psalm 105:15</a>), as being speakers for God to man, and for man to God, until the true Christ and prophet came. Abimelech, moreover, is thus taught that he does not himself hold a near relation to God, but requires some one to speak for him; perhaps, too, he would gather from it that he had need of fuller instruction, and that he ought to try to attain to a higher level, and that Abraham would become a prophet to him in its other sense of being a teacher. (For the prophet as an intercessor, see <a href="/context/exodus/8-28.htm" title="And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.">Exodus 8:28-29</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/9-19.htm" title="For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you.

The office of the Nabi was twofold - to announce the will of God to melt <a href="/exodus/4-15.htm">Exodus 4:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>), and also to intercede with God for men (Ver. 7; <a href="/jeremiah/7-16.htm">Jeremiah 7:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-14.htm">Jeremiah 11:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/14-11.htm">Jeremiah 14:11</a>). The use of the term Nabi in this place neither proves that the spirit of prophecy had not existed from the beginning (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25-27</a>), nor shows that the Pentateuch, which always uses this term, cannot be of greater antiquity than the time of Samuel, before which, according to <a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, the prophet was called a seer (Bohlen, Hartmann).
