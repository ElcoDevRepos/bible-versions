This moment occurs after he has left Laban and is preparing to meet his brother Esau, whom he had wronged years earlier. The night represents a time of reflection and preparation for the impending encounter. In biblical narratives, nighttime often symbolizes a period of waiting or divine encounter, as seen in Jacob's later wrestling with God (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-32</a>).<p><b>and from what he had brought with him</b><br>Jacob had amassed considerable wealth during his time with Laban, including livestock and servants. This wealth was a sign of God's blessing and fulfillment of His promise to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). The possessions Jacob brought with him were not only material wealth but also a testament to God's faithfulness and provision. This wealth would play a crucial role in his strategy to appease Esau.<p><b>he selected a gift for his brother Esau</b><br>The act of selecting a gift for Esau is deeply rooted in the cultural practices of the time. Offering gifts was a common way to seek reconciliation and show respect or submission. Jacob's choice to send a gift ahead of their meeting was a strategic move to pacify Esau's anger and demonstrate his goodwill. This act of sending gifts can be seen as a precursor to the peace offerings described in Levitical law (Leviticus 3). Additionally, it reflects the biblical principle of making amends and seeking peace with others, as echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>. Jacob's actions also foreshadow the ultimate reconciliation and peace brought by Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate gift of reconciliation between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

Stopping for the night reflects deliberate dependence on the Lord rather than frantic self-reliance, echoing his earlier experience at Bethel when he rested and God met him in a dream (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Resting in the midst of crisis mirrors the confidence voiced later in <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety,&#8221; and anticipates the trust Jesus displays when He prays through the night before the cross (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-46</a>).<p>&#8226; The quiet night becomes a space for reflection and prayer, as seen in Jacob&#8217;s plea just a few verses earlier (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9-12</a>). Before any strategy, he waits on God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From what he had brought with him</b><p>&#8226; Jacob possesses substantial wealth&#8212;flocks, herds, servants&#8212;gained under God&#8217;s blessing in Paddan-aram (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>; 31:17-18). Instead of clinging to it, he recognizes that &#8220;every good and perfect gift is from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; His willingness to part with a portion of his assets models <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>, &#8220;Honor the LORD with your wealth,&#8221; and foreshadows New-Testament generosity where believers freely give from what God supplies (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By selecting from his own possessions rather than borrowing or imposing on others, Jacob takes personal responsibility for seeking reconciliation, reminiscent of the restitution principle later codified in <a href="/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He selected a gift for his brother Esau</b><p>&#8226; The gift (later detailed in <a href="/genesis/32-14.htm">Genesis 32:14-15</a>) serves as a tangible olive branch, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>, &#8220;A gift opens the way and ushers the giver into the presence of the great.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s action embodies repentance and humility; years earlier he had wronged Esau (<a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>). Now he moves toward making peace, paralleling Jesus&#8217; teaching to &#8220;be reconciled to your brother&#8221; before offering worship (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar peace offerings appear when Abigail averts David&#8217;s wrath with provisions (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-27</a>) and when Jacob later says, &#8220;To see your face is like seeing the face of God&#8221; after Esau accepts the gift (<a href="/genesis/33-10.htm">Genesis 33:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The voluntary nature of the gift underlines that grace motivates reconciliation: Jacob does not bribe Esau but expresses goodwill born of God&#8217;s prior grace to him (<a href="/genesis/32-10.htm">Genesis 32:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a> captures a decisive moment of faith-filled humility. Jacob halts for the night, trusts God while planning, draws from the very blessings God has given, and intentionally crafts a gift to mend a broken relationship. The verse teaches that genuine reconciliation flows from resting in God, recognizing His provision, and offering costly, heartfelt peace to those we have wronged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He lodged there.</span>--That is, at Mahanaim. On the first news of Esau's approach in so hostile a manner, Jacob had divided his possessions into two main divisions, in the hope of saving at least one. He now, quieted by his prayer, makes more exact arrangements, selects a present for Esau of five hundred and fifty head of cattle, sends them forward with intervals between, that repeated impressions might soften his brother's fierce mood, sees all his followers safely across the Jabbok, and remains alone behind to pray. As he thus placed everything in Esau's power, faith seems to have regained the ascendancy over his fears, though he still takes every prudent measure for the safety of those whom he loved.<p><span class= "bld">Of that which came to his hand.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">of that which came in his hand. </span>Some Jewish interpreters take the phrase literally, and suppose that it was precious stones; more truly it means "what he possessed," or what he had with him.
