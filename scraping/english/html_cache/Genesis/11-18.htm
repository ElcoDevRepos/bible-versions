The age of 30 is notable in biblical narratives as it often marks the beginning of significant life events or ministries, such as Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>) and Jesus beginning His public ministry (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). This age may symbolize maturity and readiness for responsibility.<p><b>he became the father of Reu</b><br>Reu is part of the genealogical line leading to Abraham, which is crucial for understanding the lineage through which God would establish His covenant people, Israel. This genealogy underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Noah to preserve humanity and highlights the continuity of God's plan through specific family lines. The name Reu means "friend" or "shepherd," which may reflect the pastoral culture of the time. This lineage is also significant in the broader biblical narrative as it eventually leads to the birth of Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecies and God's redemptive plan for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peleg.htm">Peleg</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, Peleg is noted in the genealogies of Genesis as an ancestor of Abraham.

Peleg&#8217;s &#8220;30&#8221; is not symbolic; it is a precise marker in the post-Flood timeline (cf. <a href="/genesis/11-16.htm">Genesis 11:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; The age highlights God&#8217;s orderly plan. Earlier patriarchs often fathered children at much higher ages, but after the Flood lifespans and childbearing ages steadily decline, showing a new rhythm for humanity (compare <a href="/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; 11:10&#8211;12).<p>&#8226; Thirty frequently marks readiness for service or responsibility in Scripture&#8212;Joseph stepped into leadership at 30 (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), David began his reign at 30 (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>), and Jesus began His public ministry &#8220;about thirty&#8221; (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). Peleg&#8217;s fatherhood at 30 fits this biblical pattern of maturity.<p>&#8226; Historically, this verse situates us between Babel&#8217;s dispersion (<a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>) and God&#8217;s call of Abram (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>), reminding us that God preserves a faithful line even amid global upheaval.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he became the father of Reu</b><p>&#8226; Genealogies announce God&#8217;s covenant thread. Reu is one more vital link on the way from Shem to Abram and, ultimately, to Messiah (<a href="/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35-36</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Father&#8221; underscores both biological descent and covenant responsibility. In raising Reu, Peleg helps steward the promises first given to Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>) and later amplified to Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>) and soon to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse affirms the continuity of God&#8217;s redemptive plan: every generation matters, every name kept in Scripture is purposeful (cf. <a href="/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14-25</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-17.htm">1 Chronicles 1:17-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Reu himself will father Serug at 32 (<a href="/genesis/11-20.htm">Genesis 11:20</a>), showing a continued shortening of generations yet an unbroken lineage, demonstrating God&#8217;s faithful preservation of the promised Seed (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-18.htm">Genesis 11:18</a> records a literal moment in history: when Peleg, now fully mature at 30, fathered Reu.
