In biblical narratives, early morning often signifies a time of important activity or divine encounter (e.g., <a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>, <a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>). It reflects Abimelech's immediate response to God's warning in a dream, showing his fear of God and desire to rectify the situation quickly.<p><b>Abimelech got up</b><br>Abimelech, a Philistine king, is portrayed as a man of action. His rising early signifies his leadership and responsibility. In the ancient Near East, kings were expected to act decisively, especially in matters involving divine intervention. This action underscores his role as a ruler who takes divine warnings seriously.<p><b>and summoned all his servants</b><br>The summoning of his servants indicates the gravity of the situation. In ancient cultures, a king's servants would include his advisors and officials, suggesting that Abimelech sought counsel and transparency. This collective involvement highlights the communal aspect of leadership and the importance of addressing potential divine wrath.<p><b>and when he described to them all that had happened</b><br>Abimelech's transparency in recounting the dream to his servants shows his integrity and fear of God. It also reflects the cultural practice of sharing divine revelations with trusted advisors for interpretation and action. This openness is crucial for maintaining trust and unity within his court.<p><b>the men were terrified</b><br>The fear of Abimelech's men underscores the seriousness of the divine warning. In the ancient world, dreams were often seen as messages from the gods, and a threat from the God of Abraham would have been particularly alarming. This reaction highlights the recognition of God's power and the potential consequences of disobedience, echoing the fear of God seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-20</a>, <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The king of Gerar, who unknowingly took Sarah, Abraham's wife, into his household, believing she was Abraham's sister.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who, out of fear for his life, misled Abimelech by claiming Sarah was his sister.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>Abraham's wife, who was taken by Abimelech due to Abraham's deception.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gerar.htm">Gerar</a></b><br>The region where Abimelech ruled and where this event took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_warning.htm">God's Warning</a></b><br>God appeared to Abimelech in a dream, warning him of the truth about Sarah and the consequences of keeping her.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_fear_and_deception.htm">The Consequences of Fear and Deception</a></b><br>Abraham's fear led to deception, which almost brought disaster upon Abimelech and his household.

The narrative thus turns expectations: pagans fear God more than the patriarch feared God&#8217;s ability to protect him.<p>&#8226; Holy dread prepares hearts for decisive, corrective action (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).
