The mention of Canaan here foreshadows the curse that Noah will pronounce on Canaan in <a href="/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>. This connection is crucial for understanding the historical enmity between the Israelites and the Canaanites. The genealogical link also highlights the importance of lineage and inheritance in biblical narratives.<p><b>saw his father&#8217;s nakedness</b><br>The act of seeing Noah's nakedness is often interpreted as a sign of disrespect and dishonor. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, nakedness was associated with shame and vulnerability. This incident reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the loss of innocence, reminiscent of Adam and Eve's realization of their nakedness in <a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>. The phrase may also imply a deeper moral failing or breach of family honor, which is why it results in a curse.<p><b>and told his two brothers outside.</b><br>Ham's decision to tell his brothers rather than covering his father himself is seen as an act of further disrespect. This action contrasts with the respectful behavior of Shem and Japheth, who cover their father without looking at him. The narrative emphasizes the importance of honoring one's parents, a theme that is later codified in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). The brothers' response also prefigures the biblical principle of love covering a multitude of sins (<a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>), highlighting the virtue of discretion and respect within family relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/ham.htm">Ham</a></b><br>The second son of Noah, who is noted for seeing his father's nakedness and telling his brothers.

While Noah had walked faithfully (<a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>), each son must choose obedience for himself.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights the moral decisions of specific people&#8212;Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>), Lot&#8217;s wife (<a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>), Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>)&#8212;to warn believers that family legacy cannot substitute for personal righteousness (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Ham&#8217;s choice contrasts with Shem and Japheth&#8217;s later honor, illustrating the recurring biblical theme of a divided household (<a href="/matthew/10-35.htm">Matthew 10:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the father of Canaan</b><p>&#8226; The narrator links Ham with Canaan to prepare for the curse in <a href="/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>. Actions of parents affect descendants (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>), yet each generation is still accountable (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention establishes the origin of future conflict between Israel and the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>). God&#8217;s sovereignty weaves history from early patriarchal events to later national narratives (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saw his father&#8217;s nakedness</b><p>&#8226; Noah&#8217;s uncovered state (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>) was a moment of vulnerability. Rather than shielding his eyes, Ham gazed and lingered. Scripture warns against delighting in another&#8217;s shame (<a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Nakedness after the Fall often represents disgrace (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7-11</a>). Covering sin lovingly&#8212;when appropriate&#8212;reflects God&#8217;s own gracious covering (<a href="/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>). Ham&#8217;s failure shows a heart unmoved by godly compassion.<p>&#8226; The verse does not suggest an immoral act beyond voyeurism; the text explicitly states he &#8220;saw.&#8221; The sin lies in disrespect, not in an illicit physical act. <a href="/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7</a> later forbids uncovering a father&#8217;s nakedness, reinforcing the seriousness of Ham&#8217;s irreverence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told his two brothers outside</b><p>&#8226; Spreading the news compounds the offense. Scripture equates talebearing with sin (<a href="/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>; <a href="/james/4-11.htm">James 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of restoring a brother gently (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>), Ham publicized Noah&#8217;s humiliation, displaying mockery rather than mercy.<p>&#8226; His brothers model the right response: they walk backward, eyes averted, and cover Noah (<a href="/genesis/9-23.htm">Genesis 9:23</a>). This contrast highlights the biblical call to honor parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>) and to protect the dignity of others (<a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a> records Ham&#8217;s disrespectful choice to gaze upon and broadcast his father Noah&#8217;s nakedness. The verse warns against delighting in another&#8217;s shame, underscores parental honor, and foreshadows the Canaanite curse. Believers are prompted to respond to others&#8217; failures with discretion, compassion, and protective love, mirroring Shem and Japheth&#8212;and ultimately reflecting God&#8217;s own covering grace through Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22, 23) <span class= "bld">Ham </span>. . . <span class= "bld">saw </span>. . . <span class= "bld">and told.</span>--The sin lay not in seeing, which might be unintentional, but in telling, especially if his purpose was to ridicule his father.
