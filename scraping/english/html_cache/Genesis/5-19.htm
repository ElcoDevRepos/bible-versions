Enoch is notable for his close relationship with God, as later verses describe him as one who "walked with God." This sets a precedent for the importance of faith and righteousness in the biblical narrative. The genealogical record in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> serves to connect the antediluvian patriarchs, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan through successive generations. Enoch's lineage is significant as it eventually leads to Noah, a type of Christ in his role as a savior of humanity through the ark.<p><b>Jared lived 800 years</b><br>The mention of Jared's lifespan reflects the extraordinary longevity of the antediluvian patriarchs, a common feature in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>. This longevity is often interpreted as a sign of the original vitality of humanity before the effects of sin and the Flood. The long lifespans also serve to bridge the gap between Adam and Noah, maintaining the continuity of the human race and the transmission of divine knowledge and tradition. The number 800, while not directly symbolic, contributes to the overall pattern of long lives in this genealogical record.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jared, like other patriarchs, had a large family. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the growth and expansion of the human population during this period. It also implies that the genealogical records in Genesis focus on specific lines of descent, particularly those leading to significant figures like Noah. The emphasis on family and progeny underscores the biblical theme of God's blessing through multiplication and the fulfillment of His command to "be fruitful and multiply." This phrase also highlights the importance of family lineage in the biblical narrative, which is crucial for understanding the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jared.htm">Jared</a></b><br>A patriarch in the genealogy from Adam to Noah.

In a world not yet marred by post-Flood environmental changes, human physiology permitted such longevity (<a href="/genesis/5-7.htm">Genesis 5:7, 11, 23</a>).<p>&#8226; Long life was a platform for extended influence&#8212;years in which Jared could labor, worship, and convey God&#8217;s ways to multiple generations, echoing <a href="/psalms/128-6.htm">Psalm 128:6</a>, &#8220;May you live to see your children&#8217;s children.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The length of Jared&#8217;s life also testifies to God&#8217;s patience. Even as human wickedness would soon escalate (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>), the Lord allowed centuries for people to seek Him (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Each recorded life span reminds us that, no matter how many years we are given&#8212;whether 80 (<a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>) or 800&#8212;our days are numbered by God and should be invested wisely (<a href="/ephesians/5-15.htm">Ephesians 5:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; Jared&#8217;s family did not stop with Enoch.
