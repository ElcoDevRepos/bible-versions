In the ancient Near Eastern context, livestock was a primary measure of wealth and prosperity. Jacob's actions reflect a deep understanding of animal husbandry, which was crucial for survival and economic success. This also demonstrates Jacob's wisdom and resourcefulness, traits that are consistent with his character throughout Genesis.<p><b>Jacob would place the branches in the troughs</b><br>Jacob's use of branches is a continuation of the earlier narrative where he peels the bark to create visual stimuli for the animals. This practice, while not scientifically supported today, reflects the ancient belief in sympathetic magic, where visual or physical stimuli were thought to influence outcomes. It underscores Jacob's reliance on both divine favor and human ingenuity to prosper.<p><b>in full view of the animals</b><br>The placement of the branches in full view suggests an intentional act to influence the breeding process. This action can be seen as a symbolic gesture of faith, trusting that God would bless his efforts. It also reflects the importance of visibility and perception in ancient practices, where what was seen was believed to have power.<p><b>so that they would breed in front of the branches</b><br>This phrase indicates the desired outcome of Jacob's actions. The breeding in front of the branches was meant to produce offspring that were speckled or spotted, aligning with the agreement between Jacob and Laban. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence and blessing upon Jacob, despite the deceptive practices of Laban. It also foreshadows the eventual growth and prosperity of Jacob's descendants, fulfilling God's promises to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

In this passage, he is tending Laban's flocks and using selective breeding techniques to increase his own wealth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Jacob's uncle and father-in-law, who has employed Jacob to tend his flocks. Laban is often depicted as shrewd and self-serving, which sets the stage for Jacob's own strategic actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flocks.htm">The Flocks</a></b><br>The animals under Jacob's care, which are central to the account as they represent both wealth and God's blessing.
