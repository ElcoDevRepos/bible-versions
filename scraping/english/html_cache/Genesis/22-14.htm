The name "The LORD Will Provide" (Yahweh Yireh) reflects Abraham's recognition of God's provision, as God provided a ram as a substitute for Isaac. This event is a foreshadowing of God's ultimate provision through Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The act of naming the place signifies a memorial of God's faithfulness and a testament to His character as a provider. This location, Mount Moriah, is traditionally associated with the future site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, further linking it to God's provision and presence.<p><b>So to this day it is said,</b><br>This phrase indicates that the saying became a lasting tradition or proverb among the Israelites. It suggests that the story of God's provision on Mount Moriah was passed down through generations, reinforcing the faith of the people and reminding them of God's reliability. The phrase "to this day" implies that the narrative held continued relevance and was a source of encouragement and teaching for the community.<p><b>&#8220;On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.&#8221;</b><br>This statement encapsulates the belief that God's provision is not limited to the past but is an ongoing reality. The "mountain of the LORD" refers to a place of divine encounter and revelation. In the broader biblical narrative, mountains are often sites of significant spiritual events, such as the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai and the Transfiguration of Jesus on a high mountain. The future tense "will be provided" points to the anticipation of God's continued faithfulness and provision, ultimately fulfilled in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, which took place in the vicinity of Jerusalem, near the traditional location of Mount Moriah. This phrase underscores the theme of God's provision throughout the biblical story and invites believers to trust in His ongoing care and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who demonstrated his faith and obedience to God by being willing to sacrifice his son Isaac.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>Abraham's son, who was the intended sacrifice, representing the promise of God to Abraham.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, who intervenes to provide a ram as a substitute for Isaac.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_moriah.htm">Mount Moriah</a></b><br>The location where Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac, later associated with the site of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram.htm">The Ram</a></b><br>Provided by God as a substitute sacrifice, symbolizing God's provision and foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_provision.htm">Faith in God's Provision</a></b><br>Abraham's naming of the place "The LORD Will Provide" is a testament to his faith.

Abraham&#8217;s altar stood on Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>), the very site where Solomon later built the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; There, countless sacrifices pointed to the once-for-all offering of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>; 10:10).<p>&#8226; Paul ties the theme together: &#8220;He who did not spare His own Son&#8230; how will He not also&#8230; graciously give us all things?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).<p>The mountain becomes a marker of God&#8217;s unchanging commitment: He will provide&#8212;ultimately, perfectly, and eternally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a> declares that Abraham&#8217;s God intervenes at the crucial moment, provides exactly what is needed, and turns a single event into a timeless testimony. The spot named that day became a living reminder for Israel and a prophetic signpost pointing to the greater provision in Christ. The same Lord who supplied a ram for Abraham still meets His people&#8217;s needs&#8212;material, spiritual, and eternal&#8212;on His mountain of grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Jehovah-jireh.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">Jehovah will provide. </span>In <a href="/genesis/22-8.htm" title="And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.">Genesis 22:8</a>, Abraham had said "Elohim-jireh," <span class= "ital">God will provide. </span>He now uses Jehovah as the equivalent of Elohim. It is added that hence arose a proverb "In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen," or rather, <span class= "ital">In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.</span>--The verb literally means <span class= "ital">to see, </span>or, <span class= "ital">to see to a thing, </span>and the sense of the proverb plainly is that in man's necessity God will Himself see to it, and provide due help and deliverance. The Samaritan, Syriac and Vulg. have a better reading, namely, "In the mount Jehovah will provide." This makes no change in the consonants, which alone are authoritative, but only in the vowels, which were added since the Christian era, and represent the tradition of the Jewish school of Tiberias. The LXX., without changing the vowels, translate, "In the mount Jehovah shall be seen," which would be a prophecy of the manifestation of Christ. The other two renderings, besides their general proverbial sense, point onward to the providing upon this very spot of the sacrifice that was to take away the sins of the world (comp. <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm" title="But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p>But when and how did this grow into a proverb? and who added this note? It may have been inserted by Moses when he arranged these marvellous. documents; less probably by Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue, when they collected and revised the several books of Holy Scripture after the exile. In either case, the proverb is a national testimony to the genuineness of the record, and proves that the facts narrated in it were so impressed upon the memory of Abraham's descendants, as to shape their thoughts and language.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh</span>: - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Lord will provide (Jonathan, Calvin, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, etc.), rather than the Lord selects, or looks out, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. the sacrifices to be afterwards offered in the temple worship on Morish (Kalisch); or, the Lord shall appear (Oort, Kuenen), which overlooks the manifest allusion to Ver. 8 - <span class="cmt_word">as it is said to this day</span>, - or, so that it is said; cf. <a href="/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a> (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen</span> - or "it shall be provided" (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Dathe, 'Speaker's Commentary'), though by competent authorities it has been otherwise rendered. "In the mount the Lord shall appear, or be seen" (LXX.); "in the mount the Lord will see, or provide" (Vulgate, Syriac, Samaritan); "in the mount of the Lord he will be seen" (Murphy); "<span class="accented">in</span> the mount of the Lord one shall be seen," or "people appear," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people of God shall gather on this mountain for worship (Kalisch); "<span class="accented">on</span> the mountain where Jehovah appears" (Keil). Amidst such a conflict of interpretations absolute certainty is perhaps unattainable; but the sense of the proverb will probably be expressed by understanding it to mean that on the mount of Abraham's sacrifice Jehovah would afterwards reveal himself for the salvation of his people, as he then interposed for the help of Abraham - a prophecy which was afterwards fulfilled in the manifestations of the Divine glory given in the Solomonic temple and in the incarnation of Jesus Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/22-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Abraham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;&#183;h&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_85.htm">Strong's 85: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham -- 'exalted father', the father of the Jewish nation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1447;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
