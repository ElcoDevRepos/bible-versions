This indicates a high-ranking position in Egyptian society, suggesting that Potiphar had significant authority and influence. The decision to take Joseph reflects the gravity of the accusation against him, as Potiphar's wife had falsely accused Joseph of attempting to assault her. This action demonstrates the cultural and legal practices of ancient Egypt, where a servant's word held little weight against that of a master's household.<p><b>and had him thrown into the prison</b><br>The prison mentioned here is likely a part of the complex where Potiphar worked, possibly a military or royal prison. This was not a common jail but a place where political prisoners or those accused of serious crimes against the state were held. The act of throwing Joseph into prison without a trial highlights the lack of legal rights for slaves and foreigners in ancient Egypt. It also sets the stage for God's providential plan, as Joseph's imprisonment becomes a pivotal moment in his life and the history of Israel.<p><b>where the king&#8217;s prisoners were confined.</b><br>This detail indicates that the prison was specifically for those who had offended Pharaoh or were involved in matters of state. It suggests a higher level of security and importance, as these prisoners were directly connected to the king. This setting foreshadows Joseph's future interactions with Pharaoh's officials, the cupbearer and the baker, which will eventually lead to his rise to power. The mention of the king's prisoners also underscores the severity of the charges against Joseph, as he was placed among those who had committed significant offenses.<p><b>While Joseph was there in the prison,</b><br>Joseph's time in prison is a period of testing and preparation. Despite the injustice he faced, Joseph remained faithful to God, which is a recurring theme in his life. This period of suffering and waiting is reminiscent of other biblical figures who endured hardship before being elevated by God, such as David and Daniel. Joseph's experience in prison also serves as a type of Christ, who was unjustly accused and suffered before being exalted. The narrative emphasizes God's sovereignty and the idea that He can use even the most difficult circumstances for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man, favored son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.

Beneath the injustice, God is orchestrating every detail&#8212;protecting Joseph&#8217;s life, relocating him to a strategic prison, and preparing him for future authority. The verse reminds us that sudden setbacks are often stages where God&#8217;s sovereign purpose quietly advances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/39.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison</span>, - literally <span class="accented">house of enclosure</span>; <span class="accented">sohar</span>, from <span class="accented">sahar, to</span> encircle, meaning probably a turreted, arched, or rounded building for the confinement of prisoners - <span class="cmt_word">a place where the king's prisoners</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> State offenders) <span class="cmt_word">were bound: and he was there in the prison</span>.

That Joseph was not immediately punished with death is not improbable (Bohlen), but exceedingly natural, since Joseph was Potiphar's favorite (Havernick). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joseph&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1436;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">master</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_113.htm">Strong's 113: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sovereign, controller</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
