Here, the sign is the rainbow, symbolizing God's promise. Covenants are central to biblical theology, with other examples including the Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New Covenants. Each covenant has a sign, such as circumcision for Abraham and the Sabbath for Moses.<p><b>I am making between Me and you</b><br>This indicates a personal relationship between God and humanity, represented by Noah. It reflects the relational nature of God, who desires to establish a bond with His creation. This personal aspect is seen in other covenants, such as God's promises to Abraham and David.<p><b>and every living creature with you,</b><br>The covenant extends beyond humanity to include all living creatures, highlighting God's care for all creation. This universal scope is unique and underscores the comprehensive nature of God's promise. It reflects the original creation mandate where humans and animals coexist under God's provision.<p><b>a covenant for all generations to come:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the perpetual nature of the covenant. It is not limited to Noah's time but extends to all future generations.

Note:<p>&#8226; God alone authors this covenant; Noah offers no terms (cf. <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a> where God likewise acts alone with Abram).<p>&#8226; The promise is rooted in grace.

Each time the rainbow arcs across the sky, it calls us to remember the faithfulness, mercy, and authority of the God who still keeps His word today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">This is the token of the covenant.</span>--The word rendered "token" really means <span class= "ital">sign, </span>and is a term that has met with very unfortunate treatment in our Version, especially in the New Testament, where--as, for instance, in St. John's Gospel--it is too frequently translated <span class= "ital">miracle. </span>Its meaning will be best seen by examining some of the places where it occurs: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span><a href="/genesis/17-11.htm" title="And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.">Genesis 17:11</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a>; <a href="/exodus/12-13.htm" title="And the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be on you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-16.htm" title="And it shall be for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.">Exodus 13:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/17-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and you shall quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.">Numbers 17:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-12.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by the LORD, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also show kindness to my father's house, and give me a true token:">Joshua 2:12</a>; <a href="/job/21-29.htm" title="Have you not asked them that go by the way? and do you not know their tokens,">Job 21:29</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-8.htm" title="They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at your tokens: you make the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.">Psalm 65:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-17.htm" title="Show me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because you, LORD, have helped me, and comforted me.">Psalm 86:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/135-9.htm" title="Who sent tokens and wonders into the middle of you, O Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his servants.">Psalm 135:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-25.htm" title="That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;">Isaiah 44:25</a>. In the majority of these places the sign, or token, is some natural occurrence, but in its higher meaning it is a proof or indication of God's immediate working. On proper occasions, therefore, it will be supernatural, because the proof of God's direct agency will most fitly be some act such as God alone can accomplish. More frequently it is something natural. Thus the sign to the shepherds of the birth of a Saviour, who was "the anointed Jehovah" (<a href="/luke/2-11.htm" title="For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.">Luke 2:11</a>), was their finding in a manger a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, a thing of the most simple and ordinary kind. We may dismiss, then, all such curious speculations as that no rain fell before the flood, or that some condition was wanting necessary for producing this glorious symbol. What Noah needed was a guarantee and a memorial which, as often as rain occurred, would bring back to his thoughts the Divine promise; and such a memorial was best taken from the natural accompaniments of rain. We may further notice with Maimonides that the words are not, as in our version, "I do set," but <span class= "ital">my how I have set in the cloud: </span>that is, the bow which God set in the cloud on that day of creation in which He imposed upon air and water those laws which produce this phenomenon, is now to become the sign of a solemn compact made with man by God, whereby He gives man the assurance that neither himself nor his works shall ever again be swept away by a flood. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God said, This is the token</span> <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 1:14; 4:15) - <span class="cmt_word">of the covenant which I make</span> - literally, <span class="accented">am giving</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations</span>. <span class="accented">Le'doroth</span> (<span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 6:9); <span class="accented">olam</span> (from <span class="accented">alam</span>, to hide, to conceal), pr. <span class="accented">that which is hidden</span>; hence, specially, time of which either the beginning or the end is uncertain or undefined, the duration being usually determined by the nature of the case (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, 'Hebrews Lex.,' sub <span class="accented">voce</span>).
