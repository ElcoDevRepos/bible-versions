This act signifies the importance of family ties and the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams where his family would bow to him, as seen in <a href="/genesis/37-9.htm">Genesis 37:9-10</a>. It also highlights the providence of God in preserving the family line through Joseph's leadership.<p><b>and presented him before Pharaoh</b><br>The presentation of Jacob to Pharaoh is significant as it represents the meeting of two patriarchal figures: Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelites, and Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. This encounter underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be a blessing to the nations (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>). The cultural context of the time would have seen this as an honor, as Pharaoh was considered a god-like figure in Egypt.<p><b>and Jacob blessed Pharaoh</b><br>Jacob's blessing of Pharaoh is a profound moment, as it reverses the expected order; typically, the greater blesses the lesser (<a href="/hebrews/7-7.htm">Hebrews 7:7</a>). This act can be seen as a fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant, where Abraham's descendants are to be a blessing to all nations. Jacob, as a patriarch, carries the authority of God's promise, and his blessing signifies the spiritual authority and favor of God upon Pharaoh and Egypt during this time of famine. This blessing also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ, who blesses all nations through His sacrifice and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.

Pharaoh looks upon them with interest as the brothers of his vizier, grants their request for leave to dwell in Goshen, and even empowers Joseph to make the ablest of them chief herdsmen over the royal cattle. But Jacob had attained to an age which gave him great dignity: for to an Egyptian 120 was the utmost limit of longevity. Jacob was now 130, and Pharaoh treats him with the greatest honour, and twice accepts his blessing. More must be meant by this than the usual salutation, in which each one presented to the king prayed for the prolongation of his life. Pharaoh probably bowed before Jacob as a saintly personage, and received a formal benediction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh.</span> It has been thought that Jacob's presentation to the Egyptian king was deferred till after the monarch's interview with his sons because of the public and political character of that interview, relating as it did to the occupation of the land, while Jacob's introduction to the sovereign was of a purely personal and private description. <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> - in reply probably to a request from Pharaoh (Tayler Lewis), but more likely <span class="accented">sua sponte</span> - <span class="cmt_word">blessed Pharaoh</span>.
