The brothers had returned from Egypt with news that Joseph, whom they had sold into slavery, was alive and held a position of power. This revelation would have been shocking and difficult to believe, given the years of deception. The act of relaying Joseph's words signifies the importance of testimony and truth in restoring relationships. It also highlights the theme of reconciliation, as Joseph's words were intended to bring healing and unity to his family.<p><b>and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to carry him back</b><br>The wagons symbolize the tangible evidence of Joseph's status and intentions. In the ancient Near East, such wagons would have been a sign of wealth and authority, as they were not commonly used for long-distance travel by ordinary people. The presence of these wagons would have been a powerful visual confirmation of the truth of the brothers' message. This also reflects the provision and care Joseph had for his family, prefiguring the way Christ provides for His people.<p><b>the spirit of their father Jacob was revived</b><br>Jacob's spirit being revived indicates a renewal of hope and life. For years, Jacob had believed Joseph to be dead, which had caused him deep sorrow. The news of Joseph's survival and prosperity brought a restoration of joy and purpose. This revival can be seen as a type of resurrection, pointing to the ultimate hope of resurrection in Christ. It also underscores the theme of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, as Jacob's family was integral to the covenantal promises made to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
