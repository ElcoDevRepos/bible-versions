Tamar, initially married to Judah's son Er, becomes a widow and is later denied levirate marriage by Judah's second son, Onan. After Onan's death, Judah withholds his third son, Shelah, from her. Tamar's actions to secure her rights and lineage through Judah himself reflect the cultural importance of family lineage and inheritance in ancient Israel. The timing of the birth is significant, as it fulfills the promise of progeny and continuity for Judah's line, which is crucial for the unfolding of Israel's history.<p><b>there were twins in her womb</b><br>The mention of twins is significant in biblical narratives, often indicating a divine purpose or foreshadowing future events. The birth of twins here echoes the earlier story of Jacob and Esau, where the younger supplants the elder, a theme that recurs in the Bible. In this case, the twins Perez and Zerah are born, with Perez becoming an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ, as noted in the genealogies in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This connection underscores the providential unfolding of God's plan through seemingly ordinary and even morally complex circumstances. The birth of twins also highlights the theme of unexpected reversals and God's sovereignty in choosing the lineage through which the Messiah would come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>A Canaanite woman who was the daughter-in-law of Judah.
