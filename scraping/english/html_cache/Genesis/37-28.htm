They were a nomadic people known for trading, often traveling in caravans. This context highlights the interconnectedness of Abraham's descendants and sets the stage for Joseph's journey to Egypt, a pivotal moment in biblical history.<p><b>his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit</b><br>Joseph's brothers had initially thrown him into a pit, intending to leave him there to die (<a href="/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>). This act of pulling him out signifies a change in their plan, influenced by Judah's suggestion to sell him instead (<a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26-27</a>). The pit can be seen as a type of death and resurrection, prefiguring Christ's death and resurrection.<p><b>and sold him for twenty shekels of silver</b><br>The price of twenty shekels of silver was the typical value of a young male slave during this period. This transaction foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus Christ, who was sold for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). The act of selling Joseph by his own brothers highlights themes of betrayal and redemption.<p><b>to the Ishmaelites</b><br>The Ishmaelites, like the Midianites, were descendants of Abraham, through Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/16-15.htm">Genesis 16:15</a>). The interchangeable use of "Midianites" and "Ishmaelites" in this passage reflects the close relationship and overlapping identities of these groups. This connection emphasizes the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham and its unfolding through his descendants.<p><b>who took him to Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a significant location in biblical history, often representing a place of both refuge and oppression. Joseph's journey to Egypt sets the stage for the eventual migration of Jacob's family there, leading to the Israelites' enslavement and subsequent Exodus. This movement to Egypt is part of God's sovereign plan, as later revealed in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph acknowledges God's purpose in his suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who was betrayed by his brothers and sold into slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who, out of jealousy and hatred, plotted against Joseph.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianite_traders.htm">Midianite Traders</a></b><br>Merchants passing by who were involved in the transaction of selling Joseph.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmaelites.htm">Ishmaelites</a></b><br>The group to whom Joseph was sold, who then took him to Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph would eventually rise to power, but initially a place of slavery and hardship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_adversity.htm">God's Sovereignty in Adversity</a></b><br>Even in betrayal and hardship, God is at work to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_jealousy.htm">The Cost of Jealousy</a></b><br>Jealousy can lead to destructive actions that have long-lasting consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_forgiveness.htm">The Value of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Joseph's later forgiveness of his brothers is a powerful example of grace and reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_plan.htm">Trust in God's Plan</a></b><br>Like Joseph, we may not understand our circumstances, but we can trust that God is in control.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_providence.htm">The Role of Providence</a></b><br>God's providence is evident as He uses human actions, even sinful ones, to accomplish His divine will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_37_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 37:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_37_28_Sibling_jealousy_effects.htm">How does Genesis 37:28 illustrate the consequences of jealousy among siblings?
