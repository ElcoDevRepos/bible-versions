Dreams in the ancient Near East were often considered messages from the divine. Joseph's ability to receive and interpret dreams foreshadows his future role in Egypt. This dream is a continuation of God's plan for Joseph, indicating his future rise to prominence.<p><b>and told it to his brothers.</b><br>Joseph's decision to share his dream with his brothers, despite their previous jealousy, highlights his youthful naivety or perhaps a sense of divine compulsion. His brothers' animosity is deepened by these revelations, setting the stage for their betrayal. This act of sharing dreams can be seen as a catalyst for the events that lead Joseph to Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I had another dream,</b><br>The repetition of dreams emphasizes their importance and certainty. In biblical narratives, God often confirms His plans through repetition. Joseph's insistence on sharing the dream suggests a confidence in its divine origin and significance.<p><b>and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.&#8221;</b><br>The imagery of the sun, moon, and stars is symbolic. The sun and moon likely represent Joseph's father and mother, while the eleven stars symbolize his brothers. This dream indicates Joseph's future authority over his family, which is fulfilled when they come to Egypt during the famine. The celestial imagery also connects to biblical themes of God's sovereignty and order. This dream can be seen as a type of Christ, who is exalted above all and before whom every knee will bow, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, known for his dreams and the coat of many colors.

It is apparent that Joseph understood this second dream, even more plainly than the first, to foreshadow, in some way unexplained, his future supremacy over his brethren, who were unmistakably pointed out by the eleven stars of the vision; and this remarkable coincidence between the number of the stars and the number of his brethren would facilitate the inference that his parents were referred to under the other symbols of the sun and moon. In the most ancient symbology, Oriental and Grecian as well as Biblical (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), it was customary to speak of noble personages, princes, etc., under such figures; and the employment of such terminology by a nomadic people like the Hebrew patriarchs, who constantly lived beneath the open sky, may almost be regarded as a water-mark attesting the historic credibility of this page at least of the sacred record (vide Havernick, 'Introd.,' &sect; 21), in opposition to Bohlen, who finds in the symbolical character of Joseph s dreams an evidence of their unreality, and De Wette, who explains them as the offspring of his aspiring mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/37-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [Joseph] had another</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dream</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2492.htm">Strong's 2492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind firmly, to be, plump, to dream</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1505;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;sap&#183;p&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5608.htm">Strong's 5608: </a> </span><span class="str2">To count, recount, relate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it to his brothers.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
