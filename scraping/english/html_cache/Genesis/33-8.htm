In the ancient Near Eastern culture, the sending of a large company or entourage could signify various intentions, such as a gesture of peace, a show of power, or a request for favor. Esau, having been wronged by Jacob in the past (Genesis 27), might have been wary of Jacob's intentions. The "whole company" refers to the gifts and servants Jacob sent ahead as a peace offering, which was a common practice to appease or honor someone of higher status. This encounter takes place in the region of Seir, where Esau had settled, indicating a geographical separation between the brothers that had persisted since Jacob fled to Haran.<p><b>&#8220;To find favor in your sight, my lord,&#8221; Jacob answered.</b><br>Jacob's response is one of humility and deference, addressing Esau as "my lord," which indicates a recognition of Esau's status and an attempt to reconcile. This phrase echoes the cultural norms of the time, where seeking favor was often accompanied by gifts and respectful language. The use of "favor" is significant in biblical narratives, often denoting grace or acceptance, and can be seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a> and <a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>. Jacob's approach can be seen as a type of Christ, who also seeks reconciliation and peace, offering Himself as a gift to restore broken relationships. This act of seeking favor is a turning point in Jacob's life, showing a transformation from his earlier deceitful ways to a more humble and penitent character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who had previously deceived his brother Esau out of his birthright and blessing.

After twenty years, he expects a personal reunion, yet a vast caravan of animals and servants precedes Jacob (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows gifts often paved the way for peace&#8212;Abraham with the kings of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20-24</a>) and later Abigail with David (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18-35</a>). The large &#8220;company&#8221; is, therefore, a tangible peace offering.<p>&#8226; Esau&#8217;s question surfaces a moment of evaluation: will he accept the gesture or revive his old grievance (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>)?

His gifts align with his prayer, demonstrating repentance and humility (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Esau &#8220;my lord&#8221; flips their earlier struggle over supremacy (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>).
