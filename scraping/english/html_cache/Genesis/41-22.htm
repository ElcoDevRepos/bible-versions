Joseph, the interpreter of this dream, had previously experienced God-given dreams about his own future (Genesis 37). Dreams were considered significant in ancient cultures, including Egypt, where this narrative takes place.<p><b>I also saw</b><br>This indicates a continuation or addition to the previous dream, emphasizing the importance of the imagery. Pharaoh's dreams were meant to convey a message that required divine interpretation, which Joseph was able to provide.<p><b>seven heads of grain</b><br>The number seven is symbolic in the Bible, often representing completeness or perfection. In this context, it foreshadows the seven years of abundance that Egypt would experience. Grain was a staple food in Egypt, crucial for survival and prosperity.<p><b>plump and ripe</b><br>These adjectives suggest abundance and prosperity. The imagery of healthy grain signifies a period of plenty, which is later contrasted with the subsequent dream of thin and scorched heads of grain, symbolizing famine.<p><b>growing on a single stalk</b><br>This detail highlights the unity and strength of the forthcoming period of abundance. In agricultural terms, a single stalk bearing multiple heads of grain would be seen as a sign of exceptional fertility and blessing. This imagery underscores the divine provision and the importance of wise stewardship during times of plenty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who has troubling dreams that need interpretation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man, known for his ability to interpret dreams, who is called upon to explain Pharaoh's dreams.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The setting of the account, a powerful ancient civilization where Joseph is currently residing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dreams.htm">Dreams</a></b><br>A significant means through which God communicates His plans and purposes in this account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_heads_of_grain.htm">Seven Heads of Grain</a></b><br>Symbolic elements in Pharaoh's dream representing years of abundance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_dreams.htm">God's Sovereignty in Dreams</a></b><br>God uses dreams to reveal His plans.

Dreams in Scripture are neither random nor merely psychological; they are one of the ways the Lord faithfully speaks when a message must reach rulers and shape history. By listening, Joseph models <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>&#8212;acknowledging God in every circumstance.<p>&#8226; God-initiated dreams often arrive when human plans are powerless.<p>&#8226; They carry authority on par with any spoken word the Lord gives (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I also saw</b><p>This phrase links the grain scene to the earlier vision of the cows (<a href="/genesis/41-17.htm">Genesis 41:17-21</a>). The repetition underscores certainty, as Joseph later explains: &#8220;The dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms, because the matter has been firmly decided by God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>). Like Joseph&#8217;s own paired dreams in <a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-9</a>, the doubled picture eliminates guesswork and invites immediate obedience (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God often confirms His purposes with corroborating evidence (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Seeing &#8220;also&#8221; teaches that every detail in divine revelation works together to form a single, harmonious message (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven heads of grain</b><p>Seven, consistently a number of fullness and completion (<a href="/leviticus/25-8.htm">Leviticus 25:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>), stands here for seven literal years (<a href="/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26</a>). Grain, the staple of Egypt&#8217;s economy, pinpoints where abundance&#8212;or later famine&#8212;will be felt most. The specificity displays God&#8217;s intimate knowledge of national affairs (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The heads picture full agricultural cycles, not vague seasons.<p>&#8226; By choosing grain rather than gold or armies, the Lord highlights daily bread&#8212;echoing <a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>&#8217;s reminder of our continual dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>plump and ripe</b><p>The heads are described as well-fed, bursting with life&#8212;imagery of prosperity akin to <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a> and <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>. Egypt would soon experience overflowing barns and satisfied people. The richness also reveals God&#8217;s goodness; abundance precedes judgment, giving Pharaoh time to respond wisely (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Plump&#8221; contrasts sharply with the later thin, scorched heads (<a href="/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23-24</a>), dramatizing the swing from plenty to need.<p>&#8226; True prosperity comes from God&#8217;s hand, not merely from Nile floods (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>growing on a single stalk</b><p>Seven fertile heads emerging from one stalk would arrest any farmer&#8217;s attention. The picture unites multiplicity and oneness&#8212;seven separate years of blessing, yet issuing from a single divine provision (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25</a>). As Jesus fed multitudes from one boy&#8217;s lunch (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9-13</a>), God can multiply resource beyond natural expectation.<p>&#8226; The singular stalk hints that Egypt&#8217;s bounty will spring from one central source: the Lord who controls the Nile&#8217;s rhythms (<a href="/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The unity also suggests centralized stewardship, later seen in Joseph&#8217;s storehouses (<a href="/genesis/41-48.htm">Genesis 41:48-49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-22.htm">Genesis 41:22</a> presents a vivid, God-given snapshot of impending abundance: seven complete, overflowing years of grain, unified in origin and purpose.

By recognizing the Lord&#8217;s hand in both prosperity and famine, Pharaoh is readied for Joseph&#8217;s counsel, and we are reminded to trust the One who directs history and provides daily bread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In my dream</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1465;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
