This famine is distinct from the one in Abraham's time, highlighting recurring challenges faced by the patriarchs. Famines often tested faith and prompted divine intervention or guidance, as seen in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and later Joseph.<p><b>subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham&#8217;s time</b><br>The previous famine during Abraham's time led him to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>). This reference establishes a pattern of testing and divine provision across generations. It underscores the continuity of God's covenant promises despite recurring hardships.<p><b>And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar</b><br>Gerar was a Philistine city located in the Negev region. Abimelech is likely a dynastic title rather than a personal name, as seen in Abraham's interactions with a king of the same name (Genesis 20). This journey reflects Isaac's search for sustenance and safety, paralleling Abraham's earlier experiences. The Philistines, though not yet the powerful force they would become in later biblical narratives, were significant regional players. Isaac's interactions with Abimelech foreshadow future Israelite-Philistine relations and demonstrate God's protection and blessing on Isaac amidst foreign powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.

God&#8217;s Word records a specific famine, just as it records the one in Abraham&#8217;s day (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>) or the devastating drought in Joseph&#8217;s era (<a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>).<p>&#8226; Famines often serve as backdrops for God&#8217;s providential work&#8212;see <a href="/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a> or <a href="/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1&#8211;2</a>&#8212;and highlight our dependence on Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham&#8217;s time</b><p>&#8226; The Spirit points us to an earlier famine to invite comparison. Abraham faced scarcity and chose Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10&#8211;13</a>); Isaac will be guided differently, underscoring that God tailors His instructions to each generation.<p>&#8226; Repetition in Scripture signals purpose: Abraham&#8217;s covenant line is tested again, proving God&#8217;s promises endure despite new hardships (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Patterns remind us that trials do not negate blessing; they often frame it (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines</b><p>&#8226; Isaac responds with practical action&#8212;seeking relief under regional leadership&#8212;yet he does not leave Canaan outright. This shows faith balanced with prudence (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Abimelech&#8221; is likely a dynastic title, as another ruler with that name interacted with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/20-1.htm">Genesis 20:1&#8211;18</a>; 21:22&#8211;34). The repetition highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to protect His people even among foreigners.<p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s move sets up further covenant encounters: God will soon appear and reaffirm His oath (<a href="/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2&#8211;5</a>), proving that obedience and revelation often meet at moments of need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At Gerar</b><p>&#8226; Gerar lay in the southwest of Canaan, within Philistine territory (<a href="/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>).

The verse links Isaac&#8217;s crisis to his father&#8217;s, signaling a continuing theme of testing and promise. Isaac chooses not to flee the land but to seek provision under Abimelech in Gerar, staying within the borders God pledged to his line. The setting prepares readers for God&#8217;s fresh confirmation of the covenant and shows that every generation must trust the LORD anew, even when circumstances repeat familiar hardships.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXVI.<p>ADVENTURES OF ISAAC AT GERAR.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Isaac went</span> . . . <span class= "bld">unto Gerar.</span>--Following the stream of Semitic migration (<a href="/genesis/12-15.htm" title="The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.">Genesis 12:15</a>), Isaac had originally purposed going to Egypt, but is commanded by God to abide in the land, and upon so doing he receives the assurance that he will be confirmed in the inheritance of the promises made to his father.
