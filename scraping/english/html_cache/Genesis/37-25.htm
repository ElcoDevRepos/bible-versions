This act of eating while their brother is in distress underscores their lack of compassion and foreshadows their later actions. In biblical culture, sharing a meal often signifies fellowship and peace, yet here it is marked by betrayal and indifference.<p><b>they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead</b><br>The Ishmaelites, descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar, are traders traveling from Gilead, a region known for its balm and spices. This connection to Ishmael highlights the ongoing narrative of family divisions and tensions that trace back to Abraham. Gilead's location east of the Jordan River was known for its medicinal products, indicating the trade routes and economic activities of the time.<p><b>Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh</b><br>These goods were valuable trade items in the ancient Near East. Spices and myrrh were used for anointing and embalming, while balm was a healing ointment. The mention of these items not only provides historical context about trade practices but also foreshadows the later use of myrrh in the burial of Jesus (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>), drawing a typological connection between Joseph and Christ.<p><b>on their way down to Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a significant location in biblical history, often representing a place of both refuge and bondage. Joseph's journey to Egypt sets the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and the Exodus. This movement towards Egypt also prefigures the flight of Jesus' family to Egypt to escape Herod's massacre (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>), further linking Joseph's story to the life of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who were envious of Joseph and plotted against him.

As the eastern side of Canaan is covered by the great Arabian desert, the caravans had to travel in a north-westernly direction until, having forded the Euphrates, they could strike across from Tadmor to Gilead. The route thence led them over the Jordan at Beisan, and so southward to Egypt. For "Ishmeelites," we have "Midianites," Heb., <span class= "ital">Medyanim, </span>in <a href="/genesis/37-28.htm" title="Then there passed by Midianites merchants; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.">Genesis 37:28</a>, and Medanites, Heb., <span class= "ital">Medanim, </span>in <a href="/genesis/37-36.htm" title="And the Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.">Genesis 37:36</a>; but the Targum and the Syriac, instead of Ishmeelites, read <span class= "ital">Arabs. </span>Midian was a son of Abraham by Keturah, and Ishmael was his son by Hagar. But probably these merchants were descended from neither by blood, but belonged to some branch of the Canaanites, who were the great traders of ancient times, and which Ishmael and Midian had compelled to submit to their sway. (But see Note on <a href="/genesis/25-2.htm" title="And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.">Genesis 25:2</a>.) The Jewish interpreters are reduced to great straits in reconciling these names, and even assert that Joseph was sold three times. Really Ishmeelites, Midianites, and Medanites are all one and the same, if we regard them as bearing the names only politically.<p>It is remarkable that the Egyptians never took part in the carrying trade. Even the navigation of the Red Sea they left to the Ph?nicians, Israelites, and Syrians, though Psammetichus, Pharaoh-Necho, and Apries tried to induce the Egyptians to take to maritime pursuits. Their products were corn, stuffs of byssus and other materials, and carpets; but the exportation of these goods they left to foreign traders.<p><span class= "bld">Spicery, and balm, and myrrh.</span>--The first was probably gum tragacanth, though some think that it was storax, the gum of the styrax tree (see <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm" title="And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.">Genesis 30:37</a>). "Balm," that&#250;is, balsam, was probably the resin of the <span class= "ital">balsamodendron Gileadense, </span>a tree which grows abundantly in Gilead, and of which the gum was greatly in use for healing wounds. "Myrrh" was certainly <span class= "ital">ladanum, </span>the gum of the cistus rose (<span class= "ital">cistus creticus</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>As all these were products of Palestine valued in Egypt, Jacob included them in his present to the governor there (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this;
