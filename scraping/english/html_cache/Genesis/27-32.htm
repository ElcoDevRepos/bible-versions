In the context of <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>, Isaac is old and his eyesight is failing, which sets the stage for the deception by Jacob and Rebekah. Isaac's question indicates his uncertainty and the beginning of the unraveling of the deception. This moment is pivotal as it highlights the tension and drama in the narrative. The question "Who are you?" also echoes the theme of identity, which is central to the story of Jacob and Esau. In a broader biblical context, questions of identity and recognition are significant, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Joseph's brothers not recognizing him in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/42-8.htm">Genesis 42:8</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I am Esau, your firstborn son,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>Esau's identity as the firstborn is crucial in the biblical context, as the firstborn traditionally held the birthright and blessing, which were of great importance in ancient Near Eastern culture. The birthright included leadership of the family and a double portion of the inheritance. Esau's declaration of his identity is ironic here, as it is actually Jacob speaking, having disguised himself to receive the blessing meant for Esau. This deception fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where God tells her that "the older will serve the younger." The theme of the younger supplanting the older is a recurring motif in the Bible, seen in stories like those of Joseph and David. This moment also foreshadows the later struggles between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Edom). In a typological sense, Jacob's deception and the subsequent blessing can be seen as a foreshadowing of the grace that comes through Jesus Christ, who, though not recognized by many, brings the ultimate blessing to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, son of Abraham, and father of Esau and Jacob.

The moment is loaded with divine tension&#8212;God had foretold, &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), yet Isaac had tried to bless Esau anyway.<p>&#8226; Compare <a href="/genesis/27-33.htm">Genesis 27:33</a>, where Isaac &#8220;trembled violently&#8221;; the patriarch senses God&#8217;s overruling hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s question exposes lingering doubt; earlier he had said, &#8220;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights how human perception can be clouded when we rely on physical evidence rather than spiritual discernment&#8212;see <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p>&#8226; This pause gives God space to uncover deception and fulfill His stated plan without violating human freedom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am Esau&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Esau answers truthfully; unlike Jacob&#8217;s earlier lie (<a href="/genesis/27-19.htm">Genesis 27:19</a>), this declaration rings genuine.<p>&#8226; Yet his words reveal the tragedy of arriving moments late; <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a> recalls how, &#8220;when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The scene underscores that spiritual privileges can be forfeited through earlier despising of them (<a href="/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;your firstborn son&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Esau asserts his legal status, expecting the automatic rights of primogeniture (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows God is free to elevate whomever He chooses&#8212;note God&#8217;s selection of Joseph over Reuben (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds readers that being &#8220;firstborn&#8221; in flesh does not guarantee spiritual favor; <a href="/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a> points to birth &#8220;of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;he answered&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

His forthcoming honesty can&#8217;t undo past choices; <a href="/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> records his bitter cry, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he rightly named Jacob?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse therefore warns that sincerity, though commendable, cannot replace obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-32.htm">Genesis 27:32</a> captures a pivotal unveiling: Isaac&#8217;s probing, Esau&#8217;s self-identification, and the collision of human intention with divine sovereignty. The verse reminds believers that God&#8217;s purposes stand, even when patriarchs falter, and that blessings tied to covenant obedience cannot be claimed merely by birthright or timing but only through alignment with God&#8217;s revealed will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou</span>? The language indicates the patriarch's surprise. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</span> The emphatic tone of Esau's answer may have been dictated by a suspicion, already awakened by Isaac's question, that all was not right (Inglis). Esau's claim to be regarded as Isaac's firstborn, after having bartered away his birthright, is considered by some to be unwarranted (Wordsworth); but it is doubtful if Esau attached the importance to the term "firstborn" which this objection presupposes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But his father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
