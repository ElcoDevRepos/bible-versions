Chariots were used by Egyptian nobility and military leaders, indicating Joseph's significant position. This preparation signifies his eagerness and respect for the reunion with his father, Israel.<p><b>and went there to meet his father Israel.</b><br>The journey to meet Jacob, also known as Israel, highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to preserve Jacob's family. This meeting takes place in Goshen, a fertile region in Egypt, which would later become the dwelling place for the Israelites. The name "Israel" is significant, as it reflects Jacob's God-given identity and the covenant promises associated with it.<p><b>Joseph presented himself to him,</b><br>Joseph's presentation to his father is a moment of revelation and fulfillment.

It is a moment of healing and restoration after years of separation and presumed death. This embrace can be seen as a type of Christ's reconciliation with humanity, offering forgiveness and restoration.<p><b>and wept profusely.</b><br>Joseph's weeping reflects the depth of his emotions and the culmination of God's providential care. It is a moment of overwhelming joy and relief, as well as a release of years of pent-up emotions.
