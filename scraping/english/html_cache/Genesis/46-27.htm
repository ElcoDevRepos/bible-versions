Their birth in a foreign land signifies God's providence and the continuation of His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, even outside the Promised Land. Joseph's marriage to Asenath, an Egyptian, and the birth of his sons in Egypt, demonstrate God's sovereignty in using unexpected circumstances to fulfill His purposes. The inclusion of these sons in the family of Israel foreshadows the later adoption of Gentiles into the spiritual family of God, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>the members of Jacob&#8217;s family who went to Egypt</b><br>This phrase refers to the entire household of Jacob, also known as Israel, who migrated to Egypt during the famine. This move was significant in the unfolding of God's plan, as it set the stage for the Israelites' eventual enslavement and subsequent deliverance, which is a central theme in the book of Exodus. The migration to Egypt was a fulfillment of God's word to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, where He foretold that Abraham's descendants would be strangers in a land not their own and would be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years.<p><b>were seventy in all</b><br>The number seventy is symbolic and significant in biblical numerology, often representing completeness or a full measure. This number includes Jacob, his sons, and their families, signifying the entirety of the Israelite clan at that time. The number seventy also connects to the table of nations in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, where seventy nations are listed, symbolizing the universality of God's plan for humanity. In the New Testament, Jesus sends out seventy disciples (<a href="/luke/10.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), which may echo this theme of completeness and the spreading of God's message to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.
