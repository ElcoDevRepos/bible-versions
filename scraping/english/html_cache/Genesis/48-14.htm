Israel, also known as Jacob, intentionally places his right hand on Ephraim, the younger son of Joseph, signifying a deliberate choice to bestow a greater blessing upon him. This act defies the cultural norm of primogeniture, where the firstborn typically receives the primary blessing. This mirrors Jacob's own experience, where he, the younger, received the blessing over Esau. It highlights God's sovereignty in choosing whom He wills, regardless of human customs.<p><b>and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh&#8217;s head,</b><br>The crossing of hands is a symbolic gesture that indicates a reversal of expectations. Manasseh, as the firstborn, would traditionally receive the greater blessing, but Jacob's action signifies a divinely inspired decision. This act of crossing hands can be seen as a type of Christ, who often subverted societal norms and expectations, choosing the humble and lowly to fulfill God's purposes. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme where the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.<p><b>although Manasseh was the firstborn.</b><br>The mention of Manasseh being the firstborn emphasizes the significance of Jacob's choice. It underscores the biblical theme that God's plans and purposes often transcend human traditions and expectations. This choice reflects the recurring biblical motif of God elevating the younger or less likely candidate, as seen with Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, and David over his older brothers. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereign will and His ability to work through unexpected means to accomplish His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob, who was renamed Israel by God.
