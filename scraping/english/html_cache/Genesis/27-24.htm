This moment is pivotal in the narrative of Jacob's deception to receive the blessing meant for Esau. Isaac's doubt suggests he is not fully convinced by Jacob's disguise, highlighting the tension and drama in the story. The repetition of the question underscores Isaac's uncertainty and the gravity of the blessing about to be given. This scene is set in the patriarchal period, where blessings were considered binding and prophetic, often determining the future of entire lineages. The cultural context of the time placed immense importance on the firstborn's blessing, which was both a spiritual and material inheritance. This moment also foreshadows the later struggles between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Edom).<p><b>And he replied, &#8220;I am.&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's response is a direct lie, showcasing his willingness to deceive to obtain the blessing. This act of deception is a critical turning point in Jacob's life and sets the stage for his later transformation. Theologically, this moment can be seen as part of God's sovereign plan, as Jacob was chosen to carry on the Abrahamic covenant despite his flawed actions. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of identity and the consequences of deceit. Jacob's lie here leads to significant personal and familial conflict, yet it also becomes a part of his journey towards becoming Israel, the father of the twelve tribes. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ in the sense that, unlike Jacob, Jesus is the true firstborn who does not deceive but fulfills the promises of God faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the father of Esau and Jacob.

This repetition highlights both his lingering suspicion and the weight of the blessing about to be bestowed (v. 27&#8211;29). Similar moments of double-checking appear when Joseph tests his brothers (<a href="/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7&#8211;17</a>) and when Gideon seeks confirmation from the LORD (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>). The narrative reminds us that human hesitation often precedes pivotal acts of faith&#8212;or, in this case, tragic deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are you really my son Esau?</b><p>Isaac&#8217;s question underscores the covenantal gravity of firstborn rights (<a href="/genesis/25-31.htm">Genesis 25:31-34</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a>). The birthright and blessing carried legal and spiritual authority; once spoken, they could not be revoked (<a href="/genesis/27-33.htm">Genesis 27:33</a>). Isaac&#8217;s blindness (v. 1) is more than physical; it symbolizes a partial spiritual blindness to God&#8217;s earlier oracle that &#8220;the older shall serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Like Samuel later misreading Eliab&#8217;s appearance (<a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6-7</a>), Isaac looks for outward confirmation of Esau while overlooking God&#8217;s declared plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he replied</b><p>Jacob answers without hesitation, illustrating the depth of his premeditated scheme (v. 15-17). This quick response exposes how easily sin compounds once the first step is taken (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-5</a>; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). Though Rebecca and Jacob manipulate events, God sovereignly weaves even human failings into His redemptive program, much as He later uses Joseph&#8217;s brothers&#8217; evil for good (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am.</b><p>This terse lie completes Jacob&#8217;s impersonation. In contrast, Jesus later affirms, &#8220;I am the way and the truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), showing the chasm between human deceit and divine integrity. Jacob&#8217;s false &#8220;I am&#8221; secures the blessing but triggers a cascade of consequences&#8212;family fracture (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41-45</a>), exile (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10</a>), and years of hard service under Laban (<a href="/genesis/29-20.htm">Genesis 29:20-28</a>). Yet God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>), and Jacob&#8217;s eventual wrestling at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>) begins transforming the deceiver into Israel, the one who strives with God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-24.htm">Genesis 27:24</a> records Isaac&#8217;s final probing and Jacob&#8217;s decisive lie. The verse spotlights the seriousness of covenant blessings, the peril of deceit, and the mysterious sovereignty of God who fulfills His word despite human failure. Jacob gains what he seeks, but the cost drives him into God&#8217;s refining hands, proving that the Lord&#8217;s purposes stand even when His people stumble.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span> (showing that a feeling of uneasy suspicion yet lingered in his mind), <span class="cmt_word">Art thou my very son Esau</span>?
