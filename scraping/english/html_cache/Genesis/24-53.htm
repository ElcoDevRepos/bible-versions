Silver and gold were highly valued, often used as currency and a sign of prosperity. Clothing, especially fine garments, was a luxury and a status symbol. This act reflects the wealth of Abraham's household and the importance of the marriage alliance. The giving of such gifts can be seen as a foreshadowing of the spiritual riches found in Christ, who provides for His bride, the Church.<p><b>and he gave them to Rebekah</b><br>Rebekah, as the chosen bride for Isaac, receives these gifts as a token of the covenant being established. This act signifies her acceptance into Abraham's family and the beginning of her new role. It parallels the New Testament concept of believers receiving spiritual gifts upon entering into a relationship with Christ. The gifts also serve as a pledge of the promises to come, much like the Holy Spirit is a guarantee of our inheritance in Christ.<p><b>He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother</b><br>In the cultural context, it was customary to give gifts to the bride's family as part of the marriage arrangement, known as a bride price or dowry. This practice ensured the family's support and approval of the marriage. The mention of Rebekah's brother and mother highlights the patriarchal and matriarchal roles in family decisions. The gifts to the family can be seen as a gesture of goodwill and respect, ensuring a harmonious relationship between the families. This act reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and blessing extending to entire households, as seen in the stories of Cornelius and Lydia in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, often identified as Eliezer, is tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.

Quickly indeed in a country of such ceremonial politeness the purchase took a more honourable form, but Orientals do not let their courtesy interfere with their interests, and the relatives would take care that the freewill offerings did not fall below the usual standard. These went partly to the bride, and partly to her relatives: and as they are described here as going exclusively to the brother and mother, Jewish tradition has invented the story that Bethuel was ill at the time, and died on the day of the servant's arrival. But the manner in which Isaac speaks of him in <a href="/genesis/28-2.htm" title="Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel your mother's father; and take you a wife from there of the daughers of Laban your mother's brother.">Genesis 28:2</a> does not allow us to suppose that he was either dead at the time of her departure, or that he was a person of no ability or importance.
