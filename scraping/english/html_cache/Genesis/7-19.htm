The word "prevailed" suggests dominance and overwhelming force, reflecting the judgment of God upon a sinful world. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking a divine reset of creation. The flood narrative parallels the creation account, where the Spirit of God moved over the waters, symbolizing both destruction and the potential for new beginnings. The floodwaters covering the earth can be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing cleansing and renewal, prefiguring Christian baptism.<p><b>so that all the high mountains under all the heavens were covered</b><br>This phrase underscores the universality of the flood, indicating that it was not a local event but one that affected the entire earth. The covering of "all the high mountains" signifies the extent of God's judgment, leaving no place untouched. This total coverage can be seen as a reversal of creation, where land emerged from the waters. Theologically, it points to the seriousness of sin and the comprehensive nature of divine judgment. The mention of "all the heavens" suggests the flood's impact on the entire created order, reinforcing the idea of a cosmic reset. This event foreshadows the final judgment, where all creation will be renewed and restored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve life on earth.
