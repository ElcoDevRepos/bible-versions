The emphasis on "your son" highlights the personal sacrifice involved. Abraham had waited many years for the birth of Isaac, the son of promise, making this command particularly poignant.<p><b>your only son Isaac,</b><br>Although Abraham had another son, Ishmael, Isaac is referred to as his "only son" because he is the child of promise through whom God's covenant would be fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19-21</a>). This phrase foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus is referred to as God's "only begotten Son" (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>), drawing a parallel between Isaac and Jesus as beloved sons.<p><b>whom you love,</b><br>This is the first mention of love in the Bible, emphasizing the deep affection Abraham has for Isaac. It underscores the magnitude of the test, as Abraham is asked to sacrifice the one he loves most. This mirrors God's love for His Son, Jesus, whom He also offered as a sacrifice for humanity.<p><b>and go to the land of Moriah.</b><br>Moriah is significant both geographically and theologically. It is traditionally identified with the area where Solomon later built the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). This location becomes a central place of worship and sacrifice in Israel's history, and it is also associated with the crucifixion of Jesus, drawing a typological connection between Isaac and Christ.<p><b>Offer him there as a burnt offering</b><br>A burnt offering was a complete sacrifice, symbolizing total dedication to God. This command tests Abraham's faith to the utmost, as it seems to contradict God's promise to make Isaac a great nation (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>). The concept of substitutionary sacrifice is introduced here, which is later fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the ultimate sacrifice for sin.<p><b>on one of the mountains,</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often represent places of divine encounter and revelation. This specific mountain, chosen by God, becomes a place of profound spiritual significance, prefiguring the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.<p><b>which I will show you.</b><br>This phrase indicates that Abraham must trust God completely, not only in the act of sacrifice but also in the journey itself. It reflects the walk of faith, where believers are called to trust in God's guidance without knowing all the details, similar to how Christians are called to live by faith (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign deity who commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, testing his faith and obedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

It thus makes the words more an exhortation than a command.<p><span class= "bld">Thine only son Isaac.</span>--The words in the original are more emphatic, being, "Take, I pray, thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac." If childlessness was so unendurable in old time to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), what would it be now, after so many years of enjoyment of a son, and after giving up Ishmael for his sake (<a href="/genesis/17-18.htm" title="And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before you!">Genesis 17:18</a>)?<p><span class= "bld">The land of Moriah.</span>--Moriah may either mean <span class= "ital">Jah is teacher </span>(see Note on <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), or <span class= "ital">Jah is provider. </span>The first is supported by <a href="/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>, where the verb is rendered <span class= "ital">will teach; </span>but the second agrees best with <a href="/genesis/22-8.htm" title="And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.">Genesis 22:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-14.htm" title="And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.">Genesis 22:14</a>. If this be the meaning, the name would be derived from this event, and would signify the place where "Jehovah will Himself provide the sacrifice." It has been suggested by many able commentators, that the place meant was Moreh in Sichem, and that the site of the sacrifice was, as the Samaritans affirmed, the natural altar upon the summit of Mount Gerizim. But as Abraham and Isaac reached the spot on the third day, and evidently at an early hour, Gerizim is too remote from Beer-sheba for this to be possible Even Jerusalem is distant enough, as the journey from Beer-sheba takes twenty and a half hours; and travellers in those days had to cook their own food, and prepare their own sleeping accommodation. We may notice also, that Moriah is described as "a land," in some part of which Abraham was to be shown the special mountain intended for the sacrifice; Moreh, on the contrary, was a place where Abraham had lived, and which was therefore well known to him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Take</span> now - "the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> modifies the command, and seems to express that Elohim wished to receive the sacrifice as a free-will offering" (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">thy son</span> (not a lamb, but thy child), <span class="cmt_word">thine only son</span> - not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (LXX.), but <span class="accented">unigenitum</span> (Vulgate), meaning the only son of Sarah, the only legitimate offspring he possessed, the only heir of the promise, the only child that remained to him after Ishmael's departure (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">Isaac, whom thou lovest,</span> - or, <span class="accented">whom thou lovest, Isaac</span>; the order and accumulation of the terms being calculated to excite the parental affection of the patriarch to the highest pitch, and to render compliance with the Divine demand a trial of the utmost severity - <span class="cmt_word">and get thee</span> - literally, <span class="accented">go for thyself</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/21-16.htm">Genesis 21:16</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">into the land of Moriah</span>.
