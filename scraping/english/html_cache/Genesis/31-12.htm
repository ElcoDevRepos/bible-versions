In biblical narratives, being told to "look up" often signifies a moment of divine intervention or insight. It suggests that Jacob is being called to pay attention to something significant that God is about to reveal. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where God communicates through visions, such as with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>.<p><b>&#8216;and see that all the males that are mating with the flock are streaked, spotted, or speckled;</b><br>The description of the animals as "streaked, spotted, or speckled" is significant in the context of Jacob's agreement with Laban. Jacob had made a deal to take the less desirable animals as his wages (<a href="/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32-33</a>). This vision confirms God's involvement in ensuring Jacob's prosperity despite Laban's attempts to cheat him. The specific mention of these patterns also highlights God's control over nature and His ability to bless Jacob through seemingly natural means.<p><b>for I have seen all that Laban has done to you.</b><br>This phrase reassures Jacob that God is aware of the injustices he has suffered at the hands of Laban. It reflects the biblical theme of God's omniscience and His concern for justice. This assurance is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God tells Moses that He has seen the affliction of His people in Egypt. It underscores the idea that God is a righteous judge who sees and will act on behalf of those who are wronged.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and the central figure in this account.

Since all the parti-colored animals had already been removed (<a href="/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>), this vision must have been intended to assure him that the flocks would produce speckled and spotted progeny all the same as if the ringstraked and grisled rams and he-goats had not been removed from their midst (cf. Kurtz, &sect; 78). To insist upon a contradiction between this account of the increase of Jacob's flocks and that mentioned in <a href="/genesis/30-37.htm">Genesis 30:37</a> is to forget that both may be true. Equally arbitrary does it seem to be to accuse Jacob of fraud in adopting the artifice of the pilled rods (Kalisch). Without resorting to the supposition that he acted under God s guidance (Wordsworth), we may believe that the dream suggested the expedient referred to, in which some see Jacob's unbelief and impatience (Kurtz, Gosman in Lange), and others a praiseworthy instance of self-help (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee</span>. If the preceding clause appears to imply that the vision was sent to Jacob at the beginning of the six years' service, the present clause scents to point to the end of that period as the date of its occurrence; in which case it would require to be understood as a Divine intimation to Jacob that his immense wealth was not to be ascribed to the success of his own stratagem, but to the blessing of God (Delitzsch). The difficulty of harmonizing the two views has led to the suggestion that Jacob here mixes the accounts of two different visions accorded to him, at the commencement and at the close of the period of servitude (Nachmanides, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kurtz,- ' Speaker's Commentary,' Murphy, Candlish). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/31-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Look up,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
