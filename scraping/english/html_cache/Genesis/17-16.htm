In the biblical context, a blessing from God often signifies prosperity, fertility, and divine approval. Sarah, previously barren, is now promised a blessing that will change her status and role in the unfolding of God's covenant with Abraham. This blessing is a direct act of God, emphasizing His sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>and will surely give you a son by her.</b><br>This promise is significant as it confirms that Sarah, despite her old age, will bear a son. This son, Isaac, is the child of promise through whom God's covenant with Abraham will continue. The miraculous nature of this birth prefigures other miraculous births in the Bible, including that of Jesus Christ. It underscores the theme of God's power to bring life and fulfill His promises against all odds.<p><b>I will bless her,</b><br>The repetition of the blessing emphasizes its certainty and importance. It highlights Sarah's pivotal role in God's plan, not just as Abraham's wife but as a matriarch in the lineage of faith. This blessing also serves to elevate Sarah's status, ensuring that she is remembered as a key figure in the history of Israel and the broader narrative of salvation.<p><b>and she will be the mother of nations;</b><br>This phrase points to the future impact of Sarah's offspring. Through Isaac, Sarah becomes the matriarch of the Israelite nation. The reference to "nations" suggests a broader influence, as her descendants include not only the Israelites but also other groups, such as the Edomites through Esau. This aligns with God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations.<p><b>kings of peoples will descend from her.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy indicates that Sarah's lineage will include royalty, fulfilled in the line of David and ultimately in Jesus Christ, the King of Kings. The mention of "kings" signifies authority and leadership, pointing to the significant role her descendants will play in history. This promise is a testament to the enduring legacy of Sarah's faith and God's covenant with Abraham, which finds its ultimate fulfillment in the coming of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarai/sarah.htm">Sarai/Sarah</a></b><br>Originally named Sarai, God changes her name to Sarah, meaning "princess," signifying her role as the mother of nations and kings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch to whom God makes a covenant, promising that Sarah will bear him a son, Isaac, through whom God's promises will be fulfilled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_covenant.htm">God's Covenant</a></b><br>This event is part of the broader Abrahamic Covenant, where God promises Abraham numerous descendants and land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The promised son to be born to Sarah and Abraham, through whom the covenant will continue.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_kings.htm">Nations and Kings</a></b><br>The promise that Sarah will be the mother of nations and kings, indicating the future establishment of Israel and its monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Despite natural impossibilities, God's promises are sure.
