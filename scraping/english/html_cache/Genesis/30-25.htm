Joseph's birth marks a turning point in Jacob's life, as Rachel was the wife he loved most. Joseph would later become a central figure in the history of Israel, foreshadowing Christ in his role as a savior of his people during a time of famine. The birth of Joseph also fulfills part of God's promise to Jacob of numerous descendants.<p><b>Jacob said to Laban</b><br>Jacob's relationship with Laban is complex, characterized by mutual deception and manipulation. Laban is Jacob's uncle and father-in-law, and their relationship is marked by tension and competition. Jacob's request to leave indicates a desire to break free from Laban's control and fulfill God's promise to return to the land of his fathers. This request also reflects Jacob's growing confidence and independence.<p><b>Send me on my way</b><br>Jacob's request to be sent on his way is a formal and respectful way to ask for permission to leave. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, such a request would involve negotiations and agreements regarding property and family. Jacob's desire to leave suggests a readiness to establish his own household and fulfill his role as the patriarch of his family.<p><b>so I can return to my homeland</b><br>Jacob's longing to return to his homeland is rooted in the promises God made to him at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). The land of Canaan is the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and returning there is essential for the continuation of God's covenant.

During most of this time he would be too encumbered with pregnant wives and young children to wish to take so long a journey. (See "Excursus on Chronology of Jacob's Life.") In these thirty-four years of service there would be time for the vast increase of Laban's wealth referred to in <a href="/genesis/30-30.htm" title="For it was little which you had before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD has blessed you since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?">Genesis 30:30</a>. But at length Joseph is born, and as his other sons were most of them grown to man's estate, as soon as Rachel was fit for the journey Jacob desired to return to his father, if for no other reason, yet because now it was time to provide for his children, and at Isaac's death he was joint heir of his property.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph</span>, - either at or about the expiry of the second term of seven years. Jacob's family now consisted in all of eleven sons and one daughter, unless Dinah's birth occurred later in the next term of service (Keil). Since these were all born within seven years, the chronological cannot be the order observed by the historian in recording the events of the preceding paragraphs. Rather the births of the children are arranged in connection with the mothers from whom they sprang. Hence the possibility of acquiring so large a family in so short a time. The six sons of Leah might be born in the seven years, allowing one year's complete cessation from pregnancy, viz., the fifth; Bilhah's in the third and fourth years; Zilpah's in the beginning of the sixth and seventh; and Rachel's toward the end of the seventh, leaving Dinah to be born later (cf.
