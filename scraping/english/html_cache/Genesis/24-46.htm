In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, hospitality was a highly valued virtue. The act of lowering the jar quickly indicates her readiness to help a stranger, which aligns with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>). This gesture also foreshadows her suitability as a wife for Isaac, as it fulfills the servant's prayer for a sign of kindness and diligence (<a href="/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8216;Drink, and I will water your camels as well.&#8217;</b><br>Rebekah's offer to water the camels goes beyond the initial request for a drink, showcasing her generosity and industrious nature. Camels can drink a significant amount of water, and watering ten camels would have been a labor-intensive task. This reflects her willingness to go the extra mile, a trait that is commended in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>). Her actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers living water to all who are thirsty (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>).<p><b>So I drank,</b><br>The servant's acceptance of Rebekah's offer signifies the fulfillment of his prayer and the divine guidance in finding a wife for Isaac. This moment underscores the theme of God's providence and faithfulness in the lives of the patriarchs. It also highlights the importance of discernment and trust in God's plan, as the servant had prayed specifically for this sign (<a href="/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12-14</a>).<p><b>and she also watered the camels.</b><br>Rebekah's follow-through on her promise to water the camels demonstrates her integrity and commitment. This act of service is significant in the narrative, as it confirms her as the chosen bride for Isaac, aligning with God's covenantal promises to Abraham. The watering of the camels can be seen as a symbol of abundance and blessing, reminiscent of God's provision for His people (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).

Scripture records this event exactly as it happened, revealing the young woman&#8217;s character in real time. Her prompt movement echoes Abraham&#8217;s own quick obedience in <a href="/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6-7</a> and illustrates the virtue praised in <a href="/proverbs/31-17.htm">Proverbs 31:17</a>: &#8220;She girds herself with strength and shows that her arms are strong.&#8221; Hospitality in the ancient Near East was not optional; it was a tangible expression of righteousness (<a href="/job/31-32.htm">Job 31:32</a>). Rebekah&#8217;s swift action therefore points to a heart already trained to serve&#8212;something God values in every generation (<a href="/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8216;Drink, and I will water your camels as well.&#8217;</b><p>Her words add generosity to her gestures. Offering a stranger a sip is kind; volunteering to water ten camels (<a href="/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a>) is sacrificial. Each camel could drink many gallons, so Rebekah was volunteering for hours of labor. This mirrors Jesus&#8217; teaching about going the second mile (<a href="/matthew/5-41.htm">Matthew 5:41</a>) and aligns with <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which reminds believers to show hospitality because some have entertained angels unaware. Rebekah&#8217;s initiative fulfills Abraham&#8217;s servant&#8217;s prayer request (<a href="/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14</a>), demonstrating God&#8217;s immediate, literal answer (<a href="/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I drank</b><p>The servant&#8217;s acceptance validates Rebekah&#8217;s offer and underscores the importance of receiving graciously as well as giving (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10</a>). By drinking, he confirms the sign he requested, reinforcing that God is at work in the everyday details (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). The narrative encourages believers to recognize divine appointments when they come and to respond in simple faith, just as the servant did.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she also watered the camels.</b><p>Rebekah completes what she promised&#8212;no half-measures. Her perseverance resembles Ruth&#8217;s faithful gleaning (<a href="/ruth/2-17.htm">Ruth 2:17-18</a>) and foreshadows the diligence commended in <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>: &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being.&#8221; The camels&#8217; quenched thirst becomes visible proof that the Lord has identified the chosen bride for Isaac, ensuring the covenant line continues (<a href="/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>; 24:48). God&#8217;s providence and human obedience mesh perfectly, illustrating <a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>: &#8220;For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase in <a href="/genesis/24-46.htm">Genesis 24:46</a> spotlights God&#8217;s faithful orchestration and Rebekah&#8217;s willing, wholehearted service.

Obedience and providence operate together to advance His redemptive plan.<p>Believers today are called to the same ready, generous, follow-through kind of service, confident that the God who guided Rebekah&#8217;s steps still directs each detail of His people&#8217;s lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-46.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She quickly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;ma&#183;h&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
