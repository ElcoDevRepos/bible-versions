Jacob's preference for Joseph is evident through the "coat of many colors" (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>), a symbol of special favor. This favoritism echoes earlier family dynamics, such as Isaac's preference for Esau over Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>). The cultural context of the time placed significant importance on the firstborn son, yet Joseph, the eleventh son, received preferential treatment, which was countercultural and likely exacerbated the brothers' resentment. This favoritism foreshadows the division and conflict that will arise within the family.<p><b>they hated him</b><br>The hatred of Joseph's brothers is a direct result of the favoritism shown by Jacob. This animosity is not just personal but also reflects the broader theme of sibling rivalry found throughout Genesis, such as Cain and Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>) and Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>). The Hebrew word for "hated" indicates a deep-seated enmity, suggesting that this was not a fleeting emotion but a persistent and growing hostility. This hatred sets the stage for the brothers' later actions against Joseph, which are pivotal in the unfolding of God's plan for Israel.<p><b>and could not speak a kind word to him</b><br>The inability to speak kindly to Joseph underscores the depth of the brothers' animosity. In the cultural context, speech was a powerful tool for both blessing and cursing, and the absence of kind words indicates a complete breakdown in familial relationships. This phrase also highlights the isolation Joseph experienced within his own family, a theme that resonates with the suffering servant motif found in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. Joseph's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also rejected by His own (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>) and suffered unjustly. The brothers' inability to speak kindly foreshadows their betrayal and the subsequent trials Joseph will endure, which ultimately lead to the preservation of the family and the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, known for his dreams and future leadership in Egypt.

The brothers continually observed Jacob&#8217;s open favoritism&#8212;Joseph wearing the multicolored robe (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>). Scripture often warns that what we dwell on infiltrates our emotions (<a href="/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22-23</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>). Instead of guarding their hearts, the brothers let comparison fester.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that their father loved him more than any of them</b><p>Jacob, once wounded by his own parents&#8217; partiality (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>), repeats the pattern. Parental favoritism fractures families (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>). Love shown unevenly plants seeds of insecurity and rivalry, echoing the earlier Cain-Abel tension (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4-5</a>). God&#8217;s Word calls parents to impartial love (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-21.htm">Colossians 3:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they hated him</b><p>Unchecked jealousy matures into hatred (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>). Hatred, left to grow, leads to murderous intent (<a href="/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>), which is precisely where the brothers will head (<a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18-20</a>). Scripture reminds believers to &#8220;put off&#8221; such bitterness (<a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>) and pursue brotherly love (<a href="/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and could not speak a kind word to him</b><p>Their hearts overflowed in speech (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>).

God calls His people to bless, not curse (<a href="/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14</a>), to reconcile quickly (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>), and to speak grace-filled words (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>). The brothers&#8217; refusal set the stage for deeper sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a> portrays the tragic chain reaction of favoritism leading to jealousy, jealousy hardening into hatred, and hatred silencing kindness.
