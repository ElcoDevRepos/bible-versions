These idols were often seen as protective deities or symbols of prosperity. Jacob's family, having lived in Paddan-Aram, may have acquired these idols from their time with Laban, who himself was an idolater. The act of giving up these gods signifies a turning point for Jacob's household, a renunciation of idolatry, and a commitment to worship the one true God. This mirrors the call to monotheism that is central to the Abrahamic covenant.<p><b>and all their earrings</b><br>Earrings in ancient cultures were not merely decorative; they often held religious or superstitious significance. They could be amulets or charms associated with pagan worship. By relinquishing these items, Jacob's family was purging themselves of any remaining ties to pagan practices. This act of purification is reminiscent of later Israelite practices where physical symbols of idolatry were destroyed to maintain spiritual purity (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2-4</a>, where Aaron uses earrings to make the golden calf).<p><b>and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem</b><br>The oak near Shechem is significant both geographically and spiritually. Shechem was a central location in Canaan and held historical importance for the patriarchs. The act of burying the idols and earrings under the oak symbolizes a definitive break from past idolatry and a consecration of the family to God. Oaks were often sites of significant events or covenants in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a>, where Joshua sets up a stone under an oak as a witness to Israel's covenant with God). This burial can be seen as a type of spiritual renewal, foreshadowing the New Testament call to put away the old self and embrace a new life in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who leads his family in a spiritual renewal by removing foreign gods and purifying themselves.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreign_gods.htm">Foreign gods</a></b><br>Idols or deities that were not the God of Israel, which Jacob's family had acquired.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earrings.htm">Earrings</a></b><br>Likely associated with idolatry or pagan practices, these were also surrendered as part of the purification process.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/oak_near_shechem.htm">Oak near Shechem</a></b><br>A significant location where Jacob buried the foreign gods and earrings, symbolizing a break from past idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A city in Canaan, significant in the history of Israel, where Jacob's family had settled temporarily.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_renewal_requires_action.htm">Spiritual Renewal Requires Action</a></b><br>Jacob's leadership in removing idols demonstrates that spiritual renewal often requires decisive action and tangible steps.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_acts_of_repentance.htm">Symbolic Acts of Repentance</a></b><br>Burying the foreign gods under the oak symbolizes a complete break from past sins and a commitment to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_purification.htm">Community Purification</a></b><br>The collective act of giving up idols and earrings shows the importance of communal purity and accountability in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry's_subtlety.htm">Idolatry's Subtlety</a></b><br>The presence of foreign gods among Jacob's family serves as a reminder of how easily idolatry can infiltrate our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_of_faithfulness.htm">Legacy of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Jacob's actions set a precedent for future generations, emphasizing the importance of leaving a legacy of faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_35_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 35:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_bury_foreign_gods_near_Shechem.htm">Why did Jacob bury the foreign gods under the oak near Shechem?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_eliminate_foreign_gods_today.htm">How can we remove "foreign gods" from our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_35_4_Repentance_renewal_lesson.htm">What does Genesis 35:4 teach about repentance and renewal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_link_to_Exodus_20_3.htm">How does this verse connect to Exodus 20:3 about having no other gods?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_purify_like_Jacob_s_family.htm">What steps can we take to purify ourselves as Jacob's family did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_bury_foreign_gods_in_Genesis_35_4.htm">Why did Jacob bury foreign gods under the oak in Genesis 35:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_do_earrings_signify_in_Gen_35_4.htm">What significance do the earrings hold in Genesis 35:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_35_4_s_view_on_ancient_idolatry.htm">How does Genesis 35:4 reflect on idolatry in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_35.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 35?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/should_christians_wear_earrings.htm">Should Christians wear earrings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_body_piercings.htm">What does the Bible say about body piercings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_bought_shechem's_burial_site,_abraham_or_jacob.htm">In Acts 7:16, Stephen says Abraham bought a burial place in Shechem, yet Genesis 33:19 credits Jacob with that purchase.
