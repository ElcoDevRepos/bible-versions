Nighttime in biblical narratives often symbolizes a period of uncertainty or spiritual struggle. Jacob's actions during the night foreshadow the significant encounter he is about to have with God. This setting also reflects the urgency and secrecy of his movements, as he prepares to meet Esau, whom he fears.<p><b>Jacob got up</b><br>Jacob's rising signifies a decisive moment of action and leadership. Throughout his life, Jacob has been characterized by his cunning and resourcefulness. Here, he takes initiative, demonstrating his role as the head of his family. This action sets the stage for his transformation from Jacob, the deceiver, to Israel, the one who struggles with God.<p><b>and took his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons</b><br>Jacob's family structure reflects the customs and complexities of ancient Near Eastern society. His two wives, Leah and Rachel, and two maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, highlight the practice of polygamy and the use of concubines to bear children. The mention of his eleven sons underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham of numerous descendants. This family dynamic also foreshadows the future tribes of Israel.<p><b>and crossed the ford of the Jabbok</b><br>The Jabbok River, a tributary of the Jordan, is significant both geographically and symbolically. Crossing a river often represents a boundary or transition in biblical narratives. The Jabbok is where Jacob will wrestle with God, marking a pivotal moment in his spiritual journey. This crossing can be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing purification and preparation for a new identity. The location also connects to other biblical events where water crossings signify divine intervention and covenantal promises, such as the crossing of the Red Sea and the Jordan River.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is the grandson of Abraham and the son of Isaac.
