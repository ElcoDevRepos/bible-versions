It highlights the shift from the ease of provision in the Garden of Eden to a life of toil and labor. The "sweat of your brow" indicates hard work and effort, contrasting with the effortless abundance previously experienced. This reflects the broader biblical theme of work and its challenges, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>, where labor is described as burdensome. The necessity of labor for sustenance is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing human dependence on God for provision.<p><b>until you return to the ground&#8212;</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the mortality of humanity. The inevitability of death is introduced as a consequence of sin, marking a departure from the original design of eternal life in Eden. The phrase "return to the ground" connects to the creation account in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where man is formed from the dust of the ground. This return to the earth signifies the full circle of life and death, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>, which speaks of the spirit returning to God and the body to the earth.<p><b>because out of it were you taken.</b><br>This phrase reiterates the origin of humanity, emphasizing the intimate connection between humans and the earth. It serves as a reminder of the Creator's power and the humble beginnings of mankind. The creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> highlights God's personal involvement in forming man, setting humans apart from the rest of creation. This connection to the earth also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who, though divine, took on human form and shared in the human experience, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>.<p><b>For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase reinforces the theme of human mortality and the consequences of sin. It serves as a sobering reminder of the transient nature of life, a concept echoed in <a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14-16</a>, which speaks of human frailty. The imagery of dust symbolizes both the humble origin and the inevitable end of human life. This acknowledgment of mortality points to the need for redemption and the hope of resurrection, as fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who conquered death and offers eternal life, as proclaimed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-21.htm">1 Corinthians 15:21-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, who is directly addressed in this verse.

A spiritual being is eternal by its own constitution, but the argument by which Bishop Butler proves the soul to be immortal equally proves the mortality of the body. Death, he says, is the division of a compound substance into its component parts; but as the soul is a simple substance, and incapable of division, it is <span class= "ital">per se </span>incapable of death (<span class= "ital">Analogy, </span>Part 1, Genesis 1). The body of Adam, composed of particles of earth, was capable of division, and our first parents in Paradise were assured of an unending existence by a special gift, typified by the tree of life. But now this gift was withdrawn, and henceforward the sweat of man's brow was in itself proof that he was returning to his earth: for it told of exhaustion and waste. Even now labour is a blessing only when it is moderate, as when Adam kept a garden that spontaneously brought forth flowers and fruit. In excess it wears out the body and benumbs the soul, and by the pressure of earthly cares leaves neither time nor the wish for any such pursuits as are worthy of a being endowed with thought and reason and a soul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the sweat of thy face</span> (so called, as having there its source and being there visible) <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou eat bread</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> all food (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/job/28-5.htm">Job 28:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-15.htm">Matthew 14:15</a>; <a href="/mark/6-36.htm">Mark 6:36</a>).
