This act demonstrates courage and a willingness to reconcile. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, the head of the family or group often led the way in important encounters, signifying leadership and responsibility. Jacob's decision to go ahead of his family shows his readiness to face the consequences of his past actions, particularly the deception that led to his flight from Esau.<p><b>and bowed to the ground seven times</b><br>Bowing to the ground was a common gesture of respect and submission in ancient cultures. The act of bowing seven times is significant, as the number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible. This repeated act of bowing indicates Jacob's sincere desire for reconciliation and his acknowledgment of Esau's status. It reflects a deep humility and a recognition of the need for peace. This gesture can be seen as a type of Christ, who humbled Himself and took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>).<p><b>as he approached his brother</b><br>The approach to Esau is laden with tension and anticipation. Jacob's actions are a fulfillment of his earlier prayer for deliverance from Esau's wrath (<a href="/genesis/32-11.htm">Genesis 32:11</a>). The meeting takes place in the region of Seir, which is associated with Esau and later becomes the land of Edom. This encounter is pivotal, as it resolves a long-standing family conflict and sets the stage for the future relationship between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Edom). The reconciliation between the brothers can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate reconciliation that Christ brings between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to Canaan after years in Haran.

He endeavoured, nevertheless, by his sevenfold obeisance in acknowledgment of Esau's superiority, to propitiate him; for the cause of the quarrel had been Jacob's usurpation of Esau's right of precedence as the first born.
