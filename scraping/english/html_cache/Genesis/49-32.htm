This site is significant as it is the burial place of the patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel, including Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob. The cave and the field were initially purchased by Abraham as a family burial site, as recorded in <a href="/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>. This purchase signifies the first piece of the Promised Land owned by Abraham's descendants, symbolizing God's promise to give the land to his offspring.<p><b>were purchased from the Hittites.</b><br>The Hittites were a group of people living in the region of Canaan during the time of the patriarchs. The transaction between Abraham and Ephron the Hittite is one of the earliest recorded land purchases in the Bible, emphasizing the legal and permanent nature of the acquisition. This purchase is a testament to Abraham's faith in God's promises, as he secured a tangible piece of the land for his descendants. The Hittites, known for their advanced culture and influence in the ancient Near East, are mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often as inhabitants of the land that Israel would later possess. This transaction underscores the peaceful and respectful interactions between Abraham and the local inhabitants, contrasting with later conflicts over the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

pointing to a specific tract of ground: &#8220;The field &#8230;&#8221; Jacob is reminding his sons that they are tied to a literal piece of real estate in Canaan. Abraham had chosen that spot near Mamre (<a href="/genesis/23-17.htm">Genesis 23:17-18</a>) knowing God had already promised, &#8220;To your offspring I will give this land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). By naming the field, Jacob anchors the family&#8217;s hope to a visible, measurable portion of the promised inheritance. &#8226; A tangible pledge&#8212;Abraham had not yet seen national possession, yet he bought land confident in God&#8217;s word (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>). &#8226; A reminder of permanence&#8212;unlike a tent, a deeded field cannot be rolled up; it stands as proof that God&#8217;s covenant is not transient (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the cave that is in it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and the cave that is in it &#8230;&#8221; zeroes in on the cave of Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/23-9.htm">Genesis 23:9</a>).
