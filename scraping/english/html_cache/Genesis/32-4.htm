This reflects the tension and fear Jacob feels about reuniting with his brother, whom he had wronged years earlier by taking his birthright and blessing (Genesis 27). The act of sending messengers is a common practice in ancient Near Eastern diplomacy, used to convey messages and intentions before a personal encounter.<p><b>You are to say to my master Esau</b><br>Referring to Esau as "my master" shows Jacob's humility and desire to appease his brother. This language of submission is significant, as it contrasts with the earlier prophecy that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). Jacob's use of respectful titles is an attempt to mend their fractured relationship and avoid potential conflict.<p><b>&#8216;Your servant Jacob says</b><br>Jacob calling himself Esau's "servant" further emphasizes his attempt to reconcile and show deference. This is a reversal of the blessing he received from Isaac, where he was to be lord over his brothers (<a href="/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a>). It highlights Jacob's transformation and repentance, as he seeks peace rather than dominance.<p><b>I have been staying with Laban</b><br>Jacob's time with Laban in Haran was marked by hard labor and personal growth. He spent 20 years there, marrying Leah and Rachel and fathering many children (Genesis 29-30). This period was a time of divine shaping, as God prepared Jacob for his return to Canaan and his role in the covenant promises.<p><b>and have remained there until now</b><br>This phrase indicates the completion of a significant chapter in Jacob's life. His extended stay with Laban was part of God's plan to prosper him and fulfill the promise made to Abraham. Jacob's return to Canaan signifies a step towards the fulfillment of God's covenant, as he moves back to the land promised to his ancestors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.
