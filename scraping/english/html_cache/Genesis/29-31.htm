Leah, the elder daughter of Laban, was given to Jacob in marriage through deception, as Jacob originally loved and worked for Rachel. Leah's unloved status reflects the cultural practice of polygamy and the preference for the more beautiful or favored wife. This situation is reminiscent of God's concern for Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>, where God is described as the one who sees the afflicted. It underscores the biblical theme that God is attentive to the plight of the downtrodden and acts on their behalf.<p><b>He opened her womb</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, fertility was often seen as a sign of divine favor, and barrenness as a curse or misfortune. By opening Leah's womb, God is actively intervening in her life, granting her the ability to bear children, which was a significant source of a woman's value and security in her society. This divine intervention is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen with Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>) and Hannah (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>), where God grants children to women who were previously barren, demonstrating His power and grace.<p><b>but Rachel was barren</b><br>Rachel's barrenness sets the stage for future conflict and narrative development. It highlights the reversal of expectations, as the beloved wife is unable to conceive, while the unloved wife bears children. This situation creates tension and rivalry between Leah and Rachel, which is a recurring motif in the patriarchal narratives. Rachel's barrenness also serves as a backdrop for God's eventual intervention, as seen later in <a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22-24</a>, where God remembers Rachel and grants her a son, Joseph. This theme of barrenness followed by divine intervention is a type that points to the miraculous births in the Bible, including the birth of Jesus Christ, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The elder daughter of Laban, Leah was given to Jacob as a wife through Laban's deception.
