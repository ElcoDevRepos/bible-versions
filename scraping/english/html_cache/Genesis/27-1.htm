In biblical times, old age was often associated with wisdom and respect, yet here it also introduces a theme of deception. Isaac's blindness is both physical and symbolic, as he is unable to discern the true identity of his sons later in the chapter. This moment foreshadows the deception that will follow and reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual blindness. Isaac's condition also parallels other patriarchs, such as Jacob, who blessed his sons before his death (Genesis 49).<p><b>he called his older son Esau and said to him, &#8220;My son.&#8221;</b><br>Esau, as the firstborn, traditionally held the birthright and the primary blessing. This cultural context is crucial, as the firstborn son was expected to inherit leadership of the family and a double portion of the inheritance. Isaac's intention to bless Esau aligns with these customs, despite the earlier prophecy given to Rebekah that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). This sets the stage for the conflict between Esau and Jacob, which has roots in their prenatal struggle and Esau's earlier sale of his birthright (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>). The calling of Esau also reflects Isaac's favoritism, contrasting with Rebekah's preference for Jacob.<p><b>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; Esau replied.</b><br>Esau's response indicates readiness and obedience to his father's call, a common biblical expression of availability and respect. This phrase, "Here I am," is used by several key figures in the Bible, including Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>), often preceding significant events or divine encounters. Esau's willingness to respond to Isaac's call contrasts with his later actions and the unfolding deception. This moment underscores the tension between human plans and divine purposes, as Esau's readiness to receive the blessing is thwarted by Jacob's intervention, fulfilling God's earlier prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of the Israelite nation.

Yet God&#8217;s earlier promise concerning Jacob hovers in the background, reminding us that divine sovereignty often overrides customary norms. The verse captures a moment where human weakness, familial affection, and God&#8217;s unfolding plan intersect, preparing us for the events that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXVII.<p>JACOB BY SUBTILTY OBTAINS THE FIRSTBORN'S BLESSING.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">It came to pass.</span>--The importance of this chapter is manifest. Just as in Abraham's life the decision had to be made which of the two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, was to be the heir of the promise, so, here again, there is the same Divine election (<a href="/context/romans/9-10.htm" title="And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;">Romans 9:10-13</a>): but while Abraham obeyed, though with heavy heart (<a href="/genesis/21-11.htm" title="And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.">Genesis 21:11</a>), Isaac even struggled against God's will, and his assent was obtained by human craft working tortuously to effect that which God would have wrought in His own better way. In this case, however, the sons are more closely allied, being twins, born of the same mother, but the younger following so closely upon the very heels of the elder as to seem, even at his birth, as if in eager pursuit. They grow up strangely unlike--the one brave, active, vigorous, but indifferent to everything save earthly things. In his skill and love of hunting, Esau is the very counterpart of Ishmael. The other is calm, sedentary, keenly alive to business, devoted to domestic pursuits, but chiefly valuing the spiritual privileges for which Abraham had left his distant home, and become a wanderer in the highlands of Canaan. Thoroughly as all honest men must disapprove of the mean way in which Jacob bought the birthright, yet, at least, he valued that which Esau so despised as to sell it for the gratification of a hungry appetite. And now again the transfer is ratified by means of another unworthy artifice, but Esau this time is grieved and distressed; for at least he loved his father, and gave proof of the possession of the same warm heart that made him afterwards fall so lovingly upon his brother's neck, and kiss him with tears of hearty affection (<a href="/genesis/33-4.htm" title="And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.">Genesis 33:4</a>).<p>For Jacob, it must be said that he sought no earthly good. It was not the elder brother's share of the father's wealth that he wanted. All that was Isaac's he resigned to Esau, and went away to push his fortunes elsewhere. Even when he returned with the substance he had gotten in Padan-aram, he was no match for Esau (<a href="/genesis/33-1.htm" title="And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.">Genesis 33:1</a>), though Isaac was still living. While, too, Esau violated the family law laid down by Abraham, Jacob conformed to it. By marrying Canaanitish women, Esau forfeited by his own act the birthright which previously he had sold; for his children, being illegitimate (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm" title="Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.">Hebrews 12:16</a>), could not inherit the promise. What was utterly wrong in Rebekah's and Jacob's conduct was that they used miserable artifices to do that which should have been left to God; and Isaac was equally wrong in trying to make void and annul the clear intimation of prophecy (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.">Genesis 25:23</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old,</span> - according to the generally accepted calculation, in his one hundred and thirty-seventh year. Joseph, having been introduced to Pharaoh in his thirtieth year (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), and having been thirty-nine years of age (<a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>) when his father, aged one hundred and thirty (<a href="/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>), came down to Egypt, must have been born before Jacob was ninety-one; consequently, as his birth occurred in the fourteenth year of Jacob's sojourn in Mesopotamia (cf. <a href="/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25</a> with Genesis 29:18, 21, 27), Jacob's flight must have taken place when he was seventy-seven. But Jacob was born in Isaac's sixtieth year (<a href="/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>); hence Isaac was now one hundred and thirty-seven. There are, however, difficulties connected with this reckoning which lay it open to suspicion. For one thing, it postpones Jacob s marriage to an extremely late period. Then it takes for granted that the term of Jacob's service in Padan-aram was only twenty years (<a href="/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>), whereas it is not certain whether it was not forty, made up, according to the computation of Kennicott, of fourteen years' service, twenty years' assistance as a neighbor, and six years of work for wages. And, lastly, it necessitates the birth of Jacob's eleven children in the short space of six years, a thing which appears to some, it not impossible, at least highly improbable.
