This act symbolized the rending of the heart and the depth of emotional pain. In the biblical context, similar expressions of grief are seen in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>. The tearing of clothes is a physical manifestation of inner turmoil and despair, often associated with loss or calamity.<p><b>put sackcloth around his waist</b><br>Sackcloth was a coarse, uncomfortable material typically made from goat's hair, worn as a sign of mourning or repentance. It was a public display of humility and sorrow. The use of sackcloth is seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a> and <a href="/esther/4.htm">Esther 4:1</a>, where it signifies a period of lamentation or penitence. This practice underscores the seriousness of the situation and the depth of Jacob's grief over the perceived loss of his son, Joseph.<p><b>and mourned for his son many days</b><br>The extended period of mourning indicates the profound love Jacob had for Joseph, his favored son. In the cultural context, mourning periods could vary, but the phrase "many days" suggests an intense and prolonged grief. This mourning is reminiscent of the deep sorrow expressed by David for Absalom in <a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>. Jacob's mourning foreshadows the eventual reunion with Joseph, highlighting themes of loss and restoration. The narrative also points to the future suffering and eventual triumph of Jesus Christ, who was also deeply mourned by His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, also known as Israel.

For not only his daughters, but "all his sons rose up to comfort him." Probably he had several daughters by Leah and the two handmaidens, Dinah alone having been mentioned by name, because two of her brothers forfeited the birthright by the cruelty with which they avenged her wrong. We learn how long and intense Jacob's sorrow was from <a href="/context/genesis/45-26.htm" title="And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not.">Genesis 45:26-28</a>.
