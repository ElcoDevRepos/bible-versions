This reflects the biblical principle of headship, where the leader of a family is responsible for guiding them in spiritual matters. The context here is Jacob's return to Bethel, a place of significant spiritual encounters (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-22</a>). This directive underscores the importance of communal purity and dedication to God, especially before a significant spiritual event or journey.<p><b>Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you</b><br>The presence of foreign gods indicates syncretism, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with pagan practices. This was a common issue in the ancient Near East, where polytheism was prevalent. The foreign gods could have been household idols or teraphim, which were often used for divination or as protective talismans. This command reflects the first of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh. It also prefigures the later struggles of Israel with idolatry, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Purify yourselves</b><br>Purification rituals were common in ancient Israel and often involved washing with water, abstaining from certain activities, and sometimes offering sacrifices. This act of purification was symbolic of inner spiritual cleansing and preparation to meet God. It echoes the Levitical laws of cleanliness (Leviticus 11-15) and foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on spiritual purity (<a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). The call to purification highlights the holiness required to approach God and the need for repentance and renewal.<p><b>and change your garments</b><br>Changing garments symbolizes a transformation or renewal, often associated with a new beginning or a change in status. In biblical times, clothing was a significant indicator of one's identity and social status. This act can be seen as a metaphor for putting off the old self and putting on the new, as later articulated by Paul in <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>. It signifies leaving behind past sins and idolatry and embracing a new life dedicated to God.

The prophets pick up the theme: &#8220;Remove the filthiness of your deeds&#8230; put on your beautiful garments&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>). Paul spiritualizes it: &#8220;Put off the old self&#8230; put on the new self&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22&#8211;24</a>). Garment imagery underscores visible, sustained transformation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a> records Jacob leading his household in wholehearted repentance: abandoning idols, pursuing purity, and adopting outward signs of inward change. The verse teaches that genuine worship requires decisive separation from sin, intentional cleansing, and visible commitment to walk in newness of life&#8212;principles that echo throughout both Testaments and remain essential for every believer today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Strange gods.</span>--Besides Rachel's teraphim, many, probably, of the persons acquired by Jacob at Haran were idolaters, and had brought their gods with them. Besides these, the numerous men and women who formed the<span class= "ital">"tafs</span>" of the Shechemites were certainly worshippers of false deities. The object, then, of this reformation was not merely to raise Jacob's own family to a higher spiritual state, but also to initiate the many heathen belonging to their households into the true religion. Outward rites of purification and changes of garment were to accompany the religious teaching given, because of their symbolical value; and we can well believe that much deep and earnest religious feeling would be evoked by the solemnities which accompanied this drawing near of the whole tribe to God. This reformation is also interesting as being the first of a long series of such acts constantly recurring in the history of Israel; and especially it is parallel to the sanctification of the people at Sinai. There, also, there was the initiation not merely of the lineal Israel, but also of the mixed multitude, into the true religion--for Jacob's family had then grown into a nation; and there, also, symbolical washings were enjoined (<a href="/context/exodus/19-10.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,">Exodus 19:10-14</a>). These subsequently were still practised under the Law, and grew into the baptism by which we are now admitted into the Church of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Jacob said unto his household</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> those more immediately belonging to his family), <span class="cmt_word">and to all that were with him</span> (referring probably to the captured Shechemites), <span class="cmt_word">Put away the strange gods</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the gods of the stranger</span>, including most likely the teraphim of Laban, which Rachel still retained, and other objects of idolatrous worship, either brought by Jacob's servants from Mesopotamia, or adopted in Canaan, or perhaps possessed by the captives - <span class="cmt_word">that are among you, and be clean,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">cleanse yourselves</span>.

Aben Ezra interprets it as meaning that they washed their bodies; and Michaelis views the rite as a kind of baptism, signifying their adoption of the true religion of Jehovah - a quasi baptism of repentance, like that afterwards preached by John (vide 'Suppl.,' p. 1000) - <span class="cmt_word">and change your garments</span>.
