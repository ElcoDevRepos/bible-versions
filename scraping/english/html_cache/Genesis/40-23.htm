This position required trust and loyalty, as the cupbearer had direct access to the king. The cupbearer&#8217;s role is also seen in other biblical contexts, such as Nehemiah, who served as cupbearer to the Persian king Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>). This position often allowed for close proximity to power and influence.<p><b>however, did not remember Joseph;</b><br>Joseph had interpreted the cupbearer&#8217;s dream while they were both imprisoned, predicting his restoration to his position (<a href="/genesis/40-12.htm">Genesis 40:12-13</a>). Joseph had asked the cupbearer to remember him and mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release (<a href="/genesis/40-14.htm">Genesis 40:14</a>). The failure to remember Joseph highlights human forgetfulness and ingratitude, contrasting with God&#8217;s faithfulness and omniscience. This forgetfulness serves as a test of Joseph&#8217;s faith and patience, as he remains in prison despite his accurate interpretation of the dream.<p><b>he forgot all about him.</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the complete neglect Joseph experienced, despite his service to the cupbearer. This forgetfulness can be seen as part of God&#8217;s providential plan, as it sets the stage for Joseph&#8217;s eventual rise to power at the right time (<a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41:1-14</a>). The delay in Joseph&#8217;s deliverance is a reminder of the importance of God&#8217;s timing and the development of character through trials. This situation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and exaltation of Jesus Christ, who was also initially rejected and forgotten by those He came to save (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.
