The curse signifies a divine judgment and separation from the land, which was a source of sustenance and life. In ancient Near Eastern culture, land was integral to identity and survival, making this punishment severe. The ground, once a source of blessing, now becomes a symbol of Cain's alienation from God and community. This echoes the later Israelite experience of exile and foreshadows the spiritual separation sin causes.<p><b>which has opened its mouth to receive your brother&#8217;s blood</b><br>The imagery of the ground opening its mouth is vivid, personifying the earth as a witness to Abel's murder. Blood, in biblical terms, represents life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and Abel's blood cries out for justice (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>). This sets a precedent for the biblical theme of innocent blood crying out to God, seen in the prophets and fulfilled in the New Testament with Christ's sacrifice. The ground receiving blood also prefigures the sacrificial system where blood is shed for atonement, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus.<p><b>from your hand</b><br>This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and guilt. Cain's act was deliberate, and the phrase "from your hand" underscores the direct involvement and accountability for his brother's death. This personal culpability is a recurring biblical theme, where individuals are held accountable for their actions (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). It also contrasts with the redemptive work of Christ, who takes upon Himself the sins of humanity, offering forgiveness and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, who becomes the first murderer by killing his brother Abel.

It underscores how seriously God views the shedding of innocent blood (cf. <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, the ground was cursed because of Adam&#8217;s sin (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>). Here the curse rests on Cain himself, showing personal accountability that cannot be shifted to creation or circumstances.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs disobedience with curse and obedience with blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-28</a>). Cain is feeling the weight of that principle firsthand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and banished from the ground</b><p>&#8226; The curse has a practical outworking: Cain is &#8220;banished from the ground.&#8221; His livelihood as a farmer is shattered (compare <a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors Adam&#8217;s expulsion from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>), but is even harsher. Adam still tilled the soil; Cain will find it relentlessly unproductive.<p>&#8226; Later, Israel&#8217;s prophets warn that persistent sin leads to exile (<a href="/jeremiah/23-39.htm">Jeremiah 23:39</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>). Cain becomes an example that alienation from God brings alienation from the land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which has opened its mouth</b><p>&#8226; The ground is pictured almost like a living witness. It &#8220;opened its mouth&#8221; to drink Abel&#8217;s blood (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar imagery appears when the earth swallows Korah&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>) and when Isaiah describes Sheol enlarging its throat for the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Creation itself reacts to human sin, reverberating with either blessing or judgment (<a href="/romans/8-22.htm">Romans 8:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to receive your brother&#8217;s blood from your hand</b><p>&#8226; God links the curse directly to the crime: Abel&#8217;s blood was shed &#8220;from your hand.&#8221; Cain cannot blame jealousy, misunderstanding, or environment.<p>&#8226; Abel&#8217;s blood still &#8220;speaks&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), crying out for justice&#8212;a theme that re-echoes with the martyrs under the altar (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Innocent blood pollutes the land and demands redress (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>). That pollution is why Cain&#8217;s relationship to the soil is now fractured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a> shows God&#8217;s swift, personal judgment on murder. Cain is cursed in himself, cut off from the productive earth, and held fully responsible for Abel&#8217;s blood. The verse teaches that God values human life, that sin invites real consequences, and that creation itself bears witness to our choices.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11, 12) <span class= "bld">And now (because of thy crime) art thou cursed from the earth.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">from the adamah, o</span>r cultivated ground. Cain was the first human being on whom a curse was inflicted, and it was to rise up from the ground, the portion of the earth won and subdued by man, to punish him. He had polluted man's habitation, and now, when he tilled the soil, it would resist him as an enemy, by refusing "to yield unto him her strength." He had been an unsuccessful man before, and outstripped in the race of life by the younger son; for the future his struggle with the conditions of life will be still harder. The reason for this follows: "a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth." Restless and uneasy, and haunted by the remembrance of his crime, he shall become a wanderer, not merely in the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>his native soil, but in the earth. Poverty must necessarily be the lot of one thus roaming, not in search of a better lot, but under the compulsion of an evil conscience. Finally, however, we find that Cain's feelings grew more calm, and being comforted by the presence of a wife and children, "he builded a city," and had at last a home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Convicted, if not humbled, the culprit is speechless, and can only listen in consternation to the threefold judgment which pronounced him "<span class="accented">cursed</span> in his soul, vagabond in his body, and unprosperous in his labors" (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">And now</span> - either <span class="accented">at this time</span>, already (cf. <a href="/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>), or for <span class="accented">this cause</span>, because thou hast done this (<a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>; cf. <a href="/genesis/19-9.htm">Genesis 19:9</a>; <a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">art thou cursed.</span> <span class="accented">The first curse pronounced against a human being</span>. Adam and Eve were not cursed, though the serpent and the devil were. If we may not conclude that Cain was thereby for ever excluded from the hope of salvation if he should repent, still less must we explain the Divine judgment down to a simple sentence of banishment from Eden. The fratricide was henceforth to bear the displeasure and indignation of his Maker, whose image in Abel he had slain; of which indignation and displeasure his expatriation was to be a symbol. Different explanations have been offered of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">from the earth</span>, or <span class="accented">ground</span>, <span class="accented">Ad-</span>hamah, which, however, cannot mean <span class="accented">more than the ground</span>, which already had been cursed (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>; Lunge), since "the curse of the soil and the misery of man cannot well be compared with each other" (Kalisch); or simply <span class="accented">away from the district</span>, the scene of his crime (Kalisch, Speaker's, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Tuch, Gerlach, Delitzsch), as if all that the sentence implied was banishment from Eden; but must involve in addition the idea that the curse was to leap upon him <span class="accented">from the earth</span>, or ground, in general (Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Alford, Murphy). <span class="cmt_word">Which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand</span>.

"As robbers are wont to be who have no quiet and secure resting-place" (Calvin); driven on by the agonizing tortures of a remorseful and alarmed conscience, and not simply by "<span class="accented">the</span> earth denying to him the expected fruits of his labor" (Delitzsch). The ban of wandering, which David pronounced upon his enemies (<a href="/psalms/59-12.htm">Psalm 59:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a>), in later years fell upon the Jews, who "for shedding the blood of Christ, the most innocent Lamb of God, are vagabonds to this day over the face of the earth" (Willet). Thus the earth was made the minister of God's curse, not a partaker of it, as some have strangely imagined, as if by drinking up the blood of Abel it had become a participant of Cain's crime (Delitzsch). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
