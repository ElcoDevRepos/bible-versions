This phrase emphasizes Joseph's confidence in the interpretation given by God. Joseph's ability to interpret dreams accurately is a gift from God, highlighting his role as a prophet. This moment is a turning point in Joseph's life, as he moves from being a prisoner to a position of power in Egypt. It also demonstrates the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams, where his family would bow to him, as this interpretation sets the stage for his rise to power.<p><b>God has shown Pharaoh:</b><br>This phrase underscores the sovereignty of God over all nations and rulers, not just Israel. In the ancient Near East, dreams were often considered messages from the divine, and Pharaoh, as a ruler, would have been seen as having a special connection to the gods. However, Joseph makes it clear that it is the God of Israel who is revealing the future to Pharaoh. This revelation serves as a testament to God's control over history and His ability to communicate His plans through chosen individuals, regardless of their nationality or status.<p><b>what He is about to do:</b><br>The phrase indicates the immediacy and certainty of God's plan. The dreams of Pharaoh, interpreted by Joseph, predict seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. This prophecy not only prepares Egypt for the coming crisis but also sets the stage for the migration of Jacob's family to Egypt, which is a critical development in the history of Israel. Theologically, this demonstrates God's providence and His ability to use even adverse circumstances to fulfill His promises, such as the promise to Abraham about his descendants. This also foreshadows the coming of Christ, as Joseph's role as a savior of his people during the famine is a type of Christ, who provides spiritual salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers, later imprisoned in Egypt, and eventually rose to power as the second-in-command to Pharaoh.
