She has traveled from her home in Paddan Aram to Canaan, a significant distance, indicating her willingness to embrace God's plan. Her looking up signifies a moment of realization and anticipation, as she is about to meet her future husband, Isaac. This act of looking up can be seen as a metaphor for seeking divine guidance and being open to God's will, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>and saw Isaac</b><br>Isaac, the son of Abraham and Sarah, is a key figure in the Abrahamic covenant. His presence here fulfills the promise of a wife for him, ensuring the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants. The meeting of Isaac and Rebekah is orchestrated by God, as seen in the preceding verses where Abraham's servant prays for guidance. This encounter is a testament to God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. Isaac's role as a patriarch is crucial, and this moment foreshadows the continuation of the lineage that will lead to the nation of Israel and, ultimately, to Jesus Christ.<p><b>she got down from her camel</b><br>Rebekah's action of dismounting from her camel is culturally significant. In ancient Near Eastern customs, this gesture is one of respect and humility, often performed in the presence of someone of importance. It indicates her readiness to meet Isaac and her acceptance of the role she is about to undertake as his wife. This act of humility can be paralleled with the humility of Christ, who, though being in very nature God, took on the form of a servant. Rebekah's willingness to leave her home and embrace a new life is reminiscent of the call to follow God's leading, regardless of the uncertainties ahead.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A key figure in this passage, Rebekah is the daughter of Bethuel and the future wife of Isaac.

Her upward glance captures the essence of walking by faith, not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>- Like Abram surveying the promised land (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14&#8211;15</a>), Rebekah&#8217;s lifted eyes signal readiness to enter God&#8217;s next chapter for her life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And saw Isaac</b><p>- The meeting of bride and bridegroom fulfills Abraham&#8217;s commission to his servant (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3&#8211;4</a>).

She chooses service over self-display, stepping down from a position of height.<p>- Climactically, this humble act precedes Isaac bringing her into Sarah&#8217;s tent (<a href="/genesis/24-67.htm">Genesis 24:67</a>), underscoring that humility opens the door to blessing (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Rebekah&#8217;s lifted eyes, first sight of Isaac, and humble dismount combine to portray faith in motion: looking up in expectation, recognizing God&#8217;s chosen provision, and responding with reverent humility.
