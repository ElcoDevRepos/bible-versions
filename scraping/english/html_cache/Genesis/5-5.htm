This extended lifespan is often attributed to the pristine conditions of the early Earth, as well as the direct creation of Adam by God. The long lifespans recorded in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> serve to bridge the gap between Adam and Noah, providing continuity in the genealogical record. The ages also emphasize the effects of sin on humanity, as lifespans gradually decrease after the Flood. Theologically, Adam's long life underscores his role as the first man and the progenitor of the human race, linking him directly to the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>.<p><b>and then he died</b><br>The phrase "and then he died" is a stark reminder of the consequences of sin. In <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, God warned Adam that eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil would result in death. Adam's eventual death fulfills this divine pronouncement, illustrating the reality of spiritual and physical death introduced by sin. This phrase is repeated throughout <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, highlighting the mortality of humanity despite the long lifespans. It serves as a somber refrain that contrasts with the eternal life originally intended for humanity. Theologically, Adam's death prefigures the need for redemption and points to the hope of resurrection through Jesus Christ, who conquers death and offers eternal life to believers, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, as described in Genesis.

The simple phrase &#8220;So Adam lived&#8221; declares that the breath God breathed into him (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) sustained him for centuries. His life bridges the creation worldview of Eden and the unfolding human story outside the garden (<a href="/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25&#8211;26</a>). Adam&#8217;s continued life after the fall also displays the mercy of God, allowing time for offspring who would ultimately lead to the promised Redeemer (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a total of 930 years</b><p>Berean Standard Bible: &#8220;So Adam lived a total of 930 years&#8230;&#8221;<p>Long lifespans before the Flood are affirmed as literal numbers.

Yet even here hope glimmers: the genealogy ultimately leads to Noah, through whom God preserves life, and further on to Christ, the Last Adam who conquers death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-45.htm">1 Corinthians 15:45&#8211;57</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5</a> is more than a statistic. It records the authentic span of Adam&#8217;s life, showcases extraordinary pre-Flood longevity, and underscores the unbreakable link between sin and death. At the same time, the verse fits into a larger narrative arc that points to God&#8217;s redemptive plan: from Adam&#8217;s fall to Christ&#8217;s victory over the grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years.</span>--The numbers in the Bible are involved in great difficulty, owing to the Hebrew method of numeration being to attach numerical values to letters, and add them together; and as the words thus formed are unmeaning, they easily become corrupted. Hence there is a great discrepancy in the numbers as specified by the three main authorities, the Hebrew text making the length of time from the expulsion from Paradise to the flood 1656 years, the Samaritan text only 1307, and the LXX. 2262, while in almost all cases they agree in the duration of the lives of the several patriarchs. There is, however, an appearance of untrustworthiness about the calculations in the LXX., while the Samaritan transcript must rank as of almost equal authority with the Hebrew text itself. St. Jerome, however, says that the best Samaritan MSS. in his days agreed with the Hebrew, but none such have come down to us.<p>Not only is there no doubt that the Bible represents human life as vastly prolonged before the flood, while afterwards it grew rapidly briefer, but it teaches us that in the Messianic age life is to be prolonged again, so that a century shall be the duration of childhood, and a grown man's ordinary age shall be as the age of a tree (Isa. Ixv. 20, 22). On the other hand, we may accept the assertion of physiologists that such as man is now, a period of from 120 to 150 years is the utmost possible duration of human life, and that no strength of constitution, nor temperance, nor vegetable diet could add many years to this limit. Hence many have supposed that in the early Biblical genealogies races or dynasties were meant, or that at a time when there were only engraved cylinders or marks scratched on stones or impressed on bricks as modes of writing, a few names only were selected, each one of whom, by the length of years assigned to him, represented an indefinitely protracted period. In proof that there was something artificial in these genealogies, they point to the fact that the <span class= "ital">toldoth </span>of Adam are arranged in ten generations, and that the same number of generations composes the <span class= "ital">toldoth </span>of Shem (<a href="/context/genesis/11-10.htm" title="These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:">Genesis 11:10-26</a>).; while in our Lord's genealogy names are confessedly omitted in order to produce three series, each of fourteen names. It is also undeniable that in Hebrew genealogies it was the rule to omit names. Thus the genealogy of Moses contains only four individuals: Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/6-1.htm" title="The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.">1Chronicles 6:1-3</a>); while for the same period there are eleven descents given in the genealogy of Jehoshuah (<a href="/context/1_chronicles/7-23.htm" title="And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bore a son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.">1Chronicles 7:23-27</a>). All this is sufficient to convince every thoughtful person that we must not use these genealogies for chronological purposes. They were not drawn up with any such intention, but to trace the line of primogeniture, and show whose was the birthright. But the longevity of the antediluvian race does not depend upon these genealogies alone, but is part of the very substance of the narrative. It has too the evidence in its favour of all ancient tradition; but it is one of the mysteries of the Bible. We learn, however, from <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a> that it did not prove a blessing, and we possibly are to understand that a change took place at the time of the flood in man's physical constitution, by which the duration of his fife was gradually limited to 120 years.<p>We ought to add that modern scholarship has proved the identity of the names of the numbers up to ten in the three great families of human speech. Above ten they have nothing in common. It seems, therefore, to follow that primaeval man before the confusion of tongues had no power of expressing large numbers. Hence in these lists the generations are limited to ten, and hence too the need of caution in dealing with the mystery which underlies the protracted duration of the lives of the patriarchs.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/5-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Adam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_121.htm">Strong's 121: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adam -- the first man, also a city in the Jordan Valley</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a total of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">930</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8672.htm">Strong's 8672: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nine, ninth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and then he died.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/5-5.htm">OT Law: Genesis 5:5 All the days that Adam lived were (Gen.
