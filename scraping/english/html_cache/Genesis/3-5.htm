The serpent implies that God&#8217;s prohibition is not for protection but to prevent humans from reaching their full potential. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where temptation often involves questioning God's motives (<a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>). The phrase "in the day you eat of it" indicates immediacy, suggesting that the consequences of disobedience would be swift. This aligns with the biblical principle that sin leads to immediate spiritual death, even if physical death is delayed (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>your eyes will be opened</b><br>The promise of opened eyes suggests enlightenment or gaining new understanding. In biblical terms, "eyes being opened" often refers to gaining insight or revelation (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). However, the serpent's promise is deceptive; while Adam and Eve's eyes were indeed opened, it was to their own nakedness and shame (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>). This contrasts with the true enlightenment that comes from God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where Paul prays for the eyes of believers' hearts to be enlightened.<p><b>and you will be like God</b><br>The desire to be like God is a central theme in this temptation. It reflects the pride and ambition that led to Satan's own fall (<a href="/isaiah/14-14.htm">Isaiah 14:14</a>). The irony is that humans were already made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), but the serpent twists this truth, suggesting that disobedience would elevate them to God's level. This foreshadows humanity's ongoing struggle with pride and the desire for autonomy from God, which is addressed throughout Scripture (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<p><b>knowing good and evil</b><br>The knowledge of good and evil represents moral discernment and autonomy. Before the fall, Adam and Eve lived in a state of innocence, relying on God for moral guidance. The serpent's temptation suggests that they could independently determine right from wrong, a role reserved for God alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a>). This phrase also points to the broader biblical narrative of humanity's need for redemption and the ultimate restoration of moral order through Christ, who perfectly embodies the knowledge of good and evil (<a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_serpent.htm">The Serpent</a></b><br>A cunning creature used by Satan to tempt Eve.

It was a high bait which the tempter offered; and Eve, who at first had answered rightly, and who as yet knew nothing of falsehood, dallied with the temptation, and was lost. But we must not comment too severely upon her conduct. It was no mean desire which led her astray: she longed for more know ledge and greater perfection; she wished even to rise above the level of her nature; but the means she used were in violation of God's command, and so she fell. And, as usual, the tempter kept the promise to the ear. Eve knew good and evil, but only by feeling evil within herself. It was by moral degradation, and not by intellectual insight, that her ambitious wish was fulfilled.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x20;&#x5be;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, for because; assigning the reason <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for the devil's, statement, and so, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by implication, for the Divine prohibition) <span class="cmt_word">God doth know</span>.
