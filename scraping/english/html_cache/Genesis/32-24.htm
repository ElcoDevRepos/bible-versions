Being alone allows for introspection and vulnerability, setting the stage for a transformative experience. This moment follows Jacob's strategic planning to appease Esau, highlighting his fear and anxiety. The isolation can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual solitude, where one is stripped of distractions and forced to confront their own nature and God.<p><b>and there a man wrestled with him</b><br>The "man" is later revealed to be a divine being, often interpreted as an angel or a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. Wrestling symbolizes struggle and conflict, both physical and spiritual. This encounter reflects Jacob's lifelong struggles, including his contentious relationships with Esau and Laban. The wrestling match can be seen as a physical manifestation of Jacob's internal struggles with God and his identity.<p><b>until daybreak</b><br>The duration of the struggle, lasting until daybreak, signifies perseverance and the relentless nature of spiritual battles. Daybreak symbolizes a new beginning, enlightenment, and revelation. In biblical terms, light often represents truth and divine presence. The timing suggests that Jacob's struggle leads to a transformation, as he emerges with a new identity and blessing. This moment foreshadows the dawn of a new era in Jacob's life, marked by his name change to Israel, meaning "he struggles with God."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau. At this point in his life, Jacob is returning to Canaan after years of living with his uncle Laban. He is preparing to meet Esau, whom he fears due to their past conflict.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>This mysterious figure wrestles with Jacob throughout the night.

Taken literally, the &#8220;man&#8221; is a physical manifestation of God&#8212;often understood as the pre-incarnate Christ, the same &#8220;Angel of the LORD&#8221; who spoke to Hagar (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>) and appeared to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>).<p>&#8226; God chooses this humble human form to engage Jacob personally, foreshadowing the ultimate incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wrestled with him</b><p>&#8226; This is no dream; it is an all-night physical struggle.

The opposite idea of many modern commentators, that the narrative is an allegory, is contradicted by the attendant circumstances, especially by the change of Jacob's name, and his subsequent lameness, to which national testimony was borne by the customs of the Jews.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob was left alone</span> (probably on the north bank of the Jabbok; but <span class="accented">vide</span> on ver. 23); <span class="cmt_word">and there wrestled</span> - thus assaulting in his strong point one who had been a wrestler or heel-catcher from his youth (Murphy).
