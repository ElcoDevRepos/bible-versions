This encounter occurs after Isaac has settled in the region of Gerar, where he experienced conflict over water wells with the Philistines. The question highlights the tension between Isaac and the Philistines, who had previously shown hostility towards him. This mirrors earlier biblical narratives where patriarchs face opposition from surrounding peoples, such as Abraham's interactions with Abimelech in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. The question also underscores the theme of divine providence and reconciliation, as God often uses such encounters to fulfill His promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>&#8220;Isaac asked them.&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's direct engagement with the Philistines demonstrates his leadership and willingness to address conflict. This reflects the patriarchal role of mediating disputes and maintaining peace, a responsibility seen throughout the narratives of the patriarchs. Isaac's approach can be compared to Abraham's negotiation with God over Sodom (Genesis 18) and Jacob's later reconciliation with Esau (Genesis 33). It also foreshadows the role of Christ as a mediator, who addresses humanity's estrangement from God.<p><b>&#8220;You hated me&#8221;</b><br>The accusation of hatred points to the deep-seated animosity and jealousy the Philistines had towards Isaac, primarily due to his prosperity and God's blessing upon him. This enmity is reminiscent of Cain's hatred for Abel (Genesis 4) and foreshadows the persecution of God's people throughout biblical history. It also prefigures the world's hatred towards Christ and His followers, as Jesus warned in <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-19</a>. The theme of divine favor provoking human jealousy is a recurring motif in Scripture.<p><b>&#8220;and sent me away.&#8221;</b><br>Isaac's expulsion from Gerar by the Philistines is a significant event that echoes the experiences of other biblical figures who faced rejection. This parallels Abraham's earlier expulsion from Egypt (Genesis 12) and foreshadows Israel's future exodus from Egypt. It also prefigures Christ's rejection by His own people, as noted in <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>. The act of being sent away often serves as a catalyst for God's greater purposes, leading to the fulfillment of His promises and the expansion of His covenant blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.

The patriarch knows the recent history: he was forced out of Gerar because his prosperity stirred jealousy. This question, therefore, is not curiosity but discernment&#8212;he is testing motives, just as Paul later urges believers to &#8220;test everything&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>). The scene mirrors Abraham&#8217;s earlier encounter with another Abimelech, where a covenant conversation began only after motives were clarified (<a href="/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Isaac waits for explanation before engaging&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which cautions against answering a matter before hearing it.<p>&#8226; His tone underscores godly wisdom: peace without naivete, readiness for reconciliation without ignoring past wrongs (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Isaac asked them.</b><p>The Spirit-inspired narrative highlights Isaac&#8217;s agency. He is not passive; he initiates dialogue. Genesis repeatedly portrays covenant heads taking decisive steps&#8212;Noah building, Abraham journeying, Jacob vowing. Isaac, too, steps into his God-given role, echoing the promise in <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3&#8211;5</a> that he would inherit and steward the oath sworn to Abraham.<p>Consider:<p>&#8226; A leader&#8217;s questions can guide others toward truth (<a href="/job/38-2.htm">Job 38:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/luke/20-3.htm">Luke 20:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaac&#8217;s question sets the stage for peace talks, illustrating <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, &#8220;Blessed are the peacemakers,&#8221; even while acknowledging past hurt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You hated me</b><p>Isaac frankly names their hostility. Scripture commends truthful speech (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>). Hatred had been evident through envy that clogged wells (<a href="/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15&#8211;16</a>). Isaac&#8217;s plain words force his visitors to confront sin, much like Nathan&#8217;s rebuke to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) or Stephen&#8217;s indictment of the Sanhedrin (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p>Points to note:<p>&#8226; Sin must be identified before reconciliation can be genuine (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Acknowledging hate prepares the ground for possible repentance and covenant (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sent me away.</b><p>The expulsion from Gerar was unjust, yet God used it for Isaac&#8217;s good, multiplying his herds in the Valley of Gerar (<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12&#8211;14, 19</a>&#8211;22). By restating the wrong, Isaac highlights the contrast between human rejection and divine favor&#8212;&#8220;The LORD has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>). This recalls Joseph&#8217;s later words, &#8220;You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>Takeaways:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant blessing is not thwarted by opposition (<a href="/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers may be pushed away by the world yet drawn deeper into God&#8217;s provision (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Recounting past wrongs is not bitterness but a step toward covenant clarity, as Paul rehearsed his persecutions to show God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/26-27.htm">Genesis 26:27</a> records Isaac&#8217;s careful, candid confrontation: he invites explanation, asserts leadership, names hatred, and recalls expulsion. These words teach discernment, truthful speech, and confidence that God&#8217;s favor overrides human rejection. When opposition arises, believers can act like Isaac&#8212;seeking peace, speaking truth, and trusting the Lord who turns every exile into an opportunity for greater blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Wherefore come ye to me?</span>--Isaac's return had brought matters to a crisis, and the king must now decide whether there was to be peace or war.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>, contr, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span>, what is taught?
