His ability to discern Laban's feelings through his countenance suggests a deep understanding of human nature and relationships. In ancient Near Eastern culture, facial expressions were significant indicators of one's emotions and intentions. This moment highlights Jacob's perceptiveness, a trait that has served him throughout his life, from his dealings with Esau to his time with Laban. The countenance, or facial expression, is often used in Scripture to reveal inner thoughts and feelings, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-6</a> with Cain.<p><b>that his attitude toward him had changed.</b><br>Laban's change in attitude marks a turning point in Jacob's story. Initially, Laban welcomed Jacob warmly, seeing him as a valuable addition to his household. However, over time, as Jacob prospered and Laban's own fortunes seemed to wane, jealousy and resentment grew. This shift in attitude is a common theme in biblical narratives, where relationships are tested by prosperity and divine favor. The change in Laban's attitude can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>, where God assured Jacob of His presence and protection. This moment foreshadows the eventual departure of Jacob from Laban's household, aligning with God's plan for Jacob to return to the land of his fathers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and a key patriarch in the Bible.

Earlier he had lived twenty years under Laban&#8217;s roof, working first for Rachel and then for his own flocks (<a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18&#8211;20</a>; 30:25&#8211;30).<p>&#8226; Scripture often commends spiritual watchfulness. Jesus told His disciples, &#8220;Be on guard&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33</a>), and Paul urges believers to &#8220;watch your life and doctrine closely&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s perception prepares him for God&#8217;s instruction in the next verse: &#8220;Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>). The Lord often confirms His guidance through circumstances that sharpen our senses (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The countenance of Laban</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;from the countenance of Laban&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; A person&#8217;s face reveals the heart.

Like Saul eyeing David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-9.htm">1 Samuel 18:9</a>), Laban&#8217;s outward expression exposes inward resentment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Changed attitude</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;that his attitude toward him had changed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s earlier words sounded supportive: &#8220;I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-27.htm">Genesis 30:27</a>). Yet blessing that benefits another can stir envy (<a href="/genesis/26-14.htm">Genesis 26:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; God had promised to bless those who bless Jacob and curse those who dishonor him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; 28:15). Laban&#8217;s shift signals that remaining in Haran now conflicts with God&#8217;s covenant plan.<p>&#8226; When relationships sour despite faithful service, believers may need to move on, trusting God&#8217;s leading (<a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>; <a href="/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s discernment, coupled with divine command, sets the stage for the exodus of his household&#8212;echoing Israel&#8217;s later departure from Egypt under Moses (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-2.htm">Genesis 31:2</a> records a pivotal moment: Jacob notices Laban&#8217;s souring face and senses a deep change of heart. By staying spiritually alert, Jacob recognizes God&#8217;s cue to leave. The verse shows that facial expressions can unveil hidden motives, envy often opposes God&#8217;s favor, and the Lord uses shifting circumstances to propel His covenant people toward their ordained future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, Behold, it</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either Laban or his countenance) <span class="cmt_word">was not toward him</span> (literally, <span class="accented">with him</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>as before</span> - literally, as <span class="accented">yesterday and the day before</span>.
