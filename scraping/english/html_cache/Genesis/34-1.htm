Her mother, Leah, was Jacob's first wife, though not his preferred one, which may have influenced family dynamics. Dinah's presence in the text underscores the importance of lineage and family ties in biblical narratives. The mention of her parentage connects this story to the broader narrative of Jacob's family, which is central to the unfolding story of the Israelites. Leah's role as Dinah's mother also ties into the theme of God's providence and blessing, as Leah was blessed with many children despite being less favored by Jacob.<p><b>went out to visit the daughters of the land</b><br>Dinah's action of going out to visit the daughters of the land suggests a desire for social interaction and possibly indicates a level of integration or curiosity about the surrounding Canaanite culture. This phrase sets the stage for the subsequent events in the chapter, which involve interactions between Jacob's family and the inhabitants of Shechem. The cultural context of the time often involved strict social boundaries between different ethnic and familial groups, and Dinah's actions may reflect a breach of these norms. This visit can be seen as a precursor to the tensions between the Israelites and the Canaanites, which are a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The phrase also foreshadows the potential dangers of assimilation and the importance of maintaining distinctiveness as God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>The daughter of Jacob and Leah, Dinah is the central figure in this verse.

The verse underlines the importance of parental covering, wise associations, and constant vigilance, themes echoed throughout Scripture and vividly confirmed in Dinah&#8217;s story.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXXIV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Dinah . . . went out to see the daughters of the land.</span>--Those commentators who imagine that Jacob sojourned only twenty years at Haran are obliged to suppose that he remained two or more years at Succoth, and some eight years at Shechem, before this event happened, leaving only one more year for the interval between Dinah's dishonour and the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites. But even so, if Dinah was now not more than fourteen, there would be left a period of only nine years, in which Leah has to bear six sons and a daughter, with a long interval of barrenness, during which Zilpah was given to Jacob and bears two sons. But besides this impossibility, Jacob evidently remained at Succoth only until he was <span class= "ital">shalem, </span>sound and whole from his sprain, and Dinah's visit was one of curiosity, for she went "to see the daughters of the land," that is, she wanted, as Abravanel says, to see what the native women were like, and how they dressed themselves. Josephus says that she took the opportunity of a festival at Shechem; but as neither her father nor brothers knew of her going, but were with their cattle as usual, it is probable that with one or two women only she slipped away from her father's camp and paid the penalty of her girlish curiosity. But she would feel no such curiosity after being a year or two at Shechem, so that it is probable that her dishonour took place within a few weeks after Jacob's arrival there. So, too, Hamor's words in <a href="/context/genesis/34-21.htm" title="These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.">Genesis 34:21-22</a> plainly show that Jacob was a new comer; for he proposes that the people should "let them dwell in the land," and therefore consent to the condition required by them that the Hivites should be circumcised. It would have been absurd thus to speak if Jacob had already dwelt there eight years with no apparent intention of going away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob</span>, - if Dinah was born before Joseph (<a href="/genesis/30-21.htm">Genesis 30:21</a>) she was probably in her seventh year when Jacob reached Succoth (<a href="/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>); but it does not follow that she was only six or seven years of age when the incident about to be described occurred (Tuch, Bohlen). If Jacob stayed two years at Succoth and eight in Shechem (Petavius), and if, as is probable, his residence in Shechem terminated with his daughter's dishonor (Lange), and if, moreover, Joseph s sale into Egypt happened soon after (Hengstenberg), Dinah may at this time have been in her sixteenth or seventeenth year (Kurtz). Yet there is no reason why she should not have been younger, say between thirteen and fifteen (Keil, Lange, Kalisch, Murphy, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), since in the East females attain to puberty at the age of twelve, and sometimes earlier (Delitzsch) - <span class="cmt_word">went out</span> - it is not implied that this was the first occasion on which Dinah left her mother's tent to mingle with the city maidens in Shechem: the expression is equivalent to "once upon a time she went <span class="accented">out"</span> (Hengstenberg) - <span class="cmt_word">to see the daughters of the land</span> - who were gathered at a festive entertainment (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 1:21, 1), a not improbable supposition (Kurtz), though the language rather indicates the paying of a friendly visit (Lange), or the habitual practice of associating with the Shechemite women (Bush), in their social entertainments, if not in their religious festivals. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Dinah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#238;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1783.htm">Strong's 1783: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dinah -- daughter of Jacob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the daughter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1323.htm">Strong's 1323: </a> </span><span class="str2">A daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Leah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3812.htm">Strong's 3812: </a> </span><span class="str2">Leah -- 'weary', a wife of Jacob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had borne</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Jacob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
