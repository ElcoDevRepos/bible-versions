The emphasis on "out of the ground" connects to <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God forms man from the dust, underscoring the theme of life emerging from the earth. The trees being "pleasing to the eye" suggests God's intention for beauty and aesthetic enjoyment in creation, reflecting His nature as a God of order and beauty. "Good for food" indicates God's provision for sustenance, aligning with His role as a provider. This provision is echoed in <a href="/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>, where God gives plants for food. The abundance and variety of trees also symbolize the richness of God's creation, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>, which speaks of God providing for all living things.<p><b>And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</b><br>The placement of these trees "in the middle of the garden" signifies their central importance. The "tree of life" represents eternal life and is a recurring symbol in Scripture, appearing again in <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a> as part of the new creation, indicating its role in God's redemptive plan. The "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" introduces the concept of moral choice and free will, setting the stage for the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This tree symbolizes the boundary set by God, highlighting the theme of obedience and the consequences of disobedience. The dual presence of these trees reflects the tension between life and death, blessing and curse, a theme that runs throughout the Bible, culminating in the choice between life and death presented in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>.

The verse reassures us of the Creator&#8217;s generosity, love of beauty, and desire for relationship, while reminding us that real life flows from choosing His way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food.</span>--It has often been noticed that while the ancients do not seem to have had much taste for the beauty of the landscape, they greatly admired large and umbrageous trees. This feeling seems like a reminiscence of the joy of our first parents when they found themselves in a happy garden, surrounded by trees, the beauty of which is even more commended than the fact placed second, that they supplied wholesome and nutritious food. Two trees in the centre of the garden had marvellous qualities; for "the tree of life" ad the power of so renewing man's physical energies that his body, though formed of the dust of the ground, and therefore naturally mortal, would, by its continual use, live on for ever. The other, "the tree of knowledge of good and evil," must have acquired this name after the fall. As long as Adam and Eve were in their original innocence they had no knowledge of evil, nor could any mere mental development bestow it upon them. They must either feel it in themselves, or see it in others, before they could know it. We conclude, then, that this was the tree to which God's command, that they should not eat of it (comp. <a href="/genesis/3-3.htm" title="But of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.">Genesis 3:3</a>), was attached; and only by the breach of that command would man attain to this higher knowledge, with all the solemn responsibilities attached to it. Besides this each tree had a symbolic meaning, and especially the tree of life (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm" title="He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm" title="In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.">Revelation 22:2</a>). The Chaldean legends have preserved the memory of this latter tree, and depict it as the <span class= "ital">Asclepias acida, </span>whence the <span class= "ital">soma </span>juice is prepared.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And out of the ground made the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight</span> - literally, lovely to see; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> beautiful in form and color - <span class="cmt_word">and good for food</span>. In the preparation of man's pristine abode respect was had to ornamentation as well as utility. Every species of vegetation that could minister to his corporeal necessities was provided. Flowers, trees, and shrubs regaled his senses with their fragrance, pleased his eye with their exquisite forms and enchanting colors, and gratified his palate with their luscious fruits. Hence the garden of the Lord became the highest ideal of earthly excellence (<a href="/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). In particular it was distinguished by the presence of two trees, which occupied a central position among its multifarious productions. <span class="cmt_word">The tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span> That these were not two separate trees, but only one tree distinguished by different names, has been maintained, though with no weightier reason than the statement of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-3.htm">Genesis 3:3</a>. The opinion of Witsius, Luther, Kennicott, and Hengstenberg, that classes of trees, and not individual trees, are meant by the phrases "tree of life" and "tree of knowledge," is precluded by the language of Jehovah Elohim in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>. As regards their significance, consistency requires that they should both be explained on the same principle. This, accordingly, disposes of the idea that the tree of life (literally, the tree of the lives: cf. <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; 20:19) is simply a Hebraism for <span class="accented">a living tree</span>, as by no sort of ingenuity can the tree of knowledge be transformed into <span class="accented">a knowing tree</span>. It likewise militates against the notion that the two trees were styled from the peculiar effects of their fruits, the one conferring physical immortality on Adam's body (Scotus, Aquinas, Fairbairn, Kalisch, Luther), and the other imparting moral and intellectual intuitions to his soul (Josephus, Kalisch). But even if the life-giving properties of the one tree could be demonstrated from <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>, proof would still be required with regard to the other, that the mere physical processes of manducation and digestion could be followed by results so immaterial as those of "rousing the slumbering intellect, teaching reason to reflect, and enabling the judgment to distinguish between moral good and moral evil" (Kalisch). Besides, if this was the immediate effect of eating the forbidden fruit, it is difficult to perceive either why it should have been prohibited to our first parents at all, it being "for their good to have their wits sharpened" (Willet); or in what respect they suffered loss through listening to the tempter, and did not rather gain (Rabbi Moses); or wherein, being destitute of both intellectual and moral discernment, they could be regarded as either guilty of transgression or responsible for obedience. Incapacity to know good and evil may be a characteristic of unconscious childhood and unreflecting youth (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>), or of debilitated age (<a href="/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>), but is not conceivable in the case of one who was created in God's image, invested with world-dominion, and himself constituted the subject of moral government. Unless, therefore, with ancient Gnostics and modern Hegelians, we view the entire story of the probation as an allegorical representation of the necessary intellectual and ethical development of human nature, we must believe that Adam was acquainted with the idea of moral distinctions from the first. Hence the conclusion seems to force itself upon our minds that the first man was possessed of both immortality and knowledge irrespective altogether of the trees, and that the tree character which belonged to these trees was symbolical or sacramental, suggestive of the conditions under which he was placed in Eden. "Arbori autem vitae nomen indidit, non quod vitam homini conferrer, qua jam ante praeditus erat; sod ut symbolum ac memoriale esset vitae divinitus acceptae" (Calvin).
