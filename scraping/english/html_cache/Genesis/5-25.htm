His age at fatherhood, 187 years, reflects the extended lifespans before the Flood, a period characterized by longevity. This longevity is often attributed to the pre-Flood environment, which some suggest was more conducive to long life. Methuselah's name is sometimes interpreted as "man of the dart" or "his death shall bring," which some scholars see as prophetic, as his death coincides with the year of the Flood. His age at this point also highlights the generational continuity leading to Noah.<p><b>he became the father of Lamech</b><br>Lamech, Methuselah's son, is part of the genealogy leading to Noah, who plays a crucial role in the biblical narrative of the Flood. This genealogy is significant as it traces the lineage from Adam to Noah, emphasizing the preservation of the righteous line through which God would continue His covenantal promises. Lamech's name means "powerful" or "strong," and he is the father of Noah, who would be instrumental in God's plan to preserve humanity and the animal kingdom through the ark. This lineage underscores the theme of divine providence and the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, which ultimately points to Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of God's promise to redeem humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/methuselah.htm">Methuselah</a></b><br>Known as the longest-lived human in the Bible, Methuselah is a significant figure in the genealogy from Adam to Noah.

Possibly he had nothing but a dim, vague expectation of some good thing - the destruction of sinners in the Flood (Chrysostom), the use of the plough (R. Solomon), the grant of animal food (Kalisch), the invention of the arts and implements of husbandry (Sherlock, Bush) - that God was about to bestow upon his weary heritage; or at most a hope that the promise would be fulfilled in his son s day (Bonar), if not in his son himself (Calovius).
