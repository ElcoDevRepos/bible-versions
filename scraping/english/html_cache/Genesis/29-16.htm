His role in the story is significant as he becomes Jacob's father-in-law. The mention of Laban having two daughters sets the stage for the unfolding events in Jacob's life, particularly his marriages and the subsequent birth of the twelve tribes of Israel. The number two often signifies witness or testimony in biblical numerology, which may foreshadow the important roles these daughters will play in the history of Israel.<p><b>the older was named Leah,</b><br>Leah, the elder daughter, is introduced first, which is significant in the cultural context of primogeniture, where the firstborn typically holds a place of honor and inheritance. Her name, meaning "weary" or "delicate," may reflect her life experiences and the challenges she faces. Leah's role in the biblical narrative is crucial as she becomes the mother of six of the twelve tribes of Israel, including Judah, from whom the line of David and ultimately Jesus Christ descends. This connection highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and grace, as Leah, though less favored, is chosen to be part of the Messianic lineage.<p><b>and the younger was named Rachel.</b><br>Rachel, the younger daughter, is introduced with a name meaning "ewe," symbolizing beauty and gentleness. Her introduction as the younger sets up the tension in the narrative, as Jacob's love for her becomes a central theme. Rachel's beauty and Jacob's affection for her are pivotal in the story, leading to the complex family dynamics and the eventual birth of Joseph and Benjamin. Rachel's life and struggles, including her initial barrenness, echo the experiences of other matriarchs like Sarah and Rebekah, emphasizing themes of faith, patience, and God's providence. Rachel's connection to Joseph, a type of Christ, further underscores her importance in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah and the father of Leah and Rachel. He plays a significant role in the account of Jacob, as he becomes Jacob's father-in-law and employer. Laban is known for his cunning and manipulative behavior, which is evident in his dealings with Jacob.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>Leah is the older daughter of Laban. She becomes Jacob's first wife through Laban's deception. Leah is described as having "weak eyes," which some interpret as a lack of physical beauty compared to her sister Rachel. Despite this, Leah becomes the mother of six of the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>Rachel is the younger daughter of Laban and is described as beautiful and well-favored. Jacob falls in love with Rachel and agrees to work for Laban for seven years to marry her. Rachel becomes Jacob's second wife and the mother of Joseph and Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, Jacob is a central figure in this account. He is the son of Isaac and Rebekah and the grandson of Abraham. Jacob's journey to Laban's household marks a significant period in his life, where he experiences both love and deception.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>This is the region where Laban and his family reside. It is significant as the place where Jacob flees to escape his brother Esau's wrath and where he meets his future wives, Leah and Rachel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_family_dynamics.htm">God's Sovereignty in Family Dynamics</a></b><br>Despite human manipulation and favoritism, God's purposes prevail.

Firstborn rights, later codified in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>, normally belonged to the elder child; this cultural backdrop explains why Laban insists that Leah marry first (<a href="/genesis/29-26.htm">Genesis 29:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s introduction prepares us for her poignant story of longing for love (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32&#8211;35</a>). Despite Jacob&#8217;s preference for Rachel, God honors Leah with six sons&#8212;including Judah, forefather of King David and ultimately Jesus (<a href="/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18&#8211;22</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s very presence underscores a recurring biblical pattern: the seemingly overlooked person becomes central to God&#8217;s redemptive plan (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the younger was named Rachel.</b><p>&#8226; Rachel enters as the sister whom Jacob will love at first sight (<a href="/genesis/29-17.htm">Genesis 29:17&#8211;18</a>).

By naming Laban&#8217;s two daughters and specifying their birth order, the verse sets the stage for pivotal events: marriage negotiations, rivalry, and the birth of tribes through whom God advances His covenant. Leah and Rachel, each in her own way, display the Lord&#8217;s sovereign choice and faithful provision, reminding us that every detail in Scripture carries purpose in God&#8217;s unfolding, literal plan of redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban had two daughters</span> (the wife of Laban is not mentioned in the story): <span class="cmt_word">the name of the elder was Leah</span>, - "Wearied" (Gesenius);
