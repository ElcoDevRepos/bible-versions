It follows the birth of several sons to Leah, highlighting the ongoing expansion of Jacob's lineage. The phrase suggests a sequence, emphasizing the unfolding of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants.<p><b>Leah gave birth to a daughter</b><br>Leah, Jacob's first wife, had previously borne him six sons. The birth of a daughter, Dinah, is significant as it marks a departure from the focus on male heirs. In the cultural context of the time, daughters were often less emphasized in genealogical records, yet Dinah's mention here foreshadows her later involvement in a pivotal narrative in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<p><b>and named her Dinah.</b><br>The name Dinah means "judged" or "vindicated," which may reflect Leah's feelings of justification or hope for justice in her relationship with Jacob and her sister Rachel. The naming of Dinah is significant, as names in the Bible often carry prophetic or symbolic meanings. Dinah's story later in Genesis involves themes of justice and retribution, aligning with the meaning of her name. Her narrative also connects to broader themes of family dynamics and God's providence in the lives of the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is the mother of Dinah.
