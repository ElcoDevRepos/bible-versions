It marks a specific, divinely appointed time when God's instructions were fulfilled. The phrase underscores the precision of God's timing, reflecting His sovereignty and control over the unfolding of events. This moment is a culmination of Noah's obedience and God's patience, as referenced in <a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>, where God declares a 120-year period before the flood.<p><b>Noah entered the ark</b><br>Noah's entry into the ark signifies his faith and obedience to God's command. <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a> highlights Noah's faith as he acted on things not yet seen, building the ark in reverence. The ark itself is a type of Christ, providing salvation and refuge from judgment, as Christ does for believers. The act of entering the ark symbolizes entering into God's provision and protection.<p><b>along with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth</b><br>The inclusion of Noah's sons indicates the continuation of humanity through Noah's lineage. Shem, Ham, and Japheth are significant as they become the progenitors of the post-flood nations, as detailed in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. This phrase also highlights the importance of family in God's plan, as Noah's household is preserved due to his righteousness.<p><b>and his wife</b><br>Noah's wife, though unnamed, plays a crucial role in the preservation of humanity. Her presence signifies the importance of marital unity and partnership in fulfilling God's purposes. The inclusion of Noah's wife also reflects the biblical pattern of family units being central to God's covenantal promises.<p><b>and the three wives of his sons</b><br>The mention of the sons' wives ensures the propagation of the human race after the flood. This detail underscores the completeness of God's provision for the future of humanity. The presence of these women also highlights the role of women in God's redemptive history, as they are essential for the continuation of life and the fulfillment of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve human and animal life.

Not inconsistent with vers. 4, 5, which do not necessarily imply that the actual entry was made seven days before the Flood; but merely that Noah then began to carry out the Divine instructions. The threefold recital of the entry - first in connection with the invitation or command (ver. 5), and again in the actual process during the seven days (ver. 7), and finally on the day when the Flood began (ver. 15), - besides lending emphasis to the narrative, heightens its dramatic effect. <span class="cmt_word">They, and every beast after his Mad, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort</span> (literally, <span class="accented">wing</span>).

The last clause, <span class="accented">kol-canaph</span>, Kalisch, following Clericus, translates, though, according to Rosenm&uuml;ller, without satisfactory reasons, "every winged creature," and so makes "three classes of winged beings - the eatable species (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>), the birds which people the air and enliven it by the sounds of their melodies (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>), and the endless swarms of insects (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>), the greatest part of which possess neither the utility of the former nor the beauty of the latter.
