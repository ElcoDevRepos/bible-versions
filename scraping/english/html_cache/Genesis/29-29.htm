This practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as when Pharaoh gave Hagar to Sarah (<a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>). Bilhah's role as a servant girl is significant, as she later becomes a concubine to Jacob and the mother of two of the tribes of Israel, Dan and Naphtali (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3-8</a>). This reflects the social and familial structures of the time, where servants could play crucial roles in the family lineage.<p><b>to his daughter Rachel</b><br>Rachel, the younger daughter of Laban, is a central figure in the Genesis narrative. Her marriage to Jacob is marked by love and preference, as Jacob worked fourteen years to marry her (<a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18-30</a>). Rachel's relationship with her sister Leah and her struggle with infertility are key themes in her story. The giving of Bilhah to Rachel underscores the importance of family alliances and the continuation of lineage, as Rachel later uses Bilhah to bear children on her behalf.<p><b>as her maidservant</b><br>The term "maidservant" indicates a position of servitude but also of trust and responsibility within the household. Maidservants could be elevated to the status of concubines, as seen with Bilhah and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant. This reflects the patriarchal society where women's roles were often defined by their relationships to men and their ability to bear children. The use of maidservants to bear children for their mistresses is a recurring theme in Genesis, highlighting the cultural practices surrounding inheritance and family legacy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah and the father of Leah and Rachel.

Earlier, Laban offered Leah with Zilpah (<a href="/genesis/29-24.htm">Genesis 29:24</a>: &#8220;And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant.&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;also gave&#8221; shows a pattern&#8212;Laban repeats the custom for Rachel, underscoring his control of the marriage arrangements.<p>&#8226; In ANE culture, a father customarily sent attendants with a bride (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-59.htm">Genesis 24:59</a>). Here, however, Laban&#8217;s gifting functions as another layer in his ongoing manipulation of Jacob&#8217;s household, pre-positioning people who will keep Laban&#8217;s influence alive even after the wedding.<p>&#8226; Behind the human scheming, God&#8217;s providence is quietly at work (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>); what looks like Laban&#8217;s maneuvering will become part of God&#8217;s larger plan to build the twelve tribes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his servant girl Bilhah</b><p>Bilhah&#8217;s name now enters biblical history.<p>&#8226; Though labeled &#8220;servant girl,&#8221; she will later be called &#8220;Jacob&#8217;s wife&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-4.htm">Genesis 30:4</a>), reminding us that in Scripture every individual&#8212;slave or free&#8212;possesses dignity before God (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Bilhah will mother Dan and Naphtali (<a href="/genesis/35-25.htm">Genesis 35:25</a>). Her presence at this moment sets in motion events decades ahead, showing how God can weave even a household servant into covenant purposes.<p>&#8226; Like Hagar earlier (<a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>), Bilhah embodies the complicated family dynamics that arise whenever people seek solutions outside divine timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to his daughter Rachel</b><p>Rachel, beloved by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18-20</a>), receives Bilhah as part of her wedding provision.<p>&#8226; The gift looks generous yet binds Rachel closer to her father&#8217;s interests; Bilhah&#8217;s loyalty is first to Laban.<p>&#8226; Rachel&#8217;s infertility (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>) will push her to rely on this servant, illustrating how impatience with God&#8217;s schedule can open doors to rivalry and sorrow (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, God will show compassion toward Rachel (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>), proving that His mercy overrides family schemes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as her maidservant</b><p>The title clarifies Bilhah&#8217;s role: personal attendant and potential surrogate.<p>&#8226; Culturally, a barren wife could present her maid to her husband so the wife might &#8220;build up&#8221; children through her (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3</a>; echoing Sarah&#8217;s plan with Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records the practice without endorsing it; the later strife between Leah, Rachel, and their maidservants (<a href="/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a>) warns of the heartache that follows human shortcuts.<p>&#8226; Even so, God sovereignly folds the sons of maidservants into Israel&#8217;s tribal structure (<a href="/genesis/49-16.htm">Genesis 49:16-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-22.htm">Deuteronomy 33:22</a>), displaying His redemptive authority over flawed human decisions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/29-29.htm">Genesis 29:29</a> marks more than a household staffing note; it signals Laban&#8217;s calculated influence, introduces Bilhah&#8217;s pivotal future, highlights Rachel&#8217;s looming struggle with barrenness, and sets the stage for surrogate motherhood that will shape Israel&#8217;s tribes.
