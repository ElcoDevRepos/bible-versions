This behavior is consistent with Laban's earlier actions, such as deceiving Jacob into marrying Leah before Rachel. The number "ten" is often used in the Bible to signify completeness or fullness, suggesting that Laban's actions were thoroughly unjust. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human deceit and the challenges faced by God's people. The cultural context of the time allowed for such agreements to be made verbally, and Laban's repeated changes would have been seen as a serious breach of trust.<p><b>God has not allowed him to harm me</b><br>Despite Laban's attempts to exploit Jacob, God's protection over Jacob is evident. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of divine providence and protection. It echoes the promise God made to Jacob at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>), where God assured him of His presence and protection. This divine safeguarding is a recurring theme in the lives of the patriarchs, as seen in the protection of Abraham and Isaac. It also foreshadows the New Testament assurance of God's protection over believers, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"
