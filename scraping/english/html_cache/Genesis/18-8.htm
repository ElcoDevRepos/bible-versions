The offering of curds and milk, along with a prepared calf, indicates a meal of high quality, suggesting respect and honor towards the guests. The preparation of a calf, a costly and time-consuming endeavor, underscores Abraham's willingness to serve generously. This act of hospitality is reminiscent of the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law, where offerings were made to honor God. The meal can also be seen as a type of fellowship offering, symbolizing peace and communion.<p><b>and he set them before the men</b><br>Abraham's act of setting the food before the men demonstrates humility and servitude. In the context of <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, these "men" are later revealed to be the LORD and two angels. This encounter prefigures theophanies, where God appears in human form, and points to the incarnation of Christ, who would later dwell among humanity. The act of serving these divine visitors foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus serves His disciples, establishing a new covenant.<p><b>and stood by them under the tree as they ate</b><br>Abraham's position of standing by while his guests ate is indicative of a servant's role, emphasizing his humility and readiness to attend to any further needs. The setting under the tree provides a natural and serene environment, possibly an oak or terebinth, which were common in the region and often associated with significant biblical events. This scene under the tree can be seen as a precursor to the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus prayed before His crucifixion, highlighting themes of service, sacrifice, and divine encounter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

Neither the Hebrews, Greeks, nor Romans knew how to make butter, and the word itself signifies cheese made of cows' milk. This is less prized in the East than that made from the milk of sheep, or of goats, while camels' milk is regarded by the Arabs as best for drinking. In a hot climate milk is more refreshing when slightly sour; but Abraham brought both fresh milk (probably from the camels) and sour milk (from the sheep), and this with the cakes and the calf made a stately repast. With noble courtesy "he stood by them, and they did eat." The Targum of Jonathan and other Jewish authorities translate "and they made show of eating," lest it should seem as though angels ate (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD.

Not seemed to eat (Josephus, Philo, Jonathan), nor simply ate after an allegorical fashion, as fire consumes the materials put into it (Justin Martyr), but did so in reality (Tertullian, Delitzsch, Keil, Kurtz, Lange). Though the angel who appeared to Manoah (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>) refused to partake of food, the risen Savior ate with his disciples (<a href="/luke/24-43.htm">Luke 24:43</a>).

and the acceptance of Abraham's hospitality on the part of Jehovah and his angels may in like manner have been designed to prove that their visit to his tent at Mamre was not a dream or a vision, but a genuine external manifestation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/18-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Abraham brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
