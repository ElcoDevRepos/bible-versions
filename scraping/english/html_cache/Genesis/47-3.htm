In Egyptian society, shepherds were generally looked down upon, as Egyptians considered sheep unclean. This question also reflects the importance of work and identity in the biblical narrative, where one's occupation often signifies one's role and purpose. The inquiry by Pharaoh can be seen as a test of character and honesty, as well as a means to understand the newcomers' place in the Egyptian social hierarchy.<p><b>Pharaoh asked Joseph&#8217;s brothers.</b><br>This interaction highlights the favor Joseph had with Pharaoh, allowing his family direct access to the ruler of Egypt. It underscores Joseph's elevated status and the trust Pharaoh placed in him. The presence of Joseph's brothers before Pharaoh fulfills the earlier dreams Joseph had, where his family would bow to him, indicating his leadership and God's providence in their lives. This moment also sets the stage for the Israelites' settlement in Egypt, which is a pivotal development in the biblical narrative.<p><b>&#8220;Your servants are shepherds,&#8221; they replied,</b><br>The brothers' response is straightforward and honest, acknowledging their humble occupation. This admission aligns with their identity and heritage, as shepherding was a common occupation among the patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The term "servants" reflects a posture of humility and respect towards Pharaoh, recognizing his authority. This response also foreshadows the Israelites' future as a distinct people within Egypt, maintaining their cultural and occupational identity.<p><b>&#8220;both we and our fathers.&#8221;</b><br>By mentioning their fathers, the brothers emphasize the continuity and tradition of their occupation, linking themselves to their ancestral heritage. This connection to their forefathers highlights the importance of family and tradition in the biblical narrative. It also serves as a reminder of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reinforcing the idea that the Israelites are a chosen people with a distinct purpose. This phrase underscores the theme of faithfulness to one's heritage and the enduring nature of God's promises throughout generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who holds significant power and authority.

In this meeting, livelihoods determine where Joseph&#8217;s family will live and how they will relate to Egypt. Similar moments of identity-revealing questions surface throughout Scripture&#8212;God asking Adam, &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>) or Jesus asking the blind men, &#8220;What do you want Me to do for you?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/20-32.htm">Matthew 20:32</a>).
