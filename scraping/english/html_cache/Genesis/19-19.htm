Lot acknowledges the grace and mercy he has received, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the lives of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>). The concept of finding favor is often associated with divine intervention and blessing.<p><b>and you have shown me great kindness by sparing my life</b><br>Lot recognizes the mercy extended to him by the angels sent by God. This act of kindness is a demonstration of God's covenant faithfulness, similar to His protection of Israel throughout the Old Testament. The sparing of Lot's life prefigures the salvation offered through Jesus Christ, who spares believers from eternal death (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>But I cannot run to the mountains</b><br>Lot's reluctance to flee to the mountains may indicate a lack of faith or fear of the unknown. Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize places of refuge or divine encounter, such as Mount Sinai (Exodus 19) and the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>). Lot's hesitation contrasts with the faith of Abraham, who willingly journeyed to the mountains in obedience to God (<a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>).<p><b>the disaster will overtake me, and I will die</b><br>Lot expresses fear of impending judgment, which reflects the broader biblical theme of divine retribution for sin. This disaster is a direct consequence of the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, illustrating the principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). Lot's plea underscores the urgency of repentance and the need for divine protection, themes echoed in the prophetic warnings throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>The nephew of Abraham, Lot is the central figure in this verse.

Lot begins with humility, calling himself &#8220;your servant,&#8221; acknowledging the angels&#8217; authority and God&#8217;s sovereign grace (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Favor&#8221; echoes the same idea Noah experienced (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>), underscoring that deliverance always starts with God&#8217;s unearned kindness.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows that Lot recognizes this rescue is not coincidence but covenant mercy, just as Paul later notes that salvation is &#8220;by grace&#8230;not by works&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have shown me great kindness by sparing my life</b><p>&#8226; Lot identifies the kindness: physical preservation. Like Israel at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>) and Rahab in Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-22.htm">Joshua 6:22-25</a>), he sees that God intervenes in judgment to protect His own.<p>&#8226; The emphasis on &#8220;life&#8221; reminds us that God values life and keeps His promises to Abraham about Lot&#8217;s safety (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23-33</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Great kindness&#8221; anticipates the theme of God&#8217;s hesed&#8212;steadfast love&#8212;celebrated in <a href="/bsb/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I cannot run to the mountains</b><p>&#8226; Here Lot&#8217;s faith wavers. Though saved, he fears the practical challenge of reaching the mountains, reflecting human weakness like Elijah&#8217;s flight (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; His request shows that believers can still struggle with trust after experiencing God&#8217;s power (<a href="/mark/9-24.htm">Mark 9:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The mountains were the angels&#8217; stated refuge (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>), so his reluctance reveals partial obedience&#8212;often a source of unnecessary trouble (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The disaster will overtake me</b><p>&#8226; Lot assumes the judgment&#8217;s timing could outpace him. This parallels Israel&#8217;s fear at the edge of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/14-1.htm">Numbers 14:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; His language acknowledges the certainty and swiftness of divine wrath, echoing Jesus&#8217; warning that end-time judgment comes &#8220;like lightning&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;overtake&#8221; indicates that judgment is unavoidable unless one is in the place of God-appointed safety&#8212;a truth later echoed in <a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3</a>: &#8220;How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I will die</b><p>&#8226; Lot&#8217;s concluding anxiety spotlights the wages of sin&#8212;death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Even after being spared once, he senses that apart from continued obedience he remains vulnerable, much like the Israelites who perished in the wilderness after initial deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-12</a>).<p>&#8226; His fear pushes him to ask for refuge in Zoar (<a href="/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>), illustrating that God often accommodates our frailty while still accomplishing His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-19.htm">Genesis 19:19</a> records Lot&#8217;s grateful yet fearful response to God&#8217;s rescuing mercy.
