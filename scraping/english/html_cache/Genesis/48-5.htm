Their birth in Egypt signifies the beginning of Israel's connection to this land, which would later become a place of both refuge and bondage for the Israelites. The mention of "before I came to you here" underscores the separation between Jacob and Joseph, emphasizing the divine orchestration in reuniting the family. This separation and reunion foreshadow the future exodus of the Israelites from Egypt.<p><b>shall be reckoned as mine;</b><br>Jacob's declaration that Joseph's sons will be "reckoned as mine" is significant in the context of inheritance and tribal identity. By adopting Ephraim and Manasseh as his own, Jacob elevates them to the status of his direct sons, ensuring they receive a portion of the inheritance. This act is a legal and formal adoption, which was a recognized practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It also reflects the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing and blessing whom He wills, as seen throughout the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine,</b><br>The naming of Ephraim and Manasseh is crucial, as it sets the stage for their roles in the history of Israel. Ephraim, though the younger, is often placed before Manasseh, indicating a reversal of the traditional birthright, a recurring theme in Genesis (e.g., Jacob over Esau). This foreshadows the prominence of the tribe of Ephraim in the later history of Israel, as it becomes one of the leading tribes in the Northern Kingdom. The adoption of these two sons also symbolizes the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community, as their mother was Egyptian.<p><b>just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.</b><br>By equating Ephraim and Manasseh with Reuben and Simeon, Jacob is not only adopting them but also granting them equal status with his firstborn sons. Reuben, as the firstborn, traditionally held the birthright, but due to his transgressions (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>), he lost this privilege. Simeon, too, had a diminished role due to his actions (Genesis 34). This comparison highlights the theme of grace and the reordering of expectations, as God often chooses the unexpected to fulfill His purposes. This act of adoption and blessing prefigures the New Testament concept of believers being adopted into God's family through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob is nearing the end of his life and is blessing his descendants.

The phrase signals a deliberate, Spirit-led moment, similar to when Moses says &#8220;And now&#8221; before covenant instructions (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>). Jacob is about to confer covenant blessing in real time, underscoring that God&#8217;s faithfulness in the past governs today&#8217;s choices (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your two sons born to you in Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s boys, Ephraim and Manasseh, were born during the years of plenty and famine (<a href="/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt, once the place of Joseph&#8217;s exile, has become the birthplace of heirs to Israel&#8217;s promise&#8212;a reminder that God&#8217;s purposes advance even in foreign soil (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming their birthplace, Jacob highlights the wideness of God&#8217;s reach: the covenant is not confined to Canaan (compare <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> where God calls Israel out of Egypt).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>before I came to you here</b><p>&#8226; Timing matters.

In the ancient world, adoption transferred full legal status (cf. Moses with Pharaoh&#8217;s daughter, <a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This move doubles Joseph&#8217;s inheritance: each son will receive a tribal allotment (<a href="/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>) while Levi will be set apart for priestly service (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase mirrors God&#8217;s own covenant declaration, &#8220;I will be their God, and they will be My people&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). Jacob models covenant love by bringing outsiders (Egypt-born grandsons) inside the family promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine</b><p>&#8226; Jacob names them in reverse birth order, hinting at the later blessing where Ephraim, the younger, is set before Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Their inclusion anticipates how God often elevates the unexpected: Isaac over Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>), Jacob over Esau (<a href="/romans/9-12.htm">Romans 9:12-13</a>), David over his brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The two boys will become populous tribes, fulfilling <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> that nations and kings would come from Abraham.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Reuben and Simeon are mine</b><p>&#8226; Reuben and Simeon are Jacob&#8217;s first and second sons.

Spiritual privilege is reassigned to faithful obedience rather than mere birth order (<a href="/matthew/21-43.htm">Matthew 21:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The equality Jacob confers foreshadows the church age where inheritance is shared with all who are &#8220;in Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a> records Jacob&#8217;s Spirit-guided adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh.

Through this single verse, we see God&#8217;s promise advancing across geography, generations, and human shortcomings, assuring us that His plans never falter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">As Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</span>--That is, Ephraim shall be regarded as my firstborn, and Manasseh as my second son. This was undoubtedly the case; for though "Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the prince (and of him the Messiah), yet the birthright was Joseph's" (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-2.htm" title="For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)">1Chronicles 5:2</a>). The legal right of the firstborn was a double share of the father's goods. This was bestowed upon Joseph in giving him two tribes, and to the other&#250; sons but one. It was in a spiritual sense, and with reference to the promise that all mankind should be blessed in Jacob's seed, that the birthright was Judah's. As Joseph was the son of the chief and best-beloved wife, he had a sort of claim to the birthright; but in agreement with the law afterwards specially enacted (<a href="/context/deuteronomy/21-15.htm" title="If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>), Jacob acknowledges that the right had belonged to Reuben, but excludes him from the possession of it as the penalty of his great and terrible sin. Simeon and Levi are next passed over, because of their cruelty, and so Judah takes Reuben's place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50-52</a>) <span class="cmt_word">before I came unto thee into Egypt,</span> - this would almost seem to imply that Jacob knew of Joseph's having had sons born to him since his (Jacob's) arrival at Goshen - are mine (i.e. I shall reckon them as my own sons, giving them an equal place with the other members of my family); <span class="cmt_word">as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine</span> - literally, <span class="accented">Ephraim and Manasseh, as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine</span>.
