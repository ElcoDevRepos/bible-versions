In biblical times, marrying at forty was not uncommon, especially for someone of Isaac's status. This age also signifies maturity and readiness for the responsibilities of family life. Isaac's life is often seen as a type of Christ, and his waiting period can be compared to the anticipation of the Messiah.<p><b>when he married Rebekah</b><br>The marriage of Isaac and Rebekah is a pivotal moment in the Abrahamic covenant, ensuring the continuation of God's promise to Abraham. Rebekah's selection as Isaac's wife was divinely orchestrated, as seen in <a href="/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>, where Abraham's servant is led by God to her. This marriage symbolizes God's faithfulness and the importance of divine guidance in choosing a life partner.<p><b>the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean</b><br>Bethuel, Rebekah's father, is identified as an Aramean, indicating the family's origin from the region of Aram. This connection highlights the broader Semitic family ties and the movement of people in the ancient Near East. The Arameans were known for their nomadic lifestyle, which aligns with the patriarchal narratives of movement and settlement.<p><b>from Paddan-aram</b><br>Paddan-aram, also known as Mesopotamia, is a region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. It was a fertile area and a center of early civilization. This geographical detail emphasizes the cultural and economic backdrop of Rebekah's family, providing insight into the wealth and status they might have held. It also underscores the journey Abraham's servant undertook to find a wife for Isaac, reflecting the importance of maintaining familial and cultural ties.<p><b>and the sister of Laban the Aramean</b><br>Laban, Rebekah's brother, plays a significant role in later biblical narratives, particularly in the life of Jacob. His mention here foreshadows future interactions and conflicts within the family. Laban's character is complex, often associated with cunning and manipulation, which becomes evident in his dealings with Jacob. This familial connection also highlights the interconnectedness of the patriarchal families and the unfolding of God's plan through them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a key patriarch in the lineage of the Israelites.
