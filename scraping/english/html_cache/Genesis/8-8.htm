The dove, unlike the raven, is a symbol of peace and purity throughout Scripture. Doves are often associated with the Holy Spirit, as seen in the New Testament during Jesus' baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>). The choice of a dove may reflect Noah's hope for a sign of peace and renewal after the judgment of the flood.<p><b>to see if the waters had receded</b><br>This phrase indicates Noah's desire to assess the condition of the earth post-flood. The receding waters symbolize the end of God's judgment and the beginning of restoration. The flood narrative echoes the creation account, where God separates waters to create dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). Here, Noah is seeking confirmation that the earth is being restored to a habitable state.<p><b>from the surface of the ground</b><br>The focus on the "surface of the ground" highlights the importance of dry land for human habitation and the continuation of life. This phrase connects to the promise of God to never again destroy all living creatures as He did with the flood (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). The ground, once cursed due to Adam's sin (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>), is now being renewed, pointing to God's redemptive plan for creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The central human figure in this account, Noah is a righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.

This proves that the ark had not settled upon a lofty eminence; for as it had been already aground 120 days, and as within another fortnight the waters had "abated from off the earth," it could only have been in some valley or plain among the mountains of Ararat that the waters were thus "on the face of the whole earth," the larger word, yet which certainly does not mean here the whole world, but only a very small region in the immediate neighbourhood of the ark. For, supposing that the raven was sent out one week before the dove, forty-seven days (see <a href="/genesis/8-6.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:">Genesis 8:6</a>) would have elapsed since Noah beheld the glorious panorama of mountain heights all around, and seven days afterwards the dove brought him a freshplucked olive-leaf. Yet, literally, the words are, <span class= "ital">for waters were upon the face of the whole earth. </span>Plainly these large terms in the language of the Bible are to be limited in their interpretation by the general tenor of its narratives.
