In the cultural and historical context of the ancient Near East, it was highly unusual for a woman of Sarah's age to bear children, as she was well past the typical childbearing years. This event underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and Sarah, as seen in <a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16-19</a>, where God promises that Sarah will bear a son. The rhetorical question emphasizes the unexpected and divine nature of the event, pointing to God's power to fulfill His promises against all odds.<p><b>Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.&#8221;</b><br>The birth of Isaac to Abraham and Sarah in their old age is a testament to God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant. Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, as noted in <a href="/genesis/21-5.htm">Genesis 21:5</a>. This miraculous birth prefigures the birth of Jesus Christ, who was also born under extraordinary circumstances, fulfilling God's promise of salvation. The birth of Isaac is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it continues the lineage through which the Messiah would eventually come, as outlined in the genealogies in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. This phrase also reflects the joy and fulfillment of God's promise, as Sarah's barrenness is overcome by divine intervention, symbolizing hope and the power of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarah.htm">Sarah</a></b><br>The wife of Abraham, who miraculously bore a son, Isaac, in her old age.
