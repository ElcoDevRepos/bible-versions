This act of inviting strangers into one's home was a protective gesture, ensuring their safety and well-being. Lot's reference to himself as "your servant" demonstrates humility and a willingness to serve.<p><b>wash your feet and spend the night.</b><br>Foot washing was a common practice in biblical times, symbolizing hospitality and refreshment after travel.

Spending the night implies offering protection and rest, which was vital in a city with a reputation for immorality and danger.<p><b>Then you can rise early and go on your way.&#8221;</b><br>Lot suggests an early departure, possibly indicating his awareness of the city's dangers and his desire to protect the visitors from potential harm.
