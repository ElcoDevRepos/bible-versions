This phrase signifies the foundational structure of the nation of Israel, which plays a central role throughout the Old Testament. Each tribe would later receive a portion of the Promised Land, as detailed in the book of Joshua. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness and divine order, as seen in the twelve apostles in the New Testament.<p><b>and this was what their father said to them</b><br>Jacob, as the patriarch, holds a significant role in delivering these prophetic blessings. His words are not merely paternal advice but are seen as divinely inspired prophecies that would shape the future of each tribe. This moment is reminiscent of other patriarchal blessings, such as Isaac's blessing over Jacob and Esau, which carried significant weight and consequences.<p><b>He blessed them</b><br>The act of blessing is a powerful biblical tradition, often invoking God's favor and protection. In this context, Jacob's blessings are prophetic, foretelling the future of each tribe. The concept of blessing is deeply rooted in the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants, making them a great nation.<p><b>and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing</b><br>Each son receives a blessing tailored to his character and future role within the nation of Israel. This individual attention underscores the personal relationship between God and His people, as well as the unique purpose and destiny assigned to each tribe. The blessings range from promises of prosperity and leadership to warnings of struggle and servitude, reflecting the diverse paths the tribes would take. This personalized approach is echoed in the New Testament, where spiritual gifts are distributed individually by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel, who is giving his final blessings to his sons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_twelve_tribes_of_israel.htm">The Twelve Tribes of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob's twelve sons, each receiving a unique blessing that reflects their future roles and destinies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/blessing_event.htm">Blessing Event</a></b><br>Jacob's prophetic blessings to his sons, which are both a farewell and a foretelling of the future of each tribe.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_individual_roles.htm">The Importance of Individual Roles</a></b><br>Each son received a blessing "appropriate to him," highlighting the unique roles and purposes God has for each person.

Only in case of war they were to combine under the chieftainship of Judah.
