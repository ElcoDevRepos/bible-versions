The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal name of God, indicating a personal relationship with creation. This is a direct communication from God, underscoring the seriousness of the forthcoming judgment.<p><b>I will blot out man</b><br>The term "blot out" suggests a complete removal or erasure, indicating the severity of the judgment. This echoes the concept of divine justice seen throughout Scripture, where sin leads to consequences. It foreshadows the coming flood, which serves as a purifying act to reset creation.<p><b>whom I have created</b><br>This phrase reminds readers of God's role as the Creator, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1-2</a>. It underscores the tragedy of the situation, as God is grieved over the corruption of His creation. It also highlights human accountability to their Creator.<p><b>from the face of the earth</b><br>This indicates the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting all of humanity and the earth itself. It reflects the widespread corruption mentioned earlier in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>. The earth, initially created as a good and perfect habitat, is now subject to divine judgment due to sin.<p><b>every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air</b><br>The inclusion of all living creatures shows the extent of the corruption and the impact of human sin on the entire creation. This mirrors the order of creation in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, suggesting a reversal or undoing of creation due to sin.<p><b>for I am grieved that I have made them</b><br>This phrase reveals God's emotional response to sin, showing that He is not indifferent to the moral state of His creation. The grief of God is a profound theological concept, indicating His deep care and the seriousness of sin.

If the angels were the real authors of the moral corruption of the race, why are they not sentenced as the serpent was in <a href="/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>? <span class="cmt_word">Both man, and beast, and the creeping thing.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">from man unto beast</span>, etc. The lower creatures were involved in the punishment of man neither because of any moral corruption which had entered into them, nor as sharing in the atonement for human sins (Knobel); but rather on the ground of man's sovereignty over the animal world, and its dependence on him (Keil, Lange), and in exemplification of that great principle of Divine government by which the penal consequences of moral evil are allowed to extend beyond the immediate actor (cf. <a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For it repenteth me that I have made them.</span> <span class="accented">Vide supra</span> on ver. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/6-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
