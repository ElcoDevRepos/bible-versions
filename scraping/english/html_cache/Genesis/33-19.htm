The act of pitching a tent suggests a temporary dwelling, yet the purchase of land indicates a more permanent intention. This location is near Shechem, a city in the land of Canaan, which holds future importance for the Israelites. The act of settling here foreshadows the eventual inheritance of the land by Jacob's descendants.<p><b>he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem&#8217;s father</b><br>The purchase of land from the sons of Hamor signifies a legal and peaceful transaction, contrasting with later conflicts in the region. Hamor is the father of Shechem, a city named after his son, which becomes a central location in subsequent biblical narratives. This transaction is reminiscent of Abraham's purchase of the cave of Machpelah (Genesis 23), establishing a pattern of acquiring land through legitimate means. It underscores the importance of establishing a rightful claim to the land, which is a recurring theme in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>for a hundred pieces of silver</b><br>The mention of a specific price highlights the formal nature of the transaction. The "pieces of silver" likely refer to a weight measure, such as shekels, which was a common currency in ancient Near Eastern trade. This detail emphasizes the economic practices of the time and the value placed on land ownership. The purchase price also reflects the significance of the location, as it becomes a part of the heritage of Jacob's family. This act of buying land prefigures the future possession of the Promised Land by the Israelites, symbolizing God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who purchased the land.

Jacob a century later finds it necessary to buy even the ground on which to pitch his tent, though his cattle might still roam freely about for pasture. This, however, would certainly not have been required except in the immediate neighbourhood of a town. As he had now recovered from his sprain, he returns to his habits as a nomad, and dwells in a tent.
