His age at death, 137 years, is consistent with the long lifespans recorded for other figures in Genesis, such as Abraham and Isaac. This longevity underscores the blessing of God upon Abraham's descendants, even those not in the line of the covenant. Ishmael's life span also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Hagar that her son would become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/21-18.htm">Genesis 21:18</a>). Historically, Ishmael is considered the progenitor of the Ishmaelites, a group that played a significant role in the region's history.<p><b>Then he breathed his last and died,</b><br>The phrase "breathed his last" is a common biblical expression for death, emphasizing the cessation of life as a return of the breath or spirit to God (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). Ishmael's death marks the end of his earthly journey and the transition to the afterlife, a concept understood in various ways throughout the Old Testament. His death is recorded without the detailed narratives that accompany the deaths of other patriarchs, reflecting his position outside the primary covenant line through Isaac.<p><b>and was gathered to his people.</b><br>This phrase suggests a reunion with ancestors in the afterlife, a common belief in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It implies a continuation of existence beyond physical death and a connection with one's forebears. In the context of Genesis, being "gathered to his people" indicates a peaceful death and acceptance into the community of the deceased, which for Ishmael would include his father Abraham. This expression is used for several patriarchs, including Abraham (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>) and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>), indicating a shared belief in an afterlife among the early Hebrews.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The first son of Abraham, born to Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant.

A long life of 137 years demonstrates how the Lord fulfilled that word in tangible time and space.<p>&#8226; Ishmael&#8217;s years also remind us of the diminishing longevity after the Flood. Compare Noah&#8217;s 950 years (<a href="/genesis/9-29.htm">Genesis 9:29</a>) to Abraham&#8217;s 175 (<a href="/genesis/25-7.htm">Genesis 25:7</a>) and Isaac&#8217;s 180 (<a href="/genesis/35-28.htm">Genesis 35:28</a>). <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a> notes that an ordinary span of &#8220;seventy, or eighty with strength&#8221; had become typical, so Ishmael&#8217;s 137 still marks a graciously extended life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he breathed his last</b><p>&#8226; The phrase pictures the surrender of life&#8217;s final breath, echoing similar language for other patriarchs&#8212;Abraham &#8220;breathed his last&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>) and Jacob &#8220;drew his feet into the bed, breathed his last&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that breath is a gift from God (<a href="/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>; <a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>). When He withdraws it, life on earth ends (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus, too, &#8220;breathed His last&#8221; on the cross (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), highlighting both the reality of death and the hope of resurrection for all who trust God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And died</b><p>&#8226; Death is stated plainly; Scripture never romanticizes it. <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> traces death&#8217;s entrance to human sin, and <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> affirms that &#8220;it is appointed for man to die once, and after that to face judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ishmael&#8217;s death closes the account of his earthly journey, signalling a transition in Genesis to Isaac&#8217;s line through whom the covenant promises advance (<a href="/genesis/25-19.htm">Genesis 25:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Ishmael&#8217;s recorded death shows God&#8217;s care for every line descended from Abraham, not just the covenant line&#8212;each life is noticed and numbered by the Lord (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And was gathered to his people</b><p>&#8226; The phrase appears for Abraham (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>), Isaac (<a href="/genesis/35-29.htm">Genesis 35:29</a>), Jacob (<a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>), and Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-50.htm">Deuteronomy 32:50</a>). It points beyond the grave to continued conscious existence with those who have gone before.<p>&#8226; Physical burial places differed&#8212;Abraham lay in Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>), Ishmael likely in the wilderness of Paran (<a href="/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>)&#8212;so &#8220;gathered to his people&#8221; cannot refer merely to the tomb. It speaks of reunion in the spiritual realm (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a>; <a href="/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus, Genesis quietly affirms life after death long before later revelations. Believers today rest in the same hope: &#8220;to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-17.htm">Genesis 25:17</a> records Ishmael&#8217;s 137 years, his final breath, his death, and his gathering to his people. Every phrase is historical yet deeply theological: God faithfully extends life according to His promises, numbers every breath, confronts humanity with mortality, and provides hope of reunion beyond the grave. Ishmael&#8217;s brief obituary therefore calls us to trust the God who keeps His word, governs life&#8217;s span, and opens eternity to all who believe.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years</span>: - a life shorter by nearly half a century than that of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/35-21.htm">Genesis 35:21</a>);
