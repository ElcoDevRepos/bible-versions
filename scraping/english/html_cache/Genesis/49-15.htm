The land allotted to Issachar was fertile and productive, located in the Jezreel Valley, which was known for its agricultural richness. This contentment can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual rest and satisfaction found in God's provision. The idea of a "resting place" also connects to the broader biblical theme of rest, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are encouraged to enter God's rest through faith.<p><b>and that his land was pleasant</b><br>The pleasantness of the land indicates not only its physical beauty and fertility but also its strategic importance. The region was a key trade route, which brought prosperity. This aligns with the biblical principle that God provides abundantly for His people. The pleasantness of the land can also be seen as a type of the eternal inheritance promised to believers, as described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>, where the new heaven and new earth are depicted as a place of ultimate beauty and peace.<p><b>so he bent his shoulder to the burden</b><br>This phrase suggests a willingness to work hard and bear burdens. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, agricultural labor was a common and necessary part of life. Issachar's willingness to work reflects a humble acceptance of their role and responsibilities. This can be compared to the call for believers to bear one another's burdens in <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>, demonstrating a life of service and dedication.<p><b>and submitted to labor as a servant</b><br>The submission to labor as a servant highlights the tribe's role in serving others, possibly indicating their involvement in supporting other tribes through their agricultural produce. This servitude can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). It also reflects the Christian call to servanthood, as Jesus taught in <a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>, where He washed the disciples' feet as an example of humble service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/issachar.htm">Issachar</a></b><br>The verse is part of Jacob's blessing to his sons, specifically addressing Issachar.
