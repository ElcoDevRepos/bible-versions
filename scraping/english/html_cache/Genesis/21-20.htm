It reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His promises, as He had assured Hagar that her son would become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/16-10.htm">Genesis 16:10</a>). The divine presence with Ishmael parallels God's presence with other biblical figures, such as Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), indicating that God's plans extend beyond the chosen line of Isaac.<p><b>and he grew up</b><br>Ishmael's growth signifies not only physical maturation but also the fulfillment of God's promise to Hagar. This growth can be seen as a metaphor for the development of nations, as Ishmael is traditionally considered the ancestor of various Arab tribes. The narrative underscores the importance of God's timing and sovereignty in the unfolding of His plans.<p><b>and settled in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness, often a place of testing and transformation in the Bible, becomes Ishmael's home. This setting is significant as it reflects a life of independence and resilience. The wilderness of Paran, where Ishmael settled, is located in the Sinai Peninsula, a region known for its harsh conditions. This environment shaped Ishmael's character and the lifestyle of his descendants, who became known for their nomadic and survival skills.<p><b>and became a great archer</b><br>Ishmael's skill as an archer highlights his ability to thrive in the wilderness, a necessary skill for survival and protection. Archery is often associated with strength and prowess in ancient cultures. This detail connects to the prophecy given to Hagar that Ishmael would be "a wild donkey of a man" (<a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>), living in freedom and independence. The motif of the archer can also be seen in other biblical texts, such as the description of Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>), and serves as a symbol of God's provision and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine presence and protector, ensuring the boy's growth and survival.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boy.htm">The Boy (Ishmael)</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Hagar, who grows up in the wilderness and becomes a skilled archer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>A place of solitude and survival, where Ishmael matures and develops his skills.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/archer.htm">Archer</a></b><br>A skill that Ishmael acquires, symbolizing his ability to provide for himself and his future independence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God keeps His promises, as seen in His care for Ishmael despite the circumstances of his birth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_presence_in_isolation.htm">Divine Presence in Isolation</a></b><br>Even in the wilderness, God is present.
