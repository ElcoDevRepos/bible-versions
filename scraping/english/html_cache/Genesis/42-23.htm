This highlights the dramatic irony in the narrative, as the brothers are oblivious to Joseph's true identity. Joseph, having lived in Egypt for many years, would have been fluent in the Egyptian language, but he was also still proficient in Hebrew, his native tongue. This situation underscores the theme of hidden identity and revelation, which is prevalent throughout Joseph's story. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's hidden plans being revealed in due time, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/esther/6.htm">Esther 6:1-3</a>, where God's providence is unveiled.<p><b>since there was an interpreter between them</b><br>The presence of an interpreter suggests the formal and official nature of the encounter, as Joseph was the governor of Egypt. This detail emphasizes the cultural and linguistic barriers that existed between the Hebrews and Egyptians. It also serves to maintain Joseph's disguise, allowing him to gather information from his brothers without revealing his identity. The use of an interpreter can be seen as a metaphor for the barriers that sin creates between humanity and God, which are ultimately bridged by Christ, the ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The interpreter's role here is crucial in maintaining the suspense and tension of the narrative, as Joseph's brothers are unaware of the true dynamics at play.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

They are standing before the governor of the land yet are blind to the fact that he is their own brother, sold into slavery twenty-two years earlier (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>, <a href="/genesis/42-8.htm">Genesis 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Their lack of recognition mirrors other moments when God allows eyes to be &#8220;kept from recognizing&#8221; until the right time&#8212;such as the two on the Emmaus road with Jesus (<a href="/luke/24-16.htm">Luke 24:16</a>) or Hagar&#8217;s delayed sight of the well (<a href="/genesis/21-19.htm">Genesis 21:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores human limitation: people see only the outward appearance, missing crucial realities (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The brothers think they control the narrative, yet God is guiding every step (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Joseph understood them</b><p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s comprehension is literal&#8212;he speaks the same tongue they do. While they confess in Hebrew, &#8220;Surely we are guilty concerning our brother&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>), Joseph hears every word and is moved to tears (<a href="/genesis/42-24.htm">Genesis 42:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this hints at a greater pattern: the hidden ruler who fully knows the hearts of men (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>; <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; Their candid conversation, spoken in supposed privacy, becomes part of God&#8217;s gracious plan to bring conviction. Just as Nathan&#8217;s words pierced David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), their own words pierce them while Joseph silently listens.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since there was an interpreter between them</b><p>&#8226; Joseph uses an Egyptian interpreter to mask his identity. The brothers assume the governor is a foreigner unfamiliar with their language&#8212;an assumption Joseph cultivates for God-directed purposes (<a href="/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The interpreter reinforces Joseph&#8217;s Egyptian status&#8212;robes, authority, language&#8212;all established since Pharaoh elevated him (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42-44</a>). This allows Joseph to test their hearts without revealing himself, much like Solomon discerned true motives with the two mothers (<a href="/1_kings/3-23.htm">1 Kings 3:23-28</a>).<p>&#8226; God often works behind apparent barriers, turning what seems like distance into opportunity: Moses hidden among Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10-11</a>), Esther concealed in the Persian court (<a href="/esther/2-10.htm">Esther 2:10</a>), Christ veiling His glory in human flesh (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/42-23.htm">Genesis 42:23</a> highlights the irony of the scene: the brothers think they are speaking freely before a foreign ruler, yet the &#8220;unknown&#8221; governor is their brother, fully aware of every word. Their ignorance, Joseph&#8217;s hidden knowledge, and the purposeful use of an interpreter all serve God&#8217;s larger design&#8212;bringing the brothers to repentance, reuniting the family, and preserving the covenant line (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5-8</a>, <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). The verse reminds readers that God hears what we think is hidden, orchestrates events beyond our sight, and graciously uses even our blind moments to move His saving plan forward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they knew not</span> (while they talked in what they imagined to be a foreign dialect to the Egyptian viceroy) <span class="cmt_word">that Joseph understood them;</span> - literally, <span class="accented">heard</span> (so as to understand what was said) <span class="cmt_word">- for he spake unto them by an interpreter</span> - literally, <span class="accented">for the interpreter</span>.
