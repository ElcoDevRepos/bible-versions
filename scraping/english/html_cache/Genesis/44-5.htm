In the context of ancient Egypt, a cup used by a high-ranking official like Joseph would be a valuable and significant item, often made of precious materials. The cup symbolizes Joseph's authority and status. The act of drinking from a cup can also be seen as a sign of fellowship or covenant, as seen in other biblical contexts such as the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>).<p><b>and uses for divination?</b><br>Divination was a common practice in ancient cultures, including Egypt, where it was used to seek guidance from the divine or predict the future. Although Joseph is portrayed as a man of God who interprets dreams through divine revelation (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>), this phrase suggests that the cup was perceived by others as a tool for divination. This could be a strategic move by Joseph to maintain his Egyptian identity and authority while testing his brothers. The Bible generally condemns divination (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), highlighting the tension between Joseph's public persona and his private faith.<p><b>What you have done is wicked!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This accusation of wickedness is directed at Joseph's brothers, who are unaware that the cup was planted in Benjamin's sack as part of Joseph's test. The term "wicked" underscores the severity of the alleged crime, reflecting the moral and legal standards of the time. In the broader narrative, this moment is pivotal in revealing the brothers' character and repentance, as they are forced to confront their past actions against Joseph. This echoes themes of justice and reconciliation found throughout Scripture, such as in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who orchestrates the test of his brothers by placing his silver cup in Benjamin's sack.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, who are returning to Canaan with grain and are unaware of the cup in Benjamin's sack.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest brother, in whose sack the cup is found, creating a crisis for the brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has risen to power and where the events of this chapter unfold.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_silver_cup.htm">The Silver Cup</a></b><br>A symbol of Joseph's authority and a tool used in his test of his brothers' integrity and loyalty.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_and_testing.htm">Integrity and Testing</a></b><br>Joseph's test of his brothers highlights the importance of integrity.

Taking what belongs to a ruler carried severe implications; compare Pharaoh&#8217;s cupbearer&#8217;s responsibility in <a href="/genesis/40-11.htm">Genesis 40:11</a>.<p>&#8226; Scripture often connects a ruler&#8217;s cup with his authority (<a href="/psalms/116-13.htm">Psalm 116:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>), so stealing it symbolically strikes at Joseph&#8217;s standing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and uses for divination?</b><p>&#8226; The steward&#8217;s claim taps into Egyptian beliefs that officials read omens from special vessels.<p>&#8226; Joseph, however, consistently attributes his insight to God alone (<a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>; 41:38), so the &#8220;divination&#8221; charge functions as part of his deliberate test.<p>&#8211; By adopting Egyptian language, Joseph maintains his disguise (<a href="/genesis/42-8.htm">Genesis 42:8</a>).<p>&#8211; He presses the brothers to confront truth, echoing later prohibitions against sorcery (<a href="/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>) but without actually practicing it.<p>&#8226; The mention of divination raises the stakes, making the alleged theft appear not just criminal but sacrilegious in an Egyptian context.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What you have done is wicked!&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; The steward moves from question to verdict, labeling their act &#8220;wicked,&#8221; mirroring the moral weight Joseph wants them to feel (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s forthcoming confession&#8212;&#8220;God has uncovered your servants&#8217; iniquity&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/44-16.htm">Genesis 44:16</a>)&#8212;shows the accusation lodging in their consciences.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;wicked&#8221; anticipates <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>&#8217;s warning against calling evil good and underscores that concealed sin eventually surfaces (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s purpose is restorative: exposing hidden guilt, leading toward repentance, and preparing for reconciliation (<a href="/genesis/45-4.htm">Genesis 45:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The steward&#8217;s statement, crafted by Joseph, uses the stolen cup to press his brothers toward repentance. Emphasizing the cup&#8217;s personal value, invoking alleged divination, and pronouncing their deed &#8220;wicked&#8221; all heighten the moral gravity of the test. Joseph remains faithful to God while skillfully employing Egyptian conventions to awaken his brothers&#8217; consciences and pave the way for forgiveness and family restoration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is this not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cup that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my master</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_113.htm">Strong's 113: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sovereign, controller</span><br /><br /><span class="word">drinks from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;teh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8354.htm">Strong's 8354: </a> </span><span class="str2">To imbibe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and uses for divination?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#7717;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5172.htm">Strong's 5172: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hiss, whisper a, spell, to prognosticate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is wicked!&#8217;&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7791;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7489.htm">Strong's 7489: </a> </span><span class="str2">To spoil, to make, good for, nothing, bad</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/44-5.htm">Genesis 44:5 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/44-5.htm">OT Law: Genesis 44:5 Isn't this that from which my lord (Gen.
