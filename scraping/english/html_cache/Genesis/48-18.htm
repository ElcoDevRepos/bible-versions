This reflects the cultural importance of the firstborn's rights in ancient Near Eastern societies, where the firstborn son traditionally received a double portion of the inheritance and a special blessing. Joseph's objection indicates his understanding of these customs and his desire to see them upheld.<p><b>Joseph said.</b><br>Joseph, a key figure in the Genesis narrative, is speaking here. His life story, from favored son to Egyptian ruler, is a testament to God's providence and faithfulness. Joseph's words carry weight, as he is not only a son but also a powerful leader in Egypt. His intervention in the blessing process shows his active role in his family's spiritual and cultural heritage.<p><b>This one is the firstborn;</b><br>Joseph refers to Manasseh, his elder son, emphasizing the traditional significance of the firstborn. The firstborn's status is a recurring theme in Genesis, seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, and Esau and Jacob. This highlights the tension between human customs and divine choice, as God often subverts human expectations to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>put your right hand on his head.</b><br>The right hand symbolizes power, authority, and blessing throughout the Bible. In the context of blessings, the right hand is often associated with the greater blessing or favor. Joseph's insistence on placing Jacob's right hand on Manasseh's head underscores his desire for the traditional blessing order. However, Jacob's choice to bless Ephraim, the younger, with his right hand reflects God's sovereign will, which often transcends human traditions and expectations. This act foreshadows the biblical theme of the last being first, seen in the lives of David, Solomon, and ultimately Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, Joseph is a key figure in Genesis, known for his rise to power in Egypt and his role in saving his family during a famine.
