Abel's name, meaning "breath" or "vapor," may signify the transient nature of life, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>. The mention of Abel as Cain's brother sets the stage for the first recorded sibling relationship, highlighting themes of family dynamics and rivalry. This relationship foreshadows future biblical narratives of sibling conflict, such as Jacob and Esau or Joseph and his brothers.<p><b>Now Abel was a keeper of sheep,</b><br>Abel's role as a shepherd is significant, as shepherding becomes a prominent occupation among biblical patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This vocation is often associated with righteousness and leadership, as seen in David's early life as a shepherd before becoming king. The shepherd motif is also a type of Christ, who is referred to as the "Good Shepherd" in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, symbolizing care, guidance, and sacrifice.<p><b>while Cain was a tiller of the soil.</b><br>Cain's occupation as a farmer reflects humanity's post-Edenic condition, where working the ground is part of the curse described in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>. Agriculture is a vital aspect of ancient Near Eastern culture, and Cain's role emphasizes the struggle and toil associated with cultivating the land.

Abel&#8217;s very name becomes synonymous with righteousness; Jesus later says, &#8220;from the blood of righteous Abel&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>).<p>&#8226; This verse also begins the Bible&#8217;s first portrait of sibling relationships, setting the stage for both brotherly cooperation and tragic conflict (compare with Joseph and his brothers in <a href="/bsb/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now Abel was a keeper of sheep,</b><p>&#8226;

Abel&#8217;s role foreshadows the sacrificial system: a shepherd brings the firstborn of his flock (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>), hinting at later Passover lamb imagery (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>) and the &#8220;Lamb of God&#8221;

Abel the shepherd models humble dependence and sacrificial faith; Cain the farmer illustrates self-reliance corrupted by sin. Both roles are legitimate vocations, yet their responses to God reveal why one offering is accepted and the other rejected. The verse invites us to value all honest work while recognizing that worship springs from a surrendered heart, pointing ultimately to Christ&#8212;the Good Shepherd and the firstfruits of those raised from the ground.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Abel.</span>--Of this name Dr. Oppert imagined that it was the Assyrian <span class= "ital">Abil, </span>a son. Really it is <span class= "ital">Hebel; </span>and there is no reason why we should prefer an Assyrian to a Hebrew etymology. An Accadian derivation would have been important, but Assyrian is only a Semitic dialect, and <span class= "ital">Abil </span>is the Hebrew <span class= "ital">ben. Hebel </span>means a thing <span class= "ital">unstable, not abiding, </span>like a breath or vapour. Now, we can scarcely suppose that Eve so called her child from a presentiment of evil or a mere passing depression of spirits; more probably it was a title given to him after his untimely death. Giving names to children would become usual only when population increased; and it was not till a religious rite was instituted for their dedication to God that they had names given to them in their infancy. Even then Esau was changed to Edom, and Jacob to Israel, while previously such names as Eber and Peleg, and earlier still Jabal and Jubal, must have been given to those who bore them from what they became. Such names too as Esau, Jacob, and most of those borne by Jacob's children, seem to have been playful titles, given them in the women's tents by quick-witted nurses, who caught up any chance words of the mother, until at length it became the Jewish rule for women to name their children. Probably, therefore, it was only after Abel's death that his sorrowing relatives called him the <span class= "ital">Breath </span>that had passed away.<p><span class= "bld">Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span>--As Adam was 130 years old when Seth was born (<a href="/genesis/5-3.htm" title="And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:">Genesis 5:3</a>), there was a long period for the increase of Adam's family (comp. <a href="/context/genesis/4-14.htm" title="Behold, you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from your face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that finds me shall slay me.">Genesis 4:14-17</a>), and also for the development of the characters of these his two eldest sons. In the one we seem to see a rough, strong nature, who took the hard work as he found it, and subdued the ground with muscular energy; in the other a nature more refined and thoughtful, and making progress upwards. Adam had already tamed animals in Paradise: to these Abel devotes himself, tends them carefully, and gains from them ample and easy means of sustenance, higher in kind even than the fruits of Paradise. Round these two the other sons and daughters of Adam group themselves, and Cain seems already to have had a wife when he murdered his brother (<a href="/genesis/4-17.htm" title="And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.">Genesis 4:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she again bare</span> (literally, <span class="accented">added to bear</span>, a Hebraism adopted in the New Testament; <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/luke/20-11.htm">Luke 20:11</a>) <span class="cmt_word">his brother Abel.</span> <span class="accented">Habel</span> (vanity), supposed to hint either that a mother's eager hopes had already begun to be disappointed in her eider son, or that, having in her first child's name given expression to her faith, in this she desired to preserve a monument of the miseries of human life, of which, perhaps, she had been forcibly reminded by her own maternal sorrows. Perhaps also, though unconsciously, a melancholy prophecy of his premature removal by the hand of fratricidal rage, to which it has been thought there is an outlook by the historian In the frequent (seven times repeated) and almost pathetic mention of the fact that Abel was Cain s brother. The absence of the usual expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, as well as the peculiar phraseology <span class="accented">et addidit parere</span> has suggested that Abel was Cain's twin brother (Calvin, Kimchi, Candlish), though this is not necessarily implied in the text. <span class="cmt_word">And Abel was a keeper of sheep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.; the latter term includes goats - <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm">Leviticus 1:10</a>), <span class="cmt_word">but Cain was a tiller of the ground</span>. These occupations, indirectly suggested by God in the command to till the ground and the gift of the clothes of skin (Keil), were doubtless both practiced by the first man, who would teach them to his sons. It is neither justifiable nor necessary to trace a difference of moral character in the different callings which the young men selected, though probably their choices were determined by their talents and their tastes.
