In ancient Near Eastern culture, marriages were often arranged to form alliances and secure peace between tribes or families. The offer to give daughters in marriage signifies a willingness to establish a covenant relationship, which was a common practice to ensure mutual benefit and protection. This proposal, however, is deceptive, as Jacob's sons have ulterior motives.<p><b>and take your daughters for ourselves.</b><br>The reciprocal nature of this agreement suggests a merging of families and cultures, which was significant in ancient times for expanding influence and resources. However, this also posed a threat to the distinct identity and covenantal purity of Jacob's family, as intermarriage with pagan nations was discouraged (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This reflects the ongoing tension in the biblical narrative between maintaining faithfulness to God's covenant and the temptation to assimilate with surrounding cultures.<p><b>We will dwell among you</b><br>The promise to dwell among the Shechemites indicates a proposed integration into their society. In biblical terms, dwelling often implies a deeper relationship or presence, as seen in God's promise to dwell among His people (<a href="/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>). This phrase foreshadows the potential loss of distinctiveness for Jacob's family, highlighting the importance of remaining separate from pagan influences to fulfill God's promises.<p><b>and become one people.</b><br>Becoming "one people" suggests a complete unification, which would have significant implications for the identity and future of Jacob's descendants. This concept of unity contrasts with God's call for Israel to be a distinct nation set apart for His purposes (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The proposal challenges the covenantal boundaries established by God, emphasizing the need for discernment and faithfulness in maintaining the integrity of God's chosen people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A city in the land of Canaan where the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a> take place.

Yet verse 13 clarifies they spoke &#8220;deceitfully&#8221; to Shechem and Hamor.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently cautions against giving covenant daughters to pagan households (see <a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15&#8211;16</a>). The proposal therefore runs counter to the family&#8217;s previous resolve and signals how far the brothers are willing to go in their ruse.<p>&#8226; The phrase hints at the sacred trust placed on parents to guard their offspring&#8217;s spiritual future (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/7-14.htm">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>). Handing daughters to Canaanites would jeopardize that heritage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and take your daughters for ourselves</b><p>&#8226; The reciprocal clause makes the bargain appear fair: Jacob&#8217;s household would marry into Shechem&#8217;s and vice-versa.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3&#8211;4</a> later forbids exactly this kind of intermarriage because it &#8220;will turn your sons away from following Me.&#8221; By placing this temptation in the brothers&#8217; mouths, Moses underscores the moral tension of the whole chapter.<p>&#8226; The line also exposes the Canaanite mindset&#8212;women are commodities for political alliances, not covenant partners (contrast <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will dwell among you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Dwell&#8221; implies settling down permanently, sharing land, markets, festivals, and gods. Yet God had promised Abraham his own land (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>); merging would dilute that promise.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-35.htm">Psalm 106:35</a> warns that Israel later &#8220;mingled with the nations and learned their works.&#8221; The proposed co-habitation foreshadows that danger.<p>&#8226; For Shechem, the offer meant economic gain (<a href="/genesis/34-23.htm">Genesis 34:23</a>). For the brothers, it was bait setting up their planned response in verse 25.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and become one people</b><p>&#8226; Unity can be a blessing when centered on the Lord (<a href="/ezekiel/37-22.htm">Ezekiel 37:22</a>), but here it would erase the distinct calling of Abraham&#8217;s line (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase exposes the ultimate aim of Hamor and Shechem: full assimilation of Israel into Canaanite society. The brothers appear to agree, but their true intention is judgment, not unity.<p>&#8226; The statement therefore highlights a clash between two identities&#8212;covenant holiness versus cultural convenience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-16.htm">Genesis 34:16</a> records a deceptive offer by Jacob&#8217;s sons: intermarriage, shared residence, and complete social fusion with Shechem&#8217;s clan. On the surface it promises harmony, but within the flow of the chapter it serves as bait, contradicts earlier divine warnings, and spotlights the perennial tension between God&#8217;s call to be set apart and the world&#8217;s pressure to blend in.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then we will give</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1444;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;an&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
