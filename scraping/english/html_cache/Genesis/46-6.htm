The livestock and possessions signify God's blessing and provision, fulfilling His promise to make Abraham's descendants prosperous (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>). The movement of these resources to Egypt foreshadows the eventual enslavement and subsequent exodus, where the Israelites leave Egypt with great wealth (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>). This transfer of wealth also reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the patriarchs, who relied heavily on livestock for sustenance and trade.<p><b>and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt</b><br>This journey to Egypt marks a significant transition in the narrative of the Israelites. It fulfills God's earlier promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The move to Egypt sets the stage for the Israelites' growth into a great nation, as prophesied. Jacob's entire family going to Egypt signifies unity and the continuation of the covenant lineage. This migration also prefigures the later exodus, where Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. The journey to Egypt can be seen as a type of Christ, who also went to Egypt as a child (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>), symbolizing refuge and divine protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob is the central figure in this passage, leading his family to Egypt in obedience to God's direction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where Jacob and his family resided before moving to Egypt.
