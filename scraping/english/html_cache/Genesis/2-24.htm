It points back to the preceding verses where God creates woman from man, establishing the basis for marriage. This principle is timeless and serves as the divine blueprint for marriage.<p><b>a man will leave his father and mother</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, family units were typically extended, with multiple generations living together. The instruction for a man to leave his parents signifies the establishment of a new, independent family unit. This departure is not merely physical but involves a shift in loyalty and priority, emphasizing the importance of the marital relationship over the parental one.<p><b>and be united to his wife</b><br>The Hebrew word for "united" implies a strong, enduring bond. This union is not just a legal or social contract but a deep, personal commitment. The concept of being united reflects the covenant nature of marriage, which is a sacred and binding agreement before God. This unity is echoed in the New Testament, where marriage is likened to the relationship between Christ and the Church (<a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>).<p><b>and they will become one flesh</b><br>This phrase signifies the physical, emotional, and spiritual union of husband and wife. It encompasses the sexual relationship but also extends to a complete sharing of life. The "one flesh" concept is foundational for understanding the exclusivity and permanence of marriage. It is a mystery that reflects the unity and diversity within the Godhead, as well as the unity between Christ and believers. Jesus references this passage in <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm">Matthew 19:5-6</a>, affirming its continued relevance and divine origin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam_and_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a></b><br>The first man and woman created by God, representing the original human couple and the foundation of marriage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/garden_of_eden.htm">Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The setting for the creation of Adam and Eve, symbolizing the ideal environment for human relationships.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The institution established by God as a covenantal union between a man and a woman, as exemplified by Adam and Eve.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_design_of_marriage.htm">The Divine Design of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a divine institution established by God, intended to reflect His covenantal love and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leaving_and_cleaving.htm">Leaving and Cleaving</a></b><br>The call to "leave" one's parents signifies the establishment of a new, primary family unit, while "cleaving" emphasizes the commitment and unity required in marriage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_oneness.htm">Unity and Oneness</a></b><br>The concept of becoming "one flesh" highlights the deep, intimate bond that marriage creates, encompassing physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_reflection_of_christ_and_the_church.htm">Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church</a></b><br>Just as Christ is united with the Church, marriage serves as a living illustration of this sacred relationship, calling spouses to love and serve one another selflessly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">Guarding the Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>In a world that often devalues marriage, believers are called to uphold its sanctity, recognizing it as a holy covenant before God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_2_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 2:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_24_s_view_on_marriage.htm">How does Genesis 2:24 define the foundation of a biblical marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_leave_parents_mean_in_marriage.htm">What does "leave his father and mother" imply about marital priorities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_marriage_mirror_Christ_Church.htm">How does "be united to his wife" reflect Christ's relationship with the Church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_couples_unite_daily.htm">In what ways can couples practically "become one flesh" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_24_s_role_in_marriage_today.htm">How can understanding Genesis 2:24 strengthen commitment in Christian marriages today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_24_s_biblical_view_on_marriage.htm">How does Genesis 2:24 define the concept of marriage in a biblical context?

Adam names this new product of creative power, as he had named others, but he knew nothing about young men leaving their father's house for the wife's sake. Moreover, in <a href="/matthew/19-5.htm" title="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?">Matthew 19:5</a>, our Lord quotes these words as spoken by God, and the simplest interpretation of this declaration is that the inspired narrator was moved by the Spirit of God to give this solemn sanction to marriage, founded upon Adam's words. The great and primary object of this part of the narrative is to set forth marriage as a Divine ordinance. The narrator describes Adam's want, pictures him as examining all animal life, and studying the habits of all creatures so carefully as to be able to give them names, but as returning from his search unsatisfied. At last one is solemnly brought to him who is his counterpart, and he calls her <span class= "ital">Ishah, </span>his feminine self, and pronounces her to be his very bone and flesh.
