This reflects the cultural practice of arranged marriages and the importance of fulfilling contractual agreements. Jacob's service to Laban is reminiscent of the servitude of the Israelites in Egypt, highlighting themes of labor and reward. The narrative also foreshadows the future struggles between Jacob's descendants and Laban's kin.<p><b>Grant me my wife</b><br>Jacob's request is direct, emphasizing the fulfillment of the marriage contract. In ancient Near Eastern culture, marriage agreements were binding, and Jacob's insistence underscores the importance of covenant faithfulness. This mirrors God's covenant with His people, where promises are expected to be honored.<p><b>for my time is complete</b><br>Jacob's statement indicates the completion of the agreed-upon seven years of service. This period symbolizes a time of testing and preparation, akin to the Israelites' 40 years in the wilderness. The number seven often represents completeness and divine perfection in Scripture, suggesting that Jacob's service was divinely ordained.<p><b>and I want to sleep with her</b><br>This phrase reflects the consummation of marriage, which was a significant cultural and legal act in biblical times. It underscores the legitimacy of Jacob's claim to Rachel as his wife. The desire for union can be seen as a type of Christ's desire for the Church, His bride, highlighting themes of love, commitment, and covenant fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob is a central patriarch in the biblical account.

By addressing Laban directly, Jacob acknowledges the father&#8217;s role in giving his daughter in marriage (compare <a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50&#8211;51</a>).<p>&#8226; His initiative mirrors the biblical pattern of a man seeking a wife under proper authority (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Grant me my wife</b><p>&#8226;

After seven faithful years of service, he respectfully appeals to Laban to complete the marriage covenant, honoring both family authority and God&#8217;s design for marital intimacy.
