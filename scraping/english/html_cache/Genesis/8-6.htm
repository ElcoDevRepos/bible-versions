In this context, the forty days follow the cessation of the rain, marking a time of waiting and preparation for the next phase of God's plan for Noah and his family.<p><b>Noah opened the window</b><br>The act of opening the window signifies a transition from confinement to exploration and renewal. The window, likely a small opening for ventilation and light, becomes a means for Noah to assess the world outside. This action reflects a step of faith and obedience, as Noah seeks to understand God's timing for leaving the ark. The window also symbolizes hope and the anticipation of a new beginning after the judgment of the flood.<p><b>he had made in the ark</b><br>The phrase emphasizes Noah's role in the construction of the ark, highlighting his obedience to God's instructions (<a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14-16</a>). The ark itself is a type of Christ, providing salvation and refuge from judgment. Just as Noah followed God's detailed plans for the ark, believers are called to follow Christ, who is the ultimate provision for salvation. The ark's construction and Noah's actions demonstrate the importance of faith and obedience in the face of divine judgment and deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve life on earth.

God&#8217;s timetable is exact; every day counted.<p>- Forty in Scripture often signals testing and transition: the rain itself fell forty days (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Moses fasted forty days on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), Elijah journeyed forty days to Horeb (<a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>), and Jesus was tempted forty days in the wilderness (<a href="/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>). Each instance moves God&#8217;s plan forward after a divinely set wait.<p>- For Noah, this span allowed the floodwaters to continue receding (<a href="/genesis/8-5.htm">Genesis 8:5</a>). The verse quietly underlines faith-filled patience: he waited until God&#8217;s timing indicated the next step, mirroring <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, &#8220;Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous, wait patiently for the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Noah opened the window</b><p>- Action follows waiting. <a href="/genesis/6-16.htm">Genesis 6:16</a> shows God had instructed Noah to build this window; now Noah actively uses what obedience had already prepared.<p>- Opening the window is a deliberate act of faith. Though the waters were still present (<a href="/genesis/8-5.htm">Genesis 8:5</a>), Noah sought fresh evidence of God&#8217;s deliverance. Like the lepers who moved toward the priests &#8220;as they went&#8221; and were cleansed (<a href="/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>), obedience preceded visible change.<p>- This step illustrates partnership with God: the same hands that built under command now open in expectation (<a href="/james/2-22.htm">James 2:22</a>, faith working with works). Noah&#8217;s reliance stays rooted in God&#8217;s word, yet he does what he can, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he had made in the ark</b><p>- The phrase recalls Noah&#8217;s meticulous obedience to every specification God gave (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>). The window existed only because Noah trusted God enough to build exactly as told (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>).<p>- Practical provision: the ark was fully sealed (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>), yet God ensured ventilation and visibility through this window. His commands never lack foresight; likewise, Noah&#8217;s obedience earlier now becomes a means of blessing. Compare <a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>, where Moses is told to build the tabernacle &#8220;exactly according to the pattern.&#8221;<p>- The location &#8220;in the ark&#8221; reminds us salvation is found inside God&#8217;s provision. Just as the ark preserved Noah&#8217;s family (<a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>), Christ now shelters believers (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>). The window offered perspective while keeping Noah safely within God&#8217;s appointed refuge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6</a> records a simple, literal moment loaded with meaning: after God-determined waiting, Noah exercises obedient faith by opening the very window he had earlier built at God&#8217;s command. The verse highlights patient trust, active partnership with the Lord, and the wisdom of precise obedience. Waiting in God&#8217;s timing, walking by faith, and working according to His instructions remain inseparable realities for every believer today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Noah opened the window.</span>--Not the <span class= "ital">zohar </span>of <a href="/genesis/6-16.htm" title="A window shall you make to the ark, and in a cubit shall you finish it above; and the door of the ark shall you set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shall you make it.">Genesis 6:16</a>, but an aperture. He had waited forty days after seeing the heights around him rising clearly into the air, and then, impatient of the slow subsidence of the waters, Noah at last sent forth a raven to bring him some news of the state of the earth. This bird was chosen as one strong of flight, and also, perhaps, because anciently regarded as prophetic of the weather; besides this, it is easily tamed, and as Noah retained its mate he had security for its return. And so it seems to have done, for it is described as going "forth to and fro." Each night it returned to the ark, and probably to its old perch near the female. The <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>agrees with many commentators and the ancient versions in supposing that the raven did not return, finding abundant food in the floating dead bodies (<span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>p. 286); but this is contrary to the Hebrew. The versions must have had a negative in their copies, and have read, "which went forth, going, and not returning." The present Hebrew text is, however, consistent with itself; for it adds, "until the waters," &c. This must mean that as soon as the earth was dry this going to and fro ceased.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span>, literally, <span class="accented">it</span> was - <span class="cmt_word">at the end of forty days.</span> Delaying through combined fear and sorrow on account of the Divine judgment (Calvin); to allow sufficient space to undo the effect of the forty days' rain (Murphy); probably just to be assured that the Deluge would not return. <span class="cmt_word">That Noah opened the window</span> - <span class="accented">chalon</span>, a window, "so called from being perforated, from <span class="accented">chalal</span>, to bore or pierce" (Gesenius); used of the window of Rahab's house (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>); not the window (<span class="accented">tsohar</span>) of <a href="/genesis/6-16.htm">Genesis 6:16</a>, q.v. - <span class="cmt_word">of the ark which ha had made</span>: <span class="cmt_word">and he sent forth a raven.</span> Literally, the <span class="accented">orev</span>, so called from its black color' (Gesenius; cf. <a href="/songs/5-11.htm">Song of Solomon 5:11</a>), Latin, <span class="accented">corvus</span>, a raven or crow; the article being used either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the species of bird is intended to be indicated (Kalisch), or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because there was only one male raven in the ark, the raven being among the unclean birds (<a href="/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>; Lunge); but against this is "the dove" (per. 8); or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because it had come to be well known from this particular circumstance (Keil). Its peculiar fitness for the mission imposed on it lay in its being a bird of prey, and therefore able to sustain itself by feeding on carrion (<a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>). To the incident here recorded is doubtless to be traced the prophetic character which in the ancient heathen world, and among the Arabians in particular, was supposed to attach to this ominous bird. <span class="cmt_word">Which went to and fro.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">and it went forth going and returning, i.e.</span> flying backwards and forwards, from the ark and to the ark, perhaps resting on it, but not entering into it (Calvin, Willet, Ainsworth, Keil, Kalisch, Lunge, Bush, 'Speaker's Commentary'); though some have conceived that it no more returned to the ark, but kept flying to and fro throughout the earth (LXX., "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>;" Vulgate, "qui egrediebatur et non revertebatur;" Alford, "it is hardly probable that it returned;" Murphy, "it did not need to return"). <span class="cmt_word">Until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</span> When of course its return was unnecessary. Cf. for a similar form of expression <a href="/2_samuel/6-23.htm">2 Samuel 6:23</a>. Whether it entirely disappeared at the first, or continued hovering round the ark, Noah was unable from its movements to arrive at any certain conclusion as to the condition of the earth, and accordingly required to adopt another expedient, which he did in the mission of the dove. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/8-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7093.htm">Strong's 7093: </a> </span><span class="str2">An extremity, after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">forty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Noah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1428;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5146.htm">Strong's 5146: </a> </span><span class="str2">Noah -- 'rest', patriarch who survived the flood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;ta&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6605.htm">Strong's 6605: </a> </span><span class="str2">To open wide, to loosen, begin, plough, carve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the window</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2474.htm">Strong's 2474: </a> </span><span class="str2">A window</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the ark</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;t&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8392.htm">Strong's 8392: </a> </span><span class="str2">A box, chest</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/8-6.htm">Genesis 8:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/8-6.htm">OT Law: Genesis 8:6 It happened at the end of forty (Gen.
