In the ancient Near Eastern context, such familial relationships were complex, and half-sibling marriages were not uncommon (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>). Abram's fear of being killed for Sarai's beauty led him to this half-truth, reflecting a lack of trust in God's protection. This incident foreshadows similar events in <a href="/genesis/20.htm">Genesis 20</a> with Abimelech and later with Isaac and Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/26.htm">Genesis 26</a>, indicating a recurring theme of fear and deception among the patriarchs.<p><b>so that I took her as my wife?</b><br>Pharaoh's taking of Sarai into his house reflects the customs of royal harems in ancient Egypt, where kings often took multiple wives. This action, however, was based on a misunderstanding, as Pharaoh was unaware of Sarai's true marital status. The situation underscores the potential consequences of Abram's deception and the cultural practices of the time, where women could be taken into a ruler's household without their consent. This event also sets the stage for God's intervention to protect the covenant lineage.<p><b>Now then, here is your wife.</b><br>Pharaoh's return of Sarai to Abram demonstrates a recognition of divine intervention, as God inflicted plagues on Pharaoh's household (<a href="/genesis/12-17.htm">Genesis 12:17</a>). This acknowledgment of God's power by a pagan ruler highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His chosen people. It also serves as a precursor to the later plagues in Egypt during the Exodus, where God's power is again demonstrated to a Pharaoh.<p><b>Take her and go!&#8221;</b><br>Pharaoh's command for Abram to leave with Sarai reflects a desire to avoid further divine retribution. This expulsion from Egypt parallels the later Exodus, where the Israelites are also sent away after experiencing God's deliverance. The phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's will and the consequences of straying from His path. It also foreshadows the journey of faith that Abram and his descendants will undertake, relying on God's guidance and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

During the interval before the marriage Pharaoh and his household were visited with such marked troubles that he became alarmed, and possibly Sarai then revealed to him her true relationship to Abram. We find in <a href="/esther/2-12.htm" title="Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)">Esther 2:12</a> that in the case of maidens there was a probation of twelve months duration before the marriage took place, and Sarai was probably saved by some such formality. The conduct of Pharaoh is upright and dignified; nor ought we to disbelieve his assurance that he had acted upon the supposition that Sarai might lawfully be his. The silence of Abram seems to indicate his consciousness that Pharaoh had acted more righteously than himself, and yet his repetition of the offence (Genesis 20) shows that he did not feel much self-reproach at what he had done; nor, possibly, ought we to judge his conduct from the high standpoint of Christian morality. When, however, commentators speak of it as Abram's fall, they forget that he arranged this matter with Sarai at the very time when he was quitting Haran (<a href="/genesis/20-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.">Genesis 20:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/12-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did you say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;She is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my sister,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1465;&#1443;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_269.htm">Strong's 269: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sister -- a sister</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so that I took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;eq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3947.htm">Strong's 3947: </a> </span><span class="str2">To take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her as my wife?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Now then,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">here</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
