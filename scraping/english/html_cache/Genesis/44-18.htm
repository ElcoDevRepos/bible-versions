Judah, who once suggested selling Joseph into slavery, now steps forward as a leader and advocate for his family. This act of courage and responsibility marks a transformation in Judah's character. The setting is Egypt, where Joseph, now a powerful official, holds authority over the land. Judah's approach is a fulfillment of the earlier prophecy that the scepter will not depart from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), foreshadowing the leadership role his tribe will play in Israel's history.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord.</b><br>Judah's respectful address to Joseph as "Sir" and "my lord" reflects the cultural norms of the time, where hierarchy and respect for authority were paramount. The use of "your servant" indicates humility and submission, essential for the plea he is about to make. This interaction is a model of diplomacy and tact, as Judah seeks to appeal to Joseph's sense of justice and mercy.<p><b>Do not be angry with your servant,</b><br>Judah's request for Joseph not to be angry underscores the tension and high stakes of the situation. The brothers are unaware that they are speaking to Joseph, whom they wronged years earlier. This plea for patience and understanding is crucial, as Judah is about to reveal sensitive family matters. It also reflects the biblical theme of seeking reconciliation and forgiveness, which is central to the story of Joseph and his brothers.<p><b>for you are equal to Pharaoh himself.</b><br>Judah acknowledges Joseph's authority, equating him with Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt. This statement highlights Joseph's rise to power and the fulfillment of his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where he envisioned his family bowing to him. It also emphasizes the gravity of the situation, as Judah recognizes that Joseph holds the power of life and death over them. This acknowledgment sets the stage for Joseph's eventual revelation of his identity and the reconciliation that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah steps forward as a spokesperson for his brothers, demonstrating leadership and responsibility.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers to see if they have changed since they sold him into slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whom Joseph serves.

And thy servant my father said unto us</span> (at this point Judah with increased tenderness alludes to the touching lamentation of the stricken patriarch as he first listens to the unwelcome proposition to take Benjamin from his side), <span class="cmt_word">Ye know that my wife</span> - Rachel was all through her life the wife of his affections (cf. <a href="/genesis/46-19.htm">Genesis 46:19</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">bare me two sons:</span> - Joseph and Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22, 24</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and the one</span> (Joseph) <span class="cmt_word">went out from me</span> (and returned not, thus indirectly alluding to his death), <span class="cmt_word">and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since.</span> Jacob means that had Joseph been alive, he would certainly have returned; but that as since that fatal day of his departure from Hebron he had never beheld him, he could only conclude that his inference was correct, and that Joseph was devoured by some beast of prey. <span class="cmt_word">And if ye take this also from me</span> (in the sense which the next clause explains), <span class="cmt_word">and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave</span> <span class="accented">- Sheol</span> (vide <a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and now</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>when I come</span> (or go) <span class="cmt_word">to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life</span> (or soul) <span class="cmt_word">is bound up in the lad's life</span> (or soul); <span class="cmt_word">it shall come to pass, when he sooth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever</span> (vide <a href="/genesis/43-9.htm">Genesis 43:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore</span> (literally, and now), <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman</span> (or servant) <span class="cmt_word">to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</span> "There was no duty that imperiously prohibited Judah from taking the place of his unfortunate brother. His children, and even his wife, if he had been in the married state, might have been sent to Egypt. He was so far master of his own liberty that he could warrantably put himself in Benjamin's room, if the governor gave his consent" (Lawson). <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on</span> (literally, <span class="accented">shall find</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>my father</span>. The sublime heroism of this noble act of self-sacrifice on the part of Judah it is impossible to over-estimate. In behalf of one whom he knew was preferred to a higher place in his father's affection than himself, he was willing to renounce his liberty rather than see his aged parent die of a broken heart. The self-forgetful magnanimity of such an action has never been eclipsed, and seldom rivaled. After words so exquisitely beautiful and profoundly pathetic it was impossible for Joseph to doubt that a complete change had passed upon his brethren, and in particular upon Judah, since the day when he had eloquently urged, and they had wickedly consented, to sell their brother Joseph into Egypt. Everything was now ready for the denouement in this domestic drama. The story of Joseph's discovery of himself to his astonished brethren is related in the ensuing chapter. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">approached</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
