This longevity is often attributed to the pristine conditions of the early earth and the effects of the Fall not yet fully manifesting in human genetics. The ages also serve to bridge the genealogical gap between Adam and Noah, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan through specific lineages. Seth, as the appointed son after Abel's death, represents the godly line through which the promise of redemption would continue.<p><b>he became the father of Enosh</b><br>The birth of Enosh marks a significant point in biblical history. Enosh's name is often associated with the concept of frailty or mortality, highlighting humanity's dependence on God. This period is noted in <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a>, where it is said that "people began to call on the name of the LORD," indicating a revival or formalization of worship practices. Enosh's lineage is crucial as it leads to Noah and eventually to Abraham, through whom God's covenant promises are further revealed. This genealogy underscores the theme of God's faithfulness in preserving a remnant through whom the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually come, fulfilling the promise of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seth.htm">Seth</a></b><br>The third son of Adam and Eve, born after the death of Abel.

Just as &#8220;Adam lived 130 years and had a son in his own likeness&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3</a>), so Seth&#8217;s lifespan is traced with equal care.<p>- These specific ages help us track the unfolding of God&#8217;s plan after the Fall. They bridge Adam (<a href="/genesis/5-1.htm">Genesis 5:1-5</a>) to Noah (<a href="/genesis/5-28.htm">Genesis 5:28-32</a>) and show that real people, not myths, carried the promise forward (cf. <a href="/luke/3-38.htm">Luke 3:38</a>).<p>- A century-plus lifespan reminds us of God&#8217;s patience and the slower pace of life before the Flood.
