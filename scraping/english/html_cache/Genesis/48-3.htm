Jacob, also known as Israel, is nearing the end of his life and is imparting a blessing and important family history to Joseph. This interaction underscores the patriarchal tradition of passing down blessings and covenantal promises to the next generation, a key theme in Genesis.<p><b>God Almighty appeared to me</b><br>The term "God Almighty" is translated from the Hebrew "El Shaddai," emphasizing God's power and sufficiency. This divine title is used throughout Genesis to denote God's covenantal relationship with the patriarchs. The appearance of God to Jacob signifies a theophany, a direct encounter with the divine, which is a pivotal moment in Jacob's life, reinforcing God's promises to him and his descendants.<p><b>at Luz in the land of Canaan</b><br>Luz is the ancient name for Bethel, a significant location in Jacob's life. It is where Jacob had his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>) and where God reaffirmed the Abrahamic covenant with him. The land of Canaan is the Promised Land, central to the narrative of the Israelites and God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and there He blessed me</b><br>The blessing Jacob received at Bethel included the promise of land, descendants, and a special relationship with God. This blessing is part of the Abrahamic covenant, which is foundational to the narrative of the Israelites. It also foreshadows the blessings that Jacob will pass on to his sons, particularly Joseph, and through him, to Ephraim and Manasseh. This blessing is a precursor to the ultimate blessing fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the seed through whom all nations will be blessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, originally named Jacob, who was later renamed Israel by God.

By invoking this name, Jacob reminds Joseph that:<p>&#8226; The same God who empowered Abraham to father Isaac and Isaac to father Jacob is still acting.<p>&#8226; Every promise about offspring, protection, and land rests on God&#8217;s sufficiency, not on Jacob&#8217;s fading strength (<a href="/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The blessing about to be transferred is anchored in God&#8217;s unchanging character (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan</b><p>Jacob recalls the literal, physical appearance of God at Luz&#8212;later renamed Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>; 35:6-7). That encounter included:<p>&#8226; A vivid revelation of a stairway reaching to heaven, assuring Jacob of ongoing angelic ministry and divine presence (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>).<p>&#8226; A reaffirmation of the land promise while Jacob was still a wanderer (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>).<p>&#8226; A life-changing moment that turned a frightened fugitive into a worshiper who vowed loyalty to God (<a href="/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20-22</a>).<p>Mentioning &#8220;in the land of Canaan&#8221; emphasizes that the same soil on which God appeared will be the lasting inheritance of Jacob&#8217;s descendants (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And there He blessed me</b><p>The blessing at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>; 35:9-15) contained three core elements:<p>1.

By recalling the Almighty&#8217;s appearance and blessing, Jacob demonstrates that the inheritance of land, lineage, and divine favor flows directly from God&#8217;s own promise, ensuring that what began with Abraham continues unbroken through Joseph&#8217;s line and, ultimately, through all who trust the God of the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">God Almighty.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">El Shaddai. </span>The act recorded in this chapter is grounded by Jacob upon the promise made to him at Bethel on his return from Padan-aram; and it was under the old covenant name by which God had revealed Himself to Abram (<a href="/genesis/17-1.htm" title="And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be you perfect.">Genesis 17:1</a>) that he was there made the heir of the Abrahamic promises.
