It underscores the importance of Sarah in the narrative and the respect given to her by a foreign king. This interaction follows a divine warning to Abimelech in a dream, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the need for restitution.<p><b>&#8220;See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver.</b><br>Abimelech refers to Abraham as Sarah's "brother," reflecting the earlier deception where Abraham and Sarah claimed to be siblings. The "thousand pieces of silver" is a significant sum, indicating the king's desire to make amends and restore honor. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such a gift would serve as a public declaration of innocence and a means to restore social standing.<p><b>It is your vindication before all who are with you;</b><br>The term "vindication" suggests a legal or formal clearing of any wrongdoing. This public act serves to protect Sarah's reputation among her household and the wider community. It also reflects the biblical principle of restitution and the importance of maintaining one's honor and integrity.<p><b>you are completely cleared.&#8221;</b><br>This final assurance from Abimelech confirms that Sarah is exonerated from any suspicion of wrongdoing. It highlights the theme of divine protection and intervention, as God had previously warned Abimelech in a dream.

A thousand shekels would be about 125, a large sum at a time when silver was scarce and dear.<p><span class= "bld">He is to thee a covering of the eyes.</span>--This speech of Abimelech is full of difficulty. It begins with a touch of irony in calling Abraham "thy brother." Next, if the pronoun is translated in the masculine, <span class= "ital">he, </span>the meaning would be that Abraham ought to have been Sarah's protector, but had failed in this duty; but, more probably, it is neuter, and refers to the gift. The "covering of the eyes" may mean a veil to protect her from the wanton desires of others, or to conceal her shame at the wrong done to her. Finally, the verb rendered "reproved" is equivocal, and should rather be translated <span class= "ital">righted. </span>It may also be the third person singular feminine, as in our version, or the second person, in which case it is part of Abimelech's speech. The clause "and with all" must then be taken with this verb, and the whole be rendered, <span class= "ital">and in everything thou art even righted. </span>The correct rendering probably is, "And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother (a gift worth) a thousand (pieces) of silver: behold, it shall be to thee for a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee (that is,--so large a compensation for the wrong done thee in taking thee from thy husband, will be a proof to all thy friends and attendants that thou hast not been disgraced, but treated with honour); and in respect of all that has happened thou art thus righted."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy Brother a thousand pieces of silver.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">a thousand of silver</span>, the exact weight of each piece being uncertain.
