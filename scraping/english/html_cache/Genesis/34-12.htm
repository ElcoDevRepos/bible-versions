This practice was not only a financial transaction but also a way to formalize the marriage agreement and demonstrate the groom's ability to provide for the bride. The mention of a "high dowry and an expensive gift" indicates the seriousness of the proposal and the desire to compensate for the wrongdoing committed by Shechem. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where marriages often involved negotiations and financial arrangements. The concept of a dowry is seen in other biblical accounts, such as the marriage of Isaac and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>) and Jacob's service for Rachel and Leah (<a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18-20</a>).<p><b>and I will give you whatever you ask</b><br>This phrase underscores the desperation and willingness of Shechem and his father Hamor to secure Dinah as Shechem's wife. It highlights the extent to which they are prepared to go to make amends and legitimize the union. This offer of open-ended negotiation is significant, as it shows the weight of the offense and the cultural importance of restoring honor through marriage. The willingness to meet any demand parallels other biblical instances where individuals offer significant sacrifices or commitments to achieve reconciliation or favor, such as King Saul's offer to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>).<p><b>Only give me the girl as my wife!</b><br>Shechem's insistence on marrying Dinah despite the circumstances reveals the depth of his desire and possibly his infatuation with her. This plea is central to the narrative, as it sets the stage for the subsequent actions of Dinah's brothers. The request for marriage, despite the violation, reflects the cultural expectation that marriage could rectify such situations. However, it also highlights the tension between cultural practices and moral justice. The demand for Dinah as a wife can be contrasted with other biblical narratives where marriage is sought under different circumstances, such as Boaz's honorable intentions towards Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The son of Hamor the Hivite, who defiled Dinah, Jacob's daughter.

In the ancient Near-Eastern world a dowry, or bride-price, was meant to honor the bride and protect her future (<a href="/genesis/24-53.htm">Genesis 24:53</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16-17</a>). Here Shechem&#8217;s father Hamor invites Jacob&#8217;s family to name a price &#8220;as high as you like.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The invitation sounds generous, yet it is an attempt to smooth over a serious sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking Jacob&#8217;s family to set the amount, Hamor hopes to show goodwill&#8212;while shifting any appearance of blame from his son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and an expensive gift</b><p>The &#8220;dowry&#8221; covers the bride-price, but the &#8220;gift&#8221; refers to additional presents offered directly to the bride&#8217;s family to secure favor (<a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>). Hamor proposes both, signaling that no expense is too great.<p>&#8226; Such lavishness is not driven by genuine repentance but by a desire to legitimize Shechem&#8217;s actions without consequence (<a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between material wealth and moral failure is striking; no payment can erase the wrong done to Dinah (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will give you whatever you ask</b><p>This open-ended promise echoes royal offers like Ahasuerus to Esther (<a href="/esther/5-3.htm">Esther 5:3</a>) and Herod to Herodias&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/6-22.htm">Mark 6:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Hamor seeks to buy peace at any cost, prioritizing political alliance over righteousness (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s sons see the hypocrisy; their later response will expose that they never intended to bargain away their sister&#8217;s dignity (<a href="/genesis/34-13.htm">Genesis 34:13-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only give me the girl as my wife!</b><p>Shechem&#8217;s plea reveals his driving motive: securing Dinah for himself. The phrase underscores self-interest rather than genuine love or repentance (<a href="/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>).<p>&#8226; He wants resolution on his terms, ignoring God&#8217;s covenant boundaries for Israel&#8217;s family (<a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The urgency hints at fear of retaliation and an attempt to legitimize wrongdoing after the fact (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a> shows Hamor and Shechem trying to substitute money and gifts for true repentance and justice. They offer unlimited wealth&#8212;yet their proposal cannot undo the violation of Dinah or reconcile them to God&#8217;s standards. The passage warns that sin cannot be bought off; genuine change requires confession, restitution, and alignment with God&#8217;s righteous ways.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Dowry and gift.</span>--The word rendered <span class= "ital">dowry </span>(mohar) is the price paid to the parents and relatives of the bride, though taking the form of a present.
