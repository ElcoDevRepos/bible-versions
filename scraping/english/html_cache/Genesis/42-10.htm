The term "my lord" reflects the respect and submission they show to Joseph, who is the governor of Egypt, though they do not recognize him as their brother. This interaction highlights the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) where his brothers would bow to him. The use of "my lord" is significant in the cultural context of ancient Egypt, where titles and respect for authority were paramount. This phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Joseph's position allows him to test his brothers' character and repentance.<p><b>"Your servants have come to buy food."</b><br>This statement underscores the dire situation in Canaan due to the widespread famine, which had driven Joseph's brothers to Egypt. The term "servants" indicates their humility and desperation, acknowledging their dependence on the Egyptian authority for survival. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it brings the brothers into direct contact with Joseph, whom they sold into slavery years earlier. The famine, a recurring theme in biblical history, often serves as a catalyst for God's people to move and fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>) and later, the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and preservation of Jacob's family, which is crucial for the continuation of the Abrahamic covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who traveled to Egypt to buy grain during a severe famine.
