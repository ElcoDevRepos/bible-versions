This reference to Beor is distinct from Balaam son of Beor, found in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>, though the name similarity is notable. The name Bela means "destruction" or "devouring," which may reflect his reign or character. The Edomites, descendants of Esau, often had contentious relations with Israel, highlighting the ongoing struggle between the descendants of Jacob and Esau.<p><b>reigned in Edom</b><br>Edom, located in the region of modern-day Jordan, was a significant kingdom during the time of the patriarchs. The Edomites were known for their wisdom and strategic location along trade routes. The reign of kings in Edom before Israel had kings (as noted in <a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>) suggests a structured society. This pre-Israelite monarchy indicates the development of political systems in the ancient Near East. The Edomites' relationship with Israel is complex, often marked by conflict, as seen in passages like Obadiah and <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>.<p><b>the name of his city was Dinhabah</b><br>Dinhabah, though not extensively detailed in biblical or archaeological records, is identified as Bela's capital. The naming of cities after rulers or significant figures was common in ancient times, reflecting the ruler's influence or legacy. The location of Dinhabah is uncertain, but it is part of the broader Edomite territory. The mention of specific cities in genealogies and king lists underscores the historical and geographical context of the narrative, providing a glimpse into the urban centers of the time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bela.htm">Bela</a></b><br>The first king of Edom, mentioned in this verse.
