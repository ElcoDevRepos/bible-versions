In the biblical narrative, Noah is seen as a second Adam, and his sons are the progenitors of the new human race. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in Scripture, suggesting the completeness of God's plan for humanity's renewal. The genealogies in <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, known as the Table of Nations, trace the descendants of these three sons, emphasizing their role in repopulating the earth.<p><b>and from them the whole earth was populated</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief that all nations and peoples are descended from Noah's sons, highlighting the unity and common ancestry of humanity. This idea is foundational for understanding the biblical perspective on race and ethnicity, suggesting that all humans are part of one family. The dispersion of Noah's descendants is further detailed in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a> with the Tower of Babel, where God confuses their language and scatters them across the earth. This scattering fulfills God's command to "fill the earth" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). Theologically, this phrase also points to the eventual gathering of all nations in Christ, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a> and the vision of a diverse multitude in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.
