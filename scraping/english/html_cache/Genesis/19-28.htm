These cities were known for their wickedness and sin, particularly the sin of sexual immorality and pride, as noted in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49-50</a>. The destruction of these cities serves as a warning of divine judgment against sin. The geographical location of Sodom and Gomorrah is traditionally associated with the area near the Dead Sea, although their exact locations remain uncertain. This act of looking down signifies Abraham's concern and intercession for the righteous, as he had previously pleaded with God to spare the cities if righteous people could be found (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>).<p><b>and all the land of the plain</b><br>The "land of the plain" refers to the Jordan Valley, a fertile and well-watered region that Lot chose for himself when he separated from Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-11</a>). This area was known for its prosperity and agricultural abundance, making the destruction even more significant as it turned a once-thriving region into a desolate wasteland. The judgment on the plain serves as a reminder of the consequences of choosing material prosperity over spiritual integrity.<p><b>and he saw the smoke rising from the land</b><br>The imagery of smoke rising is reminiscent of the aftermath of a great conflagration, indicating total destruction. This visual serves as a powerful symbol of God's wrath and the complete obliteration of sin. The rising smoke can be compared to the smoke of a sacrificial offering, suggesting that the destruction was a form of divine purification. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9</a>, where the smoke of Babylon's destruction is described, drawing a parallel between the judgment of Sodom and the future judgment of the wicked.<p><b>like smoke from a furnace</b><br>The comparison to a furnace emphasizes the intensity and completeness of the destruction. A furnace is used for refining and purifying metals, symbolizing the purging of sin and the refining of God's people. This imagery is also found in <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, where the day of the Lord is described as burning like a furnace, consuming the arrogant and evildoers. The furnace imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ's role in purifying believers, as He refines and purifies His church (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>). The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah serves as a foreshadowing of the final judgment, where Christ will separate the righteous from the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch who interceded for Sodom and Gomorrah, demonstrating his concern for righteousness and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Cities known for their wickedness, which faced divine judgment and destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plain.htm">The Plain</a></b><br>The geographical area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located, known for its fertility before the destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/smoke_rising.htm">Smoke Rising</a></b><br>A symbol of the complete destruction and judgment that befell the cities, akin to smoke from a furnace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment.htm">Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The event of God's wrath being poured out on Sodom and Gomorrah due to their sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah serves as a stark reminder of the seriousness with which God views sin and the inevitable judgment that follows unrepentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercessory_prayer.htm">Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Abraham's role as an intercessor encourages believers to pray earnestly for others, especially those who are lost or living in sin.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>While God is just and must punish sin, He is also merciful and willing to spare the righteous, as seen in His dialogue with Abraham.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_divine_judgment.htm">The Reality of Divine Judgment</a></b><br>The imagery of smoke rising like a furnace is a vivid reminder of the reality of divine judgment, urging believers to live righteously and warn others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_in_expectation.htm">Living in Expectation</a></b><br>Just as the destruction of Sodom was sudden, believers are called to live in expectation of Christ's return, maintaining readiness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_19_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 19:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_19_28_God_s_judgment_mercy_today.htm">How does Genesis 19:28 illustrate God's judgment and mercy in our lives today?

Compare <a href="/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>, where &#8220;Abraham walked with them to see them off,&#8221; and <a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-15</a>, where God told him, &#8220;Lift up your eyes&#8230; for all the land that you see I will give you.&#8221;<p>- The posture of looking down from a height underscores both perspective and distance. Abraham is outside the judgment zone yet wholly aware of what God has done&#8212;echoing <a href="/psalms/91-8.htm">Psalm 91:8</a>, &#8220;You will only see it with your eyes and witness the punishment of the wicked.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Toward Sodom and Gomorrah</b><p>- The focus of Abraham&#8217;s gaze is &#8220;Sodom and Gomorrah&#8221; (19:28 b), cities already notorious for rebellion (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>).<p>- Their story becomes a template for future warnings: <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> calls them &#8220;overthrown like Sodom and Gomorrah,&#8221; and <a href="/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a> says God &#8220;condemned the cities&#8230; making them an example of what is coming on the ungodly.&#8221;<p>- Abraham had pleaded for any righteous within them (<a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>). The fact he must now simply look confirms that divine justice is complete and indisputable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all the land of the plain</b><p>- The devastation extends to &#8220;all the land of the plain&#8221; (19:28 c). This is the very area Lot once chose because it was &#8220;like the garden of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-12</a>).<p>- <a href="/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a> calls it &#8220;the Valley of Siddim,&#8221; a fertile basin now transformed. By including the whole plain, the text shows that unchecked sin poisons surroundings as well as sinners (<a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>).<p>- The total sweep recalls <a href="/jeremiah/50-40.htm">Jeremiah 50:40</a>, where Babylon is warned she will be &#8220;as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he saw</b><p>- &#8220;And he saw&#8221; (19:28 d) confirms that Abraham&#8217;s intercession did not blind him to God&#8217;s holiness.

The imagery recalls <a href="/judges/20-40.htm">Judges 20:40</a>, where a signal column of smoke marks victory over wickedness, and <a href="/revelation/19-3.htm">Revelation 19:3</a>, &#8220;Her smoke rises forever and ever,&#8221; marking irreversible judgment.<p>- Smoke tells of fire already spent&#8212;judgment completed yet consequences ongoing. <a href="/isaiah/34-10.htm">Isaiah 34:10</a> speaks of Edom: &#8220;Its smoke will rise forever.&#8221; The same permanence lies over Sodom&#8217;s ruins.<p>- From a distance, smoke testifies louder than words: sin&#8217;s wage is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like smoke from a furnace</b><p>- The comparison &#8220;like smoke from a furnace&#8221; (19:28 f) stresses volume and density. <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> describes Sinai: &#8220;Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD descended on it in fire.&#8221; Here, similar language marks divine presence in wrath instead of covenant revelation.<p>- <a href="/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a> pictures the abyss opened: &#8220;smoke rose like the smoke of a great furnace.&#8221; Both passages tie furnace-smoke to judgment that no human effort can contain.<p>- The furnace metaphor also hints at purification; <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a> portrays God as a refiner&#8217;s fire. The plain is now scorched clean, Lot is delivered, and Abraham is reminded that God&#8217;s refining can be severe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>- Abraham&#8217;s downward look records fulfilled judgment, affirming God&#8217;s earlier word.<p>- Sodom, Gomorrah, and the entire plain showcase the fate of unrepentant wickedness, becoming Scripture&#8217;s standing warning.<p>- Smoke signals both finality and ongoing testimony; what Abraham saw that dawn still speaks across the Bible, underscoring that God answers intercession, but never at the expense of His righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Lo, the smoke of the country (really, <span class= "ital">land</span>) went up as the smoke of a furnace.</span>--The substitution of the word <span class= "ital">country </span>for <span class= "ital">land </span>is confusing.
