In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing someone's name was often associated with understanding their character or gaining power over them. This encounter occurs after a night of wrestling, symbolizing Jacob's struggle with God and man. The request reflects Jacob's desire for deeper understanding and assurance of the divine nature of his opponent. This moment is pivotal as it follows Jacob's transformation and renaming to Israel, meaning "he struggles with God."<p><b>But he replied, &#8220;Why do you ask my name?&#8221;</b><br>The response to Jacob's question is enigmatic and reflects a common biblical theme where God or His messengers do not reveal their names. This is seen in other instances, such as <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-18</a>, where the angel of the Lord tells Manoah that His name is "beyond understanding." The question implies that the name is either too sacred or beyond human comprehension. It emphasizes the mystery and transcendence of God, reminding Jacob and the readers that God's ways and identity are not fully graspable by human understanding.<p><b>Then he blessed Jacob there.</b><br>The blessing Jacob receives is a confirmation of the promises God made to him and his forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. This blessing is significant as it marks a turning point in Jacob's life, symbolizing his transformation and the fulfillment of God's covenant. The location of the blessing, Peniel, meaning "face of God," underscores the divine encounter. This blessing also prefigures the blessings found in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises. Jacob's experience foreshadows the spiritual blessings believers receive through Jesus, who reconciles humanity with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who wrestles with a divine being.

Asking for the name is Jacob&#8217;s way of pursuing fuller revelation&#8212;just as Moses later asks, &#8220;What is His name?&#8221; in <a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13-14</a>, and Manoah in <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a> does the same.<p>&#8226; In Scripture a name reveals character and authority; knowing it implies relationship. Jacob, newly renamed &#8220;Israel,&#8221; wants to know the identity of the One who has just redefined his own.<p>&#8226; The request also shows faith; Jacob believes that the Person before him has the right to bless and to rename (compare <a href="/genesis/27-26.htm">Genesis 27:26-29</a>, where Jacob once sought blessing through deception).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he replied, &#8220;Why do you ask my name?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical. The Lord often withholds His name to emphasize His transcendence, as seen again in <a href="/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a>&#8212;&#8220;It is wonderful&#8221;&#8212;and echoed by <a href="/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>, which asks, &#8220;What is His name, and what is the name of His Son&#8212;surely you know!&#8221;<p>&#8226; By not disclosing the name, God reminds Jacob&#8212;and us&#8212;that no demand can force divine self-revelation. <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a> underscores this gap: &#8220;My thoughts are higher than your thoughts.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The response also redirects focus from curiosity to transformation. Jacob has already received the vital revelation he needs: a new identity (Israel) and confirmation of covenant favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he blessed Jacob there.</b><p>&#8226; The unstated name does not hinder God&#8217;s grace; instead, blessing flows immediately. That blessing fulfills earlier promises to Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>; 26:24) and prefigures the reaffirmation Jacob will receive at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a> looks back on this moment, noting that Jacob &#8220;wept and sought His favor,&#8221; highlighting repentant dependence rather than self-reliance.<p>&#8226; The location&#8212;&#8220;there,&#8221; at the very place of wrestling&#8212;shows that encounters with God&#8217;s holiness and personal weakness often become the birthplace of greatest blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jacob&#8217;s plea for the stranger&#8217;s name reveals his desire for intimacy with the One who has just wrestled, wounded, and renamed him. God&#8217;s gentle refusal, &#8220;Why do you ask my name?&#8221; reminds Jacob that the Lord remains sovereign over His own self-disclosure. Yet the withheld name does not dampen covenant kindness; God immediately bestows the blessing Jacob once tried to steal, confirming that true favor comes not by grasping but by grace received in humility.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Wherefore . . . --</span>In much the same manner the angel refuses to tell Manoah his name (<a href="/judges/13-18.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?">Judges 13:18</a>).
