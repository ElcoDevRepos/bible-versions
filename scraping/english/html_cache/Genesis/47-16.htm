This request reflects the economic practices of the time, where livestock was a valuable asset. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, livestock represented wealth and sustenance. Joseph's strategy ensures that the people have food while maintaining the economic stability of Egypt. This also foreshadows the later development of a more centralized economy under Pharaoh's control.<p><b>said Joseph.</b><br>Joseph, a Hebrew who rose to power in Egypt, is a type of Christ in his role as a savior during the famine. His wisdom and discernment are evident as he navigates the crisis. Joseph's leadership is a fulfillment of the dreams he had as a youth, where he saw his family bowing to him, symbolizing his authority and provision.<p><b>Since the money is gone,</b><br>The depletion of money indicates the severity of the famine and the desperation of the people. This situation highlights the limitations of material wealth in times of crisis. It also sets the stage for a shift from a monetary economy to a barter system, which was common in ancient times when currency was scarce.<p><b>I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.</b><br>Joseph's proposal is both practical and compassionate. By accepting livestock, he provides a means for the people to survive while also ensuring that Egypt's resources are not depleted. This exchange system reflects the economic adaptations necessary during prolonged famines. It also demonstrates Joseph's role as a wise steward, ensuring that both the people and the state are sustained. This act of provision can be seen as a parallel to Christ's provision for humanity, offering sustenance and life in times of spiritual famine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

Livestock were valuable for plowing, transportation, milk, wool, and future food. Compare Job&#8217;s wealth in animals (<a href="/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>) and Abram&#8217;s prosperity (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently underscores stewardship of resources: &#8220;Go to the ant&#8230; and be wise&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>). Joseph&#8217;s proposal is not exploitation but orderly stewardship under Pharaoh for the survival of the nation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Since the money is gone</b><p>&#8220;Since the money is gone&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The text states the obvious economic reality&#8212;cash is exhausted. Joseph acknowledges facts and adjusts policy, a model echoed later: Elijah&#8217;s widow collects jars when oil is all she has left (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Material reserves fail, yet God remains faithful. The Lord taught Israel to rely on manna daily (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-18</a>), and Jesus reminds us, &#8220;Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>). The verse illustrates that earthly currency is finite, pushing hearts to depend on divine provision.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s transparency guards against accusations of hidden motives; he communicates conditions clearly, reflecting integrity commanded in <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Joseph sets a fair barter: life-sustaining grain for animals that now consume scarce fodder. By relocating livestock to Pharaoh&#8217;s care (<a href="/genesis/47-17.htm">Genesis 47:17</a>), animals survive, fields avoid overgrazing, and people eat&#8212;a win-win settlement.<p>&#8226; God often works salvation through exchange: Joseph&#8217;s earlier suffering secured Egypt&#8217;s storehouses; Christ&#8217;s righteousness is traded for our sin (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The policy preserves societal order. Without food distribution, chaos and violence loom (compare <a href="/genesis/47-19.htm">Genesis 47:19</a>). <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a> affirms governing authority as God&#8217;s servant &#8220;for your good.&#8221; Joseph embodies that role under Pharaoh.<p>&#8226; Long-term, the exchange weaves Egypt&#8217;s economy into a centralized system that later blesses Israel with Goshen pasture (<a href="/genesis/47-27.htm">Genesis 47:27</a>) and fulfills God&#8217;s promise to Abram of a temporary sojourn (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-16.htm">Genesis 47:16</a> records Joseph&#8217;s God-given strategy during extreme famine: when cash dried up, he invited Egyptians to barter livestock for grain, safeguarding both people and animals. The verse showcases practical stewardship, transparent leadership, and God&#8217;s faithful provision through wise administration, all working toward His larger redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>JOSEPH'S POLICY IN EGYPT.</span><p>(16) <span class= "bld">Give your cattle.</span>--As the people were in want of food, and their land incapable of cultivation as long as the Nile ceased to overflow, this was a merciful arrangement, by which the owners were delivered from a burden, and also a portion of the cattle saved for the time when they would be needed again for agricultural purposes.
