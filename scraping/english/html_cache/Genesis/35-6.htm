It reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Near Eastern societies, where the head of the family led and made decisions for the entire group. This journey follows God's command to Jacob to return to Bethel, a place of significant spiritual encounters. The unity of the group underscores the importance of communal faith and obedience in the biblical narrative.<p><b>arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel)</b><br>Luz, later known as Bethel, is a significant location in Jacob's life. It is where he previously had a vision of a ladder reaching to heaven and received God's promises (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-19</a>). The renaming of Luz to Bethel, meaning "House of God," signifies a transformation and consecration of the place due to Jacob's encounter with God. This site becomes a central place of worship and remembrance for Jacob and his descendants. The dual naming highlights the continuity and change in Jacob's spiritual journey.<p><b>in the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). It is a region of great significance in biblical history, representing the fulfillment of God's covenant promises. The mention of Canaan situates the narrative within the broader context of God's redemptive plan for His people. It is a land marked by both divine promise and human conflict, serving as the backdrop for many key events in Israel's history. The arrival in Canaan signifies a return to the land of promise and a step towards the establishment of Israel as a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite nation, Jacob is returning to Bethel, a place of significant spiritual encounters in his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/luz/bethel.htm">Luz/Bethel</a></b><br>Originally called Luz, this location is renamed Bethel by Jacob, meaning "House of God."

The whole community is in view, underscoring several truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s commands embrace households, not isolated individuals (compare <a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1&#8211;2</a>; <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob leads spiritually and physically. Earlier he told his family, &#8220;Get rid of the foreign gods&#8230; purify yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>), modeling obedience before arrival.<p>&#8226; The safe passage of the group fulfills the Lord&#8217;s earlier promise: &#8220;I will be with you and will keep you wherever you go&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>), echoed again at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Their unity after the turmoil of Shechem (<a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>) highlights how repentance and renewed worship restore family cohesion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel)</b><p>Luz was the Canaanite name; Bethel (&#8220;house of God&#8221;) is Jacob&#8217;s name for the place where God appeared to him twenty years earlier (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). Coming back signals:<p>&#8226; Vow fulfillment&#8212;Jacob had pledged, &#8220;This stone&#8230; will be God&#8217;s house&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>). Now he returns to honor that promise.<p>&#8226; Memorial of grace&#8212;God identified Himself as &#8220;the God of Bethel&#8221; while Jacob was still with Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>). The same God meets him again.<p>&#8226; Transformation&#8212;what was once a pagan site (&#8220;Luz&#8221;) becomes synonymous with worship (&#8220;Bethel&#8221;). It&#8217;s a snapshot of how God redeems places and people (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing&#8212;later generations would remember Bethel as a place of divine encounter (<a href="/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>), though misuse of it also warns against empty ritual (<a href="/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land of Canaan</b><p>The phrase roots the event in covenant geography:<p>&#8226; Canaan is the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; 26:3; 28:13). Jacob&#8217;s arrival confirms God&#8217;s unwavering plan.<p>&#8226; It marks the completion of Jacob&#8217;s exile. After twenty years in Paddan-Aram and a tense stop in Shechem, he now occupies the heartland of promise (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>; 35:27).<p>&#8226; The return anticipates Israel&#8217;s later pilgrimages: Jacob&#8217;s descendants will exit to Egypt, wander in the wilderness, and finally re-enter Canaan under Joshua (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the land, Scripture stresses the tangible, historical nature of God&#8217;s work. These are real places with real boundaries, reinforcing the literal reliability of the narrative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6</a> records more than a travel log. It shows a redeemed family, led by a chastened patriarch, stepping into the very spot where God first promised to keep him. Luz becomes Bethel again, pagan soil becomes holy ground, and the covenant line stands inside the land sworn to them. The verse assures us that when God calls, protects, and guides, He also brings His people safely home to the place of promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Jacob came to Luz</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>), <span class="cmt_word">which is in the land of Canaan</span> (this clause is added to draw attention to the fact that Jacob had now accomplished his return to Canaan), <span class="cmt_word">that</span> is, <span class="cmt_word">Bethel, he and all the people that were with him</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his household and the captured Shechemites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/35-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and everyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
