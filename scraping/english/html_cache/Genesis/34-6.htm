It suggests that while other actions were taking place, such as Dinah's brothers hearing of her defilement, another significant event was occurring. This sets the stage for the unfolding narrative and highlights the urgency and complexity of the situation.<p><b>Shechem&#8217;s father Hamor</b><br>Hamor is introduced as the father of Shechem, the man who defiled Dinah. The name Hamor means "donkey" in Hebrew, which may imply strength or stubbornness. Hamor is a Hivite, a group of Canaanite people, indicating the cultural and religious differences between Jacob's family and the inhabitants of the land. This sets up a contrast between the covenant people of God and the surrounding nations.<p><b>came to speak</b><br>Hamor's action of coming to speak with Jacob suggests a formal approach to negotiate or resolve the situation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such negotiations were common in resolving disputes or arranging marriages. This reflects the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in maintaining peace and relationships between different groups.<p><b>with Jacob</b><br>Jacob, the patriarch of the Israelite family, is the central figure in this narrative. His role as the head of the family places him in a position of authority and responsibility. The meeting with Hamor underscores the gravity of the situation, as it involves the honor and future of Jacob's family. Jacob's response and decisions will have significant implications for his descendants and their relationship with the surrounding peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A Hivite prince who defiled Dinah, Jacob's daughter.

(<a href="/genesis/34-5.htm">Genesis 34:5</a>).<p>- Scripture is portraying an actual historical pause&#8212;Jacob is waiting, Dinah is still defiled, and tension fills the camp.<p>- Similar narrative pivots appear in <a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a> (&#8220;Then the LORD said, &#8216;I will surely return to you at this time next year&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;), showing how God-authored accounts move purposefully from scene to scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shechem&#8217;s father Hamor</b><p>- Hamor is introduced not merely as a local chieftain but as the covenant-outsider whose household has offended Jacob&#8217;s family (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>).<p>- His paternal identity matters; fathers in Genesis routinely represent and negotiate for their households (<a href="/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; 29:19).<p>- The verse reminds us that generational leadership holds responsibility, echoing <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a> where fathers&#8217; actions affect descendants.<p>- Though pagan, Hamor bears God-given authority within his clan, showing that all human structures remain under divine observance (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Came to speak</b><p>- Hamor takes the initiative, a diplomatic move that resembles Abraham&#8217;s negotiations with Ephron the Hittite in <a href="/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7-11</a>.<p>- The verb &#8220;came&#8221; underscores physical movement into Jacob&#8217;s space, indicating a real meeting, not symbolism.<p>- His goal&#8212;&#8220;to speak&#8221;&#8212;suggests a formal parley, paralleling later peace talks such as <a href="/joshua/9-15.htm">Joshua 9:15</a> with the Gibeonites.<p>- Notice the contrast: Hamor intends conversation while Simeon and Levi later choose violence (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>), highlighting divergent paths of conflict resolution.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With Jacob</b><p>- Jacob is the covenant bearer (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>); engaging him is tantamount to addressing the family&#8217;s spiritual head.<p>- Hamor bypasses Jacob&#8217;s sons initially; the patriarchal order remains respected even by outsiders (cf. <a href="/genesis/47-5.htm">Genesis 47:5-6</a> where Pharaoh speaks directly to Joseph).<p>- This face-to-face meeting foreshadows the accountability non-believers must render before God&#8217;s people, echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/5-10.htm">1 Samuel 5:10-12</a> when Philistines confront Israel&#8217;s God through His ark.<p>- It also sets the stage for Jacob&#8217;s later grief over his sons&#8217; rash vengeance (<a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>), reminding readers that leadership must weigh every response before God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6</a> records a literal historical moment: while Jacob waits in turmoil, Hamor, as responsible father of the offender, arrives to negotiate. The verse underscores (1) God&#8217;s orderly timeline, (2) the weight of paternal authority, (3) contrasting methods of conflict resolution, and (4) covenant accountability. By spotlighting this brief encounter, Scripture affirms that every human meeting&#8212;especially between God&#8217;s people and the world&#8212;carries spiritual consequence and calls for righteous discernment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (meantime) <span class="cmt_word">Hamor the father of Shechem went out</span> - accompanied by Shechem (ver. 11) - <span class="cmt_word">unto Jacob</span> - who was encamped in the outskirts of the city (<a href="/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">to commune with him</span> concerning Dinah's marriage with his son. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Meanwhile, Shechem&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7927.htm">Strong's 7927: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shechem -- 'ridge', a district in Northern Palestine, also a son of Hamor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hamor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2544.htm">Strong's 2544: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hamor -- father of Shechem</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1435;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to speak</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jacob.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/34-6.htm">Genesis 34:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/34-6.htm">OT Law: Genesis 34:6 Hamor the father of Shechem went out (Gen.
