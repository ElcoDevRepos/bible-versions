The description of Leah's eyes as "weak" may imply that they lacked the brightness or attractiveness that was culturally valued. This could have affected her desirability as a bride, especially in comparison to her sister Rachel. The Hebrew term used here can also mean "delicate" or "tender," suggesting a contrast to Rachel's more striking appearance. Leah's situation highlights themes of God's sovereignty and grace, as despite her perceived disadvantage, she becomes the mother of Judah, from whom the line of David and ultimately Jesus Christ descends.<p><b>but Rachel was shapely and beautiful</b><br>Rachel's physical attractiveness is emphasized, indicating her favorable position in terms of marriageability. Her beauty is noted in two aspects: form and appearance, suggesting she was both physically well-proportioned and visually appealing. This sets the stage for Jacob's deep love for her, which becomes a central theme in the narrative. The preference for Rachel over Leah by Jacob also reflects the human tendency to value external appearances, a theme that is contrasted with God's focus on the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. Rachel's beauty and Jacob's love for her lead to significant family dynamics and tensions, which play a crucial role in the unfolding of God's plan for the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The elder daughter of Laban, described as having "weak eyes."
