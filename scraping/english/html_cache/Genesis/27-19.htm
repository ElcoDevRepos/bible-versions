Jacob, whose name means "supplanter" or "deceiver," is fulfilling the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a> that the older would serve the younger. The cultural significance of the firstborn in ancient Near Eastern societies was profound, as the firstborn son typically received a double portion of the inheritance and the father's blessing, which was both a spiritual and material endowment. This act of deception foreshadows the later struggles between the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and Esau (Edom).<p><b>I have done as you told me.</b><br>Jacob's claim here is a direct lie, as it was Rebekah who orchestrated the plan to deceive Isaac, and Jacob is complicit in carrying it out. This reflects the theme of human manipulation versus divine sovereignty, as God's purposes are ultimately fulfilled despite human deceit. The phrase also highlights the importance of obedience in the biblical narrative, albeit here it is falsely claimed.<p><b>Please sit up and eat some of my game,</b><br>The request for Isaac to sit up and eat is significant in the context of the blessing ceremony. In ancient times, meals often accompanied significant covenantal or familial events. The act of eating together was a sign of fellowship and agreement. The reference to "game" is ironic, as the meat was actually from the flock, not wild game, further emphasizing the deception.<p><b>so that you may bless me.&#8221;</b><br>The blessing Jacob seeks is not merely a paternal wish but a prophetic pronouncement that would shape the future of nations. In the biblical context, blessings were considered irrevocable and carried divine authority. This blessing was intended for Esau, but Jacob's acquisition of it aligns with God's sovereign plan as revealed earlier to Rebekah. The blessing itself is a type of Christ, as it points to the ultimate blessing and inheritance found in Jesus, the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who deceives his father to receive the blessing meant for his brother Esau.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder twin brother of Jacob, known for being a skillful hunter and the rightful recipient of Isaac's blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The father of Jacob and Esau, who is old and blind, and intends to bless Esau.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Jacob and Esau, who orchestrates the deception to ensure Jacob receives the blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blessing.htm">The Blessing</a></b><br>A significant event where Isaac intends to bestow a prophetic and patriarchal blessing upon his firstborn, Esau.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Jacob's deceitful actions, though successful in the short term, lead to long-term family strife and personal challenges.

in doing so he rejects God&#8217;s path of truth even while seeking God&#8217;s promised blessing (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; An echo of later deceptions: similar identity masking appears with Joseph&#8217;s brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-31.htm">Genesis 37:31-33</a>) and Tamar (<a href="/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14-15</a>).<p>Though Scripture records the lie, it never condones it;

The statement presumes an authority he does not possess; true obedience is rooted in truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The irony: in professing obedience, Jacob is violating both his father&#8217;s trust and God&#8217;s moral law (<a href="/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please sit up and eat some of my game</b><p>The physical act of eating was tied to covenant blessing.<p>&#8226;

The request highlights the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility (<a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God redeems even twisted motives: though the method was sinful, the blessing stands because God&#8217;s gifts are irrevocable (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-19.htm">Genesis 27:19</a> captures Jacob&#8217;s fourfold deception&#8212;identity, obedience, provision, and purpose&#8212;each layer exposing human frailty while advancing God&#8217;s unbreakable promise. The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s plans prevail, yet the means we choose matter; deceit breeds sorrow, truth brings peace, and the blessing ultimately rests on divine grace, not human scheming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Arise </span>. . . <span class= "bld">sit and eat.</span>--The Hebrews at this time, and for centuries, sat at their meals (<a href="/1_samuel/20-25.htm" title="And the king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty.">1Samuel 20:25</a>). It was from the Romans that they learned to recline at table, as we find was their custom in the Gospels. It is a mistake, moreover, to suppose that Isaac was a bedridden old man, for Jacob bids him arise and seat himself. Nor does he help him, though his sight was weak.
