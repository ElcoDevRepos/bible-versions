It suggests a period during which Joseph proved his reliability and integrity. The passage of time is often significant in biblical narratives, marking periods of testing or preparation, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures like Moses and David.<p><b>his master&#8217;s wife</b><br>Potiphar's wife is unnamed, which is common in biblical narratives where the focus is on the actions and character of the main figures. Her role in the story highlights the theme of temptation and moral testing. In ancient Egyptian society, women of high status, like Potiphar's wife, had significant influence within the household, though they were still subject to the authority of their husbands.<p><b>cast her eyes upon Joseph</b><br>This phrase indicates a deliberate and possibly prolonged attention, suggesting desire and intent. In biblical literature, the eyes are often symbolic of desire or covetousness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a> with Eve and the forbidden fruit. Joseph's physical appearance is noted earlier in the chapter, emphasizing his attractiveness and the potential for temptation.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Sleep with me.&#8221;</b><br>The directness of the proposition underscores the boldness and impropriety of Potiphar's wife's actions. In the cultural context of the time, such a proposition would have been scandalous and a serious breach of social and marital norms. Joseph's refusal, which follows in the narrative, highlights his commitment to righteousness and loyalty to his master, prefiguring the moral integrity of Christ, who resisted temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers and became a servant in the house of Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh.
