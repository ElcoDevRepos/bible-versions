This mirrors his earlier vision at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>), reinforcing God's presence and protection. Angels often appear at pivotal moments, as seen with Abraham (Genesis 18) and later with Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). This encounter reassures Jacob of divine support as he prepares to meet Esau.<p><b>he said, &#8220;This is the camp of God.&#8221;</b><br>The term "camp" suggests a temporary dwelling, indicating a divine presence accompanying Jacob. The Hebrew word "machaneh" implies a military encampment, symbolizing God's protection. This reflects the idea of God as a warrior, a theme seen in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>. The presence of angels signifies God's readiness to defend and guide His people.<p><b>So he named that place Mahanaim.</b><br>Mahanaim means "two camps," possibly referring to Jacob's camp and the angelic host. This duality underscores the coexistence of the earthly and the divine. Mahanaim later becomes a significant location in Israel's history, serving as a refuge for David (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). The naming of places often marks significant spiritual encounters, as seen with Bethel and Peniel, highlighting God's ongoing relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.

Mahanaim, afterwards a distinguished city in the territory of Gad (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), and frequently referred to in subsequent Scripture (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>; 27; 19:32; <a href="/1_kings/4-14.htm">1 Kings 4:14</a>), as well as mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 7.9, 8), as a strong and beautiful city, has been identified with Mahneh, a deserted ruin six or seven miles north-west by north of Ajlun (Mount Gilead), and about twenty miles from the Jabbok (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Robinson,' vol. 3. App. 166; and cf. Tristram, 'The Land of Israel, p. 483); but the narrative appears to say that Mahanaim lay not north of Ga-leed, but between that place and Jabbok.
