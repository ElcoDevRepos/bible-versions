In biblical context, covenants are pivotal, marking significant relationships between God and humanity. This is the first explicit mention of a covenant in the Bible, setting a precedent for future covenants with figures like Abraham, Moses, and David. The covenant with Noah is unconditional, emphasizing God's grace and faithfulness. It foreshadows the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, highlighting themes of salvation and divine promise.<p><b>and you will enter the ark</b><br>The ark is a symbol of salvation and divine protection. In a historical and cultural context, the ark represents God's provision amidst judgment. The construction of the ark, as described earlier in Genesis, reflects ancient shipbuilding techniques, though its dimensions and design are unique, underscoring its divine origin. The ark prefigures Christ as the means of salvation, offering refuge from the judgment of sin.<p><b>you and your sons and your wife and your sons&#8217; wives with you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the inclusion of Noah's family in God's plan of salvation, highlighting the importance of family in God's redemptive work. It reflects the biblical principle of household salvation, seen later in the stories of Rahab and the Philippian jailer. The inclusion of Noah's family also underscores the communal aspect of God's covenant, extending blessings and responsibilities to future generations. This anticipates the broader inclusion of all nations in the New Covenant through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Creator who initiates a covenant with Noah, demonstrating His grace and faithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and preserve humanity and animal life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah's_family.htm">Noah's Family</a></b><br>Includes Noah's wife, his sons (Shem, Ham, and Japheth), and their wives, who are to be saved from the flood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark.htm">The Ark</a></b><br>The vessel built by Noah according to God's instructions, serving as a means of salvation from the impending flood.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>A divine promise made by God to Noah, signifying a binding agreement and assurance of protection and future blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's covenant with Noah underscores His unwavering faithfulness and commitment to His promises.

His covenant with Noah underscores grace over merit, obedience born of faith, and salvation that embraces whole households. As the ark shielded Noah&#8217;s family, so Christ shelters all who trust Him, proving that God&#8217;s unfailing covenant love endures from the first book of the Bible to the last.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">My covenant.</span>--There had been no covenant with Adam or with the Sethites, but in the higher state of things which began with Noah, man was to hold a more exactly defined relation to God; and though they had begun to attach the notion of Deity to the name Jehovah in the days of Enos (<a href="/genesis/4-26.htm" title="And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call on the name of the LORD.">Genesis 4:26</a>), yet it was not till the time of Moses that it became the distinct title of God in covenant with man. Of this relation a necessary result was revelation, as in no other way could there be a communication between the two contracting parties. Hence the Bible is called "The Old and New Covenant," or "The Old and New Testament," the Greek term being of wider meaning than either word with us, and signifying either an agreement between the living or the document by which a testator disposes of his property after his death (<a href="/context/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16-17</a>). The title of covenant is more applicable to the Scriptures of the prior dispensation, which contain a series of such relations, all preparing for the last and best and most perfect, which was a Testament ratified in the blood of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But with thee will I establish my covenant</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.; <span class="accented">foe</span>-<span class="accented">due</span>, Vulgate; <span class="accented">testamentum</span>, N.T.), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, to cut or carve; hence a covenant, from the custom of passing between the divided pieces of the victims slain on the occasion of making such solemn compacts (cf. <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9</a>; Gesenius); from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, to eat, hence an eating together, a banquet (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; Lee).
