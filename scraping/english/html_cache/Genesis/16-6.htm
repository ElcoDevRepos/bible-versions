In the ancient Near Eastern context, a servant or slave was considered the property of their master or mistress, and decisions regarding them were often made by the head of the household. Abram's statement also indicates a relinquishing of responsibility, which can be seen as a lack of leadership in addressing the conflict between Sarai and Hagar. This moment foreshadows the later struggles within Abram's family, highlighting the consequences of human decisions outside of God's direct guidance.<p><b>Do whatever you want with her.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the power dynamics and social hierarchy of the time. Sarai, as the mistress, had the authority to decide Hagar's fate. The lack of intervention by Abram suggests a passive approach to resolving family disputes, which can be contrasted with later biblical figures who actively seek God's guidance in difficult situations. This moment also reflects the broader biblical theme of human free will and its potential for both good and harm.<p><b>Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.</b><br>Sarai's harsh treatment of Hagar is indicative of the tension and jealousy that arose from Hagar's pregnancy. This act of mistreatment is a turning point in the narrative, leading to Hagar's flight into the wilderness. The harshness can be seen as a reflection of Sarai's own insecurities and frustrations, as well as the broader theme of suffering and oppression found throughout Scripture. Hagar's flight is significant as it sets the stage for her encounter with the angel of the Lord, a moment of divine intervention and promise. This event also prefigures the Exodus narrative, where God's people flee from oppression and are guided by divine presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Hebrew people, later named Abraham.
