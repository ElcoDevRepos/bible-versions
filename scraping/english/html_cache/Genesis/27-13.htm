Her involvement in the deception of Isaac highlights the complex family dynamics and favoritism present in the patriarchal narratives. Rebekah's actions can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to her during her pregnancy (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), where it was foretold that the older would serve the younger.<p><b>&#8220;Your curse be on me, my son.</b><br>Rebekah takes full responsibility for the potential consequences of the deception. This reflects the cultural context where a curse was a serious matter, often believed to have tangible effects. Her willingness to bear the curse underscores her determination to see Jacob receive the blessing, which she believes is his rightful due. This phrase also foreshadows the later separation between Jacob and Rebekah, as Jacob flees to avoid Esau's wrath, and they never see each other again.<p><b>Just obey my voice</b><br>Rebekah's insistence on obedience highlights the authority of parental figures in ancient Near Eastern culture. This command echoes the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's voice, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience to God's commands.<p><b>and go get them for me.&#8221;</b><br>Rebekah instructs Jacob to fetch the goats, which will be used to deceive Isaac into giving Jacob the blessing meant for Esau. This act of deception is pivotal in the narrative, leading to Jacob's eventual journey and transformation. The use of goats is significant, as goats were common in sacrificial practices, and this deception can be seen as a perversion of the sacrificial system. This event sets the stage for Jacob's later encounters with God, where he learns the importance of integrity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

The verse warns that even earnest intentions can stray from God&#8217;s righteousness, foreshadows the true Substitute who will bear the curse, and illustrates how quickly sin moves from conversation to action.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Upon me be thy curse.</span>--No curse followed upon their conduct; but, on the contrary, Isaac acknowledged the substantial justice of the act of Rebekah and her son, and confirmed Jacob in the possession of the blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-33.htm" title="And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.">Genesis 27:33</a>).
