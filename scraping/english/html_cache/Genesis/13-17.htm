Walking the land was a symbolic act of taking possession, a common ancient Near Eastern practice. It reflects a tangible expression of faith, similar to <a href="/joshua/1-3.htm">Joshua 1:3</a>, where God tells Joshua that every place he sets his foot will be given to him. This act of walking is a precursor to the Israelites' later conquest and settlement of Canaan.<p><b>through its length and breadth</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the vastness of the land promised to Abram. It underscores the comprehensive nature of God's promise, extending in all directions. This promise of land is central to the Abrahamic Covenant, which is foundational to the narrative of the Israelites. The land of Canaan, later known as Israel, holds significant historical and theological importance, being the stage for much of biblical history.<p><b>for I will give it to you.</b><br>This promise is a divine assurance of God's faithfulness and sovereignty. It is a unilateral promise, not contingent on Abram's actions but solely on God's will. This promise is reiterated throughout Genesis (e.g., <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18, 17</a>:8) and is a key element of God's covenant with Abram. It foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in the coming of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the true heir of all God's promises (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>). The land promise also points to the eschatological hope of a new creation, where God's people will dwell with Him eternally.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is called by God to walk the land that will be given to him and his descendants.
