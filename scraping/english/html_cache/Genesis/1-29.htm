In the creation narrative, God's speech is the means by which creation is ordered and sustained. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the creative power of His word, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the Word is identified with Christ, through whom all things were made.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, I have given you</b><br>The use of "behold" draws attention to the significance of the gift being bestowed. This phrase underscores God's provision and generosity towards humanity. It reflects the biblical theme of God as the provider, seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/104-14.htm">Psalm 104:14-15</a>, where God provides for all living creatures.<p><b>every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth,</b><br>This indicates the abundance and variety of God's provision. The mention of "seed-bearing" plants highlights the potential for reproduction and sustainability, ensuring a continuous supply of food. This provision is universal, covering "all the earth," which speaks to the comprehensive nature of God's care for creation.<p><b>and every tree whose fruit contains seed.</b><br>The focus on trees with seed-bearing fruit further emphasizes the theme of abundance and the natural order established by God. This provision is not only for sustenance but also for the perpetuation of life. The imagery of trees bearing fruit is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where the righteous are likened to a fruitful tree.<p><b>They will be yours for food.</b><br>This phrase establishes the intended use of the plants and trees: to sustain human life. It reflects the initial vegetarian diet prescribed for humanity, which is later expanded in <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a> after the flood. This provision also points to God's care and the intended harmony between humans and the rest of creation, a theme that is disrupted by the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who provides for His creation, demonstrating His sovereignty and care.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam_and_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a></b><br>The first humans, representing humanity, who are the recipients of God's provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The setting of God's creation, filled with seed-bearing plants and trees for sustenance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God bringing the universe and all life into existence, culminating in His provision for humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/seed-bearing_plants_and_trees.htm">Seed-bearing plants and trees</a></b><br>The means through which God provides food, emphasizing the abundance and sustainability of His creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate provider of all our needs, both physical and spiritual.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sustainability_and_stewardship.htm">Sustainability and Stewardship</a></b><br>Understand the importance of caring for creation as stewards of God's provision, ensuring its sustainability for future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_care.htm">Trust in God's Care</a></b><br>Develop a deeper trust in God's provision, knowing that He cares for all His creation and will meet our needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_for_abundance.htm">Gratitude for Abundance</a></b><br>Cultivate a heart of gratitude for the abundance God has provided, acknowledging His generosity and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/healthy_living.htm">Healthy Living</a></b><br>Consider the implications of God's original provision of plant-based food for healthy living and well-being.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_29_God_s_dietary_provision.htm">How does Genesis 1:29 emphasize God's provision for humanity's dietary needs?

We are not to suppose that they did not eat seeds and fruits, but that the fundamental supply for the maintenance of animal life was the blade and leaf, and that of human life the perfected seed and ripe fruit. Man is thus from the first pointed out as of a higher organisation than the animal; and the fact that his food is such as requires preparation and cooking has been the basis, not merely of most of the refinements of life, but even of the close union of the family. For what would become of it without the common meal?<p>But undoubtedly the food originally assigned to man was vegetable; nor was express leave given to eat flesh until after the flood. Nevertheless the dominion given to man, in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>, over fish, bird, and animal, made it lawful for him to use them for his food; and the skins with which Adam and Eve were clothed on their expulsion from Paradise prove that animals had been already killed. After the fall, Abel's sacrifice of the firstlings of his flock, and <span class= "ital">of the fat thereof, </span>leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the flesh was eaten by the offerer and his family. In ancient times this was the rule. Flesh was not the staple of man's diet, but the eating of it was a religious ceremony, at which certain portions were offered to God and burnt on His altar, and the rest consumed by man as the Deity's guests. So we may well believe that until the flood the descendants of Seth partook of flesh rarely, and only at a sacrifice, but that after the flood a more free use of it was permitted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - Provision for the sustenance of the newly-appointed monarch and his subjects is next made. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</span> Of the three classes into which the vegetable creation was divided, grass, herbs, and trees (ver. 12), the two last were assigned to man for food. Macdonald thinks that without this express conveyance man would have been warranted to partake of them for nourishment, warranted by the necessities of his nature. The same reasoning, however, would have entitled him to kill the lower animals if he judged them useful for his support. Murphy with more truth remarks, "Of two things proceeding from the same creative hand, neither has any original or inherent right to interfere in any way with the other. The absolute right to each lies in the Creator alone. The one, it is true, may need the other to support its life, as fruit is needful to man; and, therefore, the just Creator cannot make one creature dependent for subsistence on another without granting to it the use of that other. But this is a matter between Creator and creature, and not by any means between creature and creature." The primitive charter of man's common property in the earth, and all that it contains, is the present section of this ancient document. Among other reasons for the formal conveyance to man of the herbs and trees may be noted a desire to keep him mindful of his dependent condition. Though lord of the creation, he was yet to draw the means of his subsistence from the creature which he ruled. Whether man was a vegetarian prior to the fall is debated. On the one hand it is contended that the original grant does not formally exclude the animals, and, in fact, says nothing about man's relation to the animals (Macdonald); that we cannot positively affirm that man's dominion over the animals did not involve the use of them for food (Murphy); and that as men offered sacrifices from their flocks, it is probable they ate the flesh of the victims (Calvin), On the other hand it is argued that the Divine language cannot be held as importing morn than it really says, arid that <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a> distinctly teaches that man's right to the animal creation dates from the time of Noah (Kalisch, Knobel, Alford, etc.). Almost all nations have traditions of a golden age of innocence, when men abstained from killing animals (cf. Ovid, 'Met.,' 1:103-106).
