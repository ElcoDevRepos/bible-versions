Noah is described as a righteous man in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, setting him apart in a corrupt world. This divine communication underscores the biblical theme of God revealing His plans to His chosen servants, as seen with figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p><b>The end of all living creatures has come before Me</b><br>This declaration signifies God's judgment on the pervasive wickedness of humanity. The phrase "come before Me" suggests that God is fully aware of the extent of human corruption. This echoes the divine assessment of human sinfulness in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, where every inclination of the human heart was only evil continually. It foreshadows the eschatological judgment seen in <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-15</a>.<p><b>because through them the earth is full of violence</b><br>The term "violence" (Hebrew: "hamas") indicates moral corruption and social injustice. This reflects the breakdown of the created order, where humanity's role as stewards of creation (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>) has been perverted. The prevalence of violence is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, such as in the warnings of the prophets (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/59-6.htm">Isaiah 59:6-8</a>).<p><b>Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth</b><br>This pronouncement of destruction is a divine response to the corruption and violence filling the earth. The Hebrew word for "destroy" (shachath) can also mean "corrupt," indicating a reversal of creation. This prefigures the final judgment and renewal of creation described in <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10-13</a>.

Literally, <span class="accented">and behold me destroying them</span>. The verb is the same as is translated "corrupt' in ver. 12, q.v., as if to convey the idea of fitting retribution (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <a href="/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>). Whether this destruction which was threatened against the antediluvian sinners ex tended to the loss of their souls throughout eternity may be reasoned (<span class="accented">pro</span> and con) from other Scriptures, but cannot be determined from this place, which refers solely to the-extinction of their bodily lives. <span class="cmt_word">With the earth</span>. Not <span class="accented">from</span> the earth (Samaritan), or on the earth (Syriac, Rosenm&uuml;ller), or even the earth, "thus identifying the earth with its inhabitants" (Bush), but, together with the earth (Kalisch, Keil, Alford; cf. <a href="/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11</a>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). The universality of representation which characterizes this section (vers. 9-13) is regarded by Davidson, Colenso, and others as contradictory of <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>, which depicts the corruption as <span class="accented">only human</span>, and limits the destruction to the race of man. But as the two accounts belong to different subdivisions of the book, they cannot properly be viewed as contradictory (cf. 'Quarry on Genesis,' pp. 370, 371). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
