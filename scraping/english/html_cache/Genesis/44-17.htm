This moment is part of a larger narrative where Joseph tests his brothers' integrity and repentance. His position as a ruler contrasts with his earlier life when he was sold into slavery by these same brothers.<p><b>Far be it from me to do this.</b><br>Joseph's response indicates a sense of justice and righteousness. He distances himself from any wrongdoing, reflecting his character throughout the narrative. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of justice, seen in other scriptures like <a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>, where Abraham appeals to God's justice.<p><b>The man who was found with the cup</b><br>The cup refers to the silver cup planted in Benjamin's sack, a test orchestrated by Joseph. This incident is pivotal, as it brings to light the brothers' past actions and their current character. The cup symbolizes Joseph's authority and the divine insight attributed to him, reminiscent of the cupbearer's dream interpretation in <a href="/genesis/40.htm">Genesis 40</a>.<p><b>will be my slave.</b><br>This statement is a test of the brothers' loyalty and repentance. Slavery in ancient Egypt was a common practice, and Joseph's own experience as a slave adds depth to this pronouncement. The concept of slavery here also foreshadows the Israelites' future bondage in Egypt.<p><b>The rest of you may return to your father in peace.</b><br>Joseph offers the brothers a choice, testing their unity and concern for Benjamin.

After years of silence, his direct speech underscores the seriousness of the moment (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9</a>; 44:14&#8211;15). He stands as an authority figure who will render judgment, yet he is also their brother whose hidden identity drives the unfolding test.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Far be it from me to do this</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s first words signal moral clarity. He refuses any option that would compromise justice.<p>&#8226; He distances himself from collective punishment, echoing the principle that &#8220;the judges&#8230;shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-1.htm">Deuteronomy 25:1</a>).<p>&#8226; His statement mirrors <a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>&#8212;acquitting the guilty or condemning the innocent are both detestable.

Will he now fulfill that vow?<p>&#8226; The brothers can walk away guilt-free&#8212;externally. Yet returning without Benjamin would shatter Jacob, recalling the decades-long grief over Joseph.<p>&#8226; The offer points to God&#8217;s mercy: judgment on the guilty, peace offered to the repentant (<a href="/psalms/85-8.htm">Psalm 85:8</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). Joseph longs for reconciliation but waits for evidence of transformed hearts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-17.htm">Genesis 44:17</a> showcases Joseph&#8217;s righteous discernment and strategic mercy. By isolating Benjamin for punishment while releasing the others, he recreates the circumstances of his own betrayal to test whether his brothers have truly changed. The verse affirms personal responsibility, the necessity of justice, and the possibility of peace. Ultimately, it frames the gospel pattern: guilt exposed, a substitute sought, and reconciliation offered to all who choose sacrificial love over self-preservation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Joseph replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
