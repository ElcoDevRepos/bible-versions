The setting sun can also signify the end of a day, metaphorically representing the end of an era or the beginning of a new covenant, as seen in the context of God's promises to Abram.<p><b>Abram fell into a deep sleep</b><br>The deep sleep Abram experiences is reminiscent of the deep sleep God caused to fall upon Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>. This sleep is not ordinary but divinely induced, suggesting a state where God can communicate profound truths or revelations. It signifies a moment of divine intervention where God is about to reveal His covenant and future plans to Abram.<p><b>and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him</b><br>The terror and darkness that Abram experiences symbolize the gravity and seriousness of the revelation he is about to receive. Darkness often represents the unknown or the presence of God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>, where Moses approaches the thick darkness where God was. The terror could foreshadow the future suffering of Abram's descendants, as God reveals the prophecy of their enslavement in Egypt.
