In biblical context, councils were gatherings where decisions were made, often by elders or leaders. The speaker, Jacob, distances himself from their violent and impulsive behavior, indicating a moral and spiritual separation. This can be seen as a call to avoid ungodly influences, aligning with <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which advises against walking in the counsel of the wicked.<p><b>may I never join their assembly.</b><br>Assemblies in ancient Israel were significant gatherings for communal decision-making and worship. By refusing to join their assembly, Jacob emphasizes the severity of Simeon and Levi's actions. This separation underscores the importance of maintaining purity and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-17</a>, which speaks about not being unequally yoked with unbelievers. The assembly here is not just a physical gathering but represents shared values and actions.<p><b>For they kill men in their anger,</b><br>This phrase highlights the violent nature of Simeon and Levi, referencing their actions in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, where they avenged their sister Dinah by killing the men of Shechem. Anger leading to murder is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, where Jesus equates anger with murder in the heart. This serves as a warning against allowing emotions to lead to sin.<p><b>and hamstring oxen on a whim.</b><br>Hamstringing oxen was a cruel act that rendered the animals useless for work, reflecting wanton destruction and disregard for God's creation. This act symbolizes unnecessary violence and impulsive cruelty. In a broader sense, it represents the misuse of power and authority, contrasting with the stewardship and care expected of God's people, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which speaks of the righteous caring for the needs of their animals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel, who is giving his final blessings and prophecies concerning his sons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Two of Jacob's sons, whose actions are being condemned in this verse.

He refuses to step into their inner circle&#8212;where their plans are hatched&#8212;because partnership with unrepentant violence pollutes the one who partners. <a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> echoes the wisdom: &#8220;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked.&#8221; <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a> warns, &#8220;Do not set foot on the path of the wicked,&#8221; and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> reminds, &#8220;Bad company corrupts good character.&#8221; In every era, God&#8217;s people safeguard their walk by avoiding councils that mock God&#8217;s ways.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May I never join their assembly</b><p>&#8220;Assembly&#8221; carries covenant flavor; it is the place of belonging. Jacob distances himself so completely that he even rejects ceremonial solidarity with these sons&#8217; future tribes. The same principle surfaces later in <a href="/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4&#8211;5</a>, where David shuns the &#8220;assembly of evildoers,&#8221; and in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>, &#8220;Come out from among them and be separate.&#8221; Fellowship is not merely social; it shapes destiny. Jacob&#8217;s refusal anticipates God&#8217;s call for His redeemed to remain distinct.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they kill men in their anger</b><p>Jacob names the crime: premeditated slaughter at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25-26</a>). Their rage moved beyond justice into bloodlust. Scripture consistently exposes such anger as destructive: <a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a> says, &#8220;An angry man stirs up dissension,&#8221; and <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a> teaches that &#8220;man&#8217;s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.&#8221; Human life, created in God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), is sacred; shedding it in fury invites divine judgment (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and hamstring oxen on a whim</b><p>The brothers&#8217; violence extended to animals, slashing tendons so beasts could not work again&#8212;wanton cruelty that served no moral purpose. <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a> affirms, &#8220;The righteous care for the needs of their animals,&#8221; while <a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> commands mercy even in labor, &#8220;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.&#8221; Their reckless impulse shows a heart unbridled, ignoring God&#8217;s ownership of every creature (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a> reveals Jacob&#8217;s Spirit-led discernment: a godly man must refuse intimate alliance with persistent, unrepentant violence. Simeon and Levi&#8217;s unchecked anger defiled both human life and animal creation, proving they were unsafe partners in destiny. Scripture calls believers to separate from wicked schemes, cherish life, and embody mercy&#8212;walking in fellowship with God rather than with those who trample His image and handiwork.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Their secret.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">sod </span>used here is literally the little carpet, or cushion, upon which an Oriental sits.

It means here their union, or confederacy.

The ox was in old times the symbol of majesty, and thus <span class= "ital">bulls </span>are put for <span class= "ital">princes </span>in <a href="/psalms/22-12.htm" title="Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-30.htm" title="Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter you the people that delight in war.">Psalm 68:30</a>. Thus, then, the meaning is, "In their anger at the wrong done to their sister they slew Hamor, prince of Shechem, with his people; and from wanton cruelty, without any just cause for indignation, they hamstrung the noblest of their brethren, not killing Joseph outright, but disabling him by selling him into slavery, that he might there perish."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/49-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">May I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
