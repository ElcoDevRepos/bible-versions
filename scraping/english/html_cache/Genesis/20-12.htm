The term "sister" here is used in a broader sense, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where familial terms could denote various degrees of kinship. Abraham's claim is technically true, as Sarah is his half-sister. This reflects the complex family structures and marriage practices of the time, which were often different from modern norms. The use of "sister" also highlights the recurring theme of deception in Abraham's life, as seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a> when he similarly misled Pharaoh.<p><b>the daughter of my father&#8212;though not the daughter of my mother</b><br>This phrase clarifies the familial relationship between Abraham and Sarah, indicating that they share the same father, Terah, but have different mothers. Such marriages were not uncommon in ancient times and were later explicitly prohibited in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>). This detail underscores the patriarchal lineage and the importance of maintaining family ties within the clan, which was crucial for inheritance and social stability.<p><b>and she became my wife</b><br>Sarah's role as Abraham's wife is central to the Abrahamic covenant, as she is the mother of Isaac, the child of promise. This marriage is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants and the land. The union of Abraham and Sarah also prefigures the relationship between Christ and the Church, with Sarah representing the faithful who are part of God's covenant community. This typology is further explored in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where Paul uses Sarah and Hagar to illustrate the difference between the old and new covenants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is speaking in this verse.

The word &#8220;Besides&#8221; signals that he is now offering additional information&#8212;not an excuse, but the factual basis of his statement. By opening this way, Abraham is acknowledging that his earlier claim had an element of truth, even if it misled (compare <a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11-13 and 20</a>:2).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she really is my sister</b><p>&#8226; Abraham affirms a literal family bond; his assertion is not invented.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/11-29.htm">Genesis 11:29</a> notes that Abram married &#8220;Sarai,&#8221; already identified in the family record, so the relationship predates his call in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores how a half-truth can still misrepresent reality. Though Sarah was genuinely kin, withholding the marital fact endangered moral clarity (see also <a href="/genesis/20-5.htm">Genesis 20:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the daughter of my father</b><p>&#8226; Terah fathered both Abram and Sarai (<a href="/genesis/11-27.htm">Genesis 11:27</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a> locates Terah in a pagan context, highlighting God&#8217;s grace in calling this imperfect family.<p>&#8226; By pointing to their shared father, Abraham explains the technical accuracy of calling Sarah &#8220;sister.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though not the daughter of my mother</b><p>&#8226; The clause clarifies that Sarah was a half-sister, which, at that early stage of human history, was not yet prohibited (<a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9 and 20</a>:17 would later forbid it under Mosaic Law).<p>&#8226; The distinction removes any suggestion of full siblings marrying, emphasizing that God&#8217;s later regulations were progressive revelations rather than retroactive condemnations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she became my wife</b><p>&#8226; The verse concludes with the truth Abraham should have led with: Sarah was&#8212;and remained&#8212;his covenant wife (<a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s intervention in <a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3-7</a> shows His commitment to protect that marriage, keeping Abimelech from sinning (<a href="/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This closing phrase reminds readers that divine purpose rests on their union; through this couple God promised the coming Seed (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a> reveals that Abraham&#8217;s statement about Sarah contained factual accuracy&#8212;she was his half-sister&#8212;yet his selective disclosure misled others and put God&#8217;s promises at risk. The verse highlights:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness to protect His covenant vessels even when they act out of fear,<p>&#8226; the danger of half-truths that compromise witness, and<p>&#8226; the unfolding nature of divine law, allowing for earlier practices later ruled out under Moses.
