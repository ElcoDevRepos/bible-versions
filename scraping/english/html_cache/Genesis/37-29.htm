This reflects Reuben's attempt to assert his leadership and responsibility as the firstborn, despite his previous failings, such as his indiscretion with Bilhah (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>). The pit, likely a cistern, was a common feature in the arid regions of Canaan, used to collect rainwater. This setting underscores the desolation and danger Joseph faced, symbolizing the depths of betrayal by his brothers.<p><b>and saw that Joseph was not there,</b><br>Reuben's discovery that Joseph was missing indicates a significant turning point in the narrative. His absence from the pit foreshadows the unfolding of God's providential plan, despite human intentions. This moment connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty, as seen in Joseph's eventual rise to power in Egypt, which was part of God's plan to preserve the Israelites during famine (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). The absence also highlights the brothers' deceit and the beginning of their guilt and fear, which will later be confronted when they meet Joseph in Egypt.<p><b>he tore his clothes,</b><br>Tearing one's clothes was a traditional expression of grief, distress, or repentance in ancient Near Eastern cultures, including among the Israelites. This act signifies Reuben's deep anguish and despair over the loss of Joseph, whom he had hoped to save. It also reflects the cultural practices of mourning, seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as when Jacob mourns Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>) and when Job laments his suffering (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>).

Even in a moment of failure, the Lord is steering events toward preservation and redemption, reminding us that no setback can thwart His purposes (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Reuben</span> <span class= "bld">returned.</span>--Evidently he was not present when Joseph was sold to the Midianites. This has been made into a difficulty, but really it confirms the truth of the narrative. For the difficulty arises solely from the supposition that Joseph's brethren immediately after casting him into the pit "sat down to eat bread," an act well described as most cold-blooded. But they were not actually guilty of it; for what the narrative says is that they were having their evening meal when the caravan came in sight. Reuben, between the casting of Joseph into the pit and the evening meal, had apparently gone a long round to fetch in the more distant cattle, and probably had remained away as long as possible, in order to feel sure that his brethren would on his return be at their dinner. He hoped thus to be able to go alone to the cistern, and rescue Joseph, and send him away home before the rest could interfere. Thus rightly understood, it is a proof of the trustworthiness of the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Reuben</span> (in whose absence apparently the scheme of sale had been concocted and carried through) <span class="cmt_word">returned to the pit</span> (obviously with a view to deliver Joseph); <span class="cmt_word">and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes</span> - a token of his mingled grief and horror at the discovery (cf. ver. 34; 44:13; <a href="/2_samuel/13-31.htm">2 Samuel 13:31</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child</span> (or young man, as in <a href="/genesis/4-23.htm">Genesis 4:23</a>, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> in the one hemistich is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> in the other) is not; <span class="cmt_word">and I, whither shall I go</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> however shall I account for his disappearance?
