The boy, Ishmael, is Abraham's son through Hagar, and his cries in the wilderness reflect a dire situation. This moment underscores God's promise to Abraham that Ishmael would also become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>). It parallels God's hearing of the Israelites' cries in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>), showing His consistent nature in responding to the afflicted.<p><b>and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven</b><br>The angel of God represents a divine messenger, often seen as a theophany or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This encounter is significant as it shows God's direct intervention and guidance. Hagar's previous encounter with the angel of the Lord in <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a> established a pattern of divine care and promise for her and Ishmael. The heavenly origin of the call emphasizes the divine authority and assurance behind the message.<p><b>&#8220;What is wrong, Hagar?</b><br>This question is not for information but to engage Hagar, drawing her into a conversation that reassures and redirects her focus from despair to hope. It mirrors God's approach in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>, where He asks Adam, "Where are you?" inviting reflection and response. The personal address by name signifies God's intimate knowledge and care for individuals.<p><b>Do not be afraid</b><br>A common biblical exhortation, this phrase reassures Hagar of God's protection and provision. It echoes similar assurances given to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) and later to Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), indicating a consistent divine message of peace and encouragement in times of fear and uncertainty.<p><b>for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies</b><br>Reiterating God's attentiveness, this phrase confirms His awareness of Ishmael's plight. The specific mention of "where he lies" highlights God's omnipresence and ability to intervene regardless of physical location. It also fulfills the promise made to Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16-11.htm">Genesis 16:11</a>, where the name Ishmael, meaning "God hears," was given, thus reinforcing the theme of divine faithfulness and the power of prayer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The omniscient and compassionate deity who hears the cries of the afflicted and intervenes in their distress.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_god.htm">The Angel of God</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's message and assurance to Hagar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>The Egyptian maidservant of Sarah and mother of Ishmael, who finds herself in a desperate situation in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Hagar, whose cries are heard by God, leading to divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_of_beersheba.htm">The Wilderness of Beersheba</a></b><br>The desolate location where Hagar and Ishmael find themselves, symbolizing isolation and despair.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_compassion.htm">God's Omniscience and Compassion</a></b><br>God is aware of our struggles and hears our cries, even when we feel isolated and abandoned.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_intervention.htm">Divine Intervention</a></b><br>God's intervention often comes in unexpected ways and times, reminding us to trust in His timing and methods.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_faith.htm">Fear and Faith</a></b><br>The command "Do not be afraid" is a call to trust in God's provision and care, even in dire circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_every_life.htm">The Value of Every Life</a></b><br>God's response to Ishmael's cries underscores the value He places on every individual, regardless of their status or circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_desolation.htm">Hope in Desolation</a></b><br>Even in the wilderness of life, God provides hope and a future, encouraging us to look beyond our immediate circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_21_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 21:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_21_17_God_s_response_to_distress.htm">How does Genesis 21:17 demonstrate God's responsiveness to human distress and prayer?
