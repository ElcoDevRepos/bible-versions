In the context of <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, Jacob's sons had deceitfully proposed that the men of Shechem undergo circumcision as a condition for intermarriage. The acceptance of this offer highlights the cultural and economic motivations of Hamor and Shechem, who saw the potential for increased wealth and alliances through intermarriage with Jacob's family. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of forming alliances through marriage.<p><b>to Hamor and his son Shechem:</b><br>Hamor was the Hivite ruler of the city of Shechem, and his son Shechem was the prince who had defiled Dinah, Jacob's daughter. The mention of both father and son underscores the familial and political dynamics at play. Shechem's desire to marry Dinah, despite his previous actions, suggests a complex interplay of personal desire and political strategy. The city of Shechem, located in the region of Canaan, was a significant urban center in biblical times, often associated with key events in Israel's history, such as the covenant renewal under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-25</a>). The willingness of Hamor and Shechem to accept the terms proposed by Jacob's sons also foreshadows the tragic outcome of the narrative, where the deceit leads to violence and retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince.

By receiving an &#8220;offer,&#8221; Hamor and Shechem believe they are participants, not targets, in the negotiation&#8212;echoing the deceptive truce in <a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3-15</a> where Gibeon also accepts terms without perceiving hidden motives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Seemed good</b><p>&#8226;
