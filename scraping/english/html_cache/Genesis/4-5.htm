The context reveals that Cain brought "some of the fruits of the soil" as an offering, while Abel brought "fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock." The difference in offerings suggests a difference in heart attitude and faith. <a href="/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a> highlights Abel's offering as being made by faith, implying Cain's lack of faith or sincerity. The absence of regard from God suggests that the offering was not made with the right heart or intention, aligning with <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, which emphasizes that God looks at the heart. This rejection foreshadows the importance of heart posture in worship and sacrifice, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>So Cain became very angry,</b><br>Cain's anger reflects a deeper issue of pride and jealousy. His reaction to God's rejection reveals his unwillingness to self-reflect or repent. This anger can be seen as a precursor to sin, as God warns Cain in the following verses about sin crouching at his door. The anger also highlights the human tendency to react negatively when confronted with personal shortcomings or divine correction. This mirrors the human condition post-Fall, where sin distorts relationships with God and others.<p><b>and his countenance fell.</b><br>The phrase "his countenance fell" indicates a visible change in Cain's demeanor, reflecting his inner turmoil and disappointment. This change in expression is not just emotional but spiritual, as it signifies a turning away from God. The fallen countenance can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual decline, a theme echoed in other biblical narratives where individuals turn away from God. This moment sets the stage for Cain's subsequent actions, illustrating how unchecked emotions can lead to sin. It serves as a warning about the importance of addressing inner attitudes before they manifest in destructive behavior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, a farmer who brought an offering to the Lord from the fruits of the soil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abel.htm">Abel</a></b><br>Cain's brother, a shepherd who brought an offering from the firstborn of his flock.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_offering.htm">The Offering</a></b><br>Cain's offering was from the fruits of the soil, while Abel's was from the firstborn of his flock.

Cain brought something, yet withheld himself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a> warns, &#8220;Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, while his brother&#8217;s were righteous.&#8221; Cain&#8217;s deeds were evil long before his hands were.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Cain became very angry,</b><p>&#8226; Anger surfaces when pride is wounded. Instead of examining his own heart, Cain lashed out at God&#8217;s verdict, similar to <a href="/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a> where &#8220;it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a> reminds us that &#8220;man&#8217;s anger does not bring about the righteousness that God desires.&#8221; Cain&#8217;s fury revealed a refusal to humble himself.<p>&#8226; God immediately pursued Cain with counsel (<a href="/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6-7</a>), proving divine grace reaches out even while we stew in sin.<p>&#8226; Unchecked anger quickly turns destructive (<a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26-27</a>). Cain&#8217;s story shows how resentment, if nurtured, matures into violence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his countenance fell.</b><p>&#8226; Sin never stays hidden; it shows on the face. When Hannah was assured by Eli, &#8220;her face was no longer downcast&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/1-18.htm">1 Samuel 1:18</a>). Cain&#8217;s fallen face shows the opposite&#8212;guilt without repentance.<p>&#8226; A downcast look signals a soul bearing its own burden instead of casting it on the Lord (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord queried, &#8220;Why has your countenance fallen?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-6.htm">Genesis 4:6</a>). This question invited confession, yet Cain clung to self-pity.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/27-19.htm">Proverbs 27:19</a> notes, &#8220;As water reflects the face, so a man&#8217;s heart reflects the man.&#8221; Cain&#8217;s fallen face mirrored a heart set on rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5</a> reveals more than God&#8217;s disapproval of a sacrifice; it exposes a heart problem. Abel approached in faith and obedience; Cain offered ritual without repentance. God&#8217;s rejection was just, Cain&#8217;s anger was self-centered, and his fallen face announced inward revolt. The verse warns us to bring God our hearts, not mere tokens, and to respond to His correction with humility rather than hostility.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Cain was very wroth.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">it burned to Cain exceedingly: </span>that is, his heart was full of hot indignant feelings, because of the preference shown to his younger brother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect</span>. Because of the absence of those qualities which distinguished Abel and his offering; not because the heart of Cain was "no more pure," but "imbued with a criminal propensity" (Kalisch), which it was not until his offering was rejected. The visible sign, whatever it was, being awanting in the case of Cain's oblation, its absence left the offerer in no dubiety as to the Divine displeasure with both himself and his offering. In the rejection of Cain's offering Bohlen sees the animus of a Levitical narrator, who looks down slightingly on offerings of the fruits and flowers of earth; but, as Havernick well remarks, the theocracy was essentially based on agriculture, while the Mosaic institute distinctly recognized the legality and value of bloodless offerings. <span class="cmt_word">And Cain was very wroth</span> (literally, <span class="accented">it</span> <span class="accented">burned with Cain exceedingly</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and his countenance fell</span>. In fierce resentment against his brother, possibly in disappointed rage against himself, almost certainly in anger against God (cf. <a href="/nehemiah/6-16.htm">Nehemiah 6:16</a>; <a href="/job/29-24.htm">Job 29:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, and contrast <a href="/job/11-15.htm">Job 11:15</a>). There was apparently no sorrow for sin, "no spirit of inquiry, self-examination, prayer to God for light or pardon, clearly showing that Cain was far from a right state of mind" (Murphy). Yet the Lord does not forthwith abandon the contumacious and insensate transgressor, but patiently expostulates with and instructs him as to how he too might obtain the same blessing of acceptance which his younger brother enjoyed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
