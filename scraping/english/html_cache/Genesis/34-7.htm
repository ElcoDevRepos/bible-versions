This setting underscores the agrarian lifestyle of the patriarchs. The urgency of their return suggests the gravity of the situation. The field represents their daily life, which is interrupted by the news of Dinah's defilement, highlighting the disruption of peace and normalcy.<p><b>They were filled with grief and fury,</b><br>The emotional response of Jacob's sons reflects the deep sense of injustice and violation of family honor. Grief and fury are common reactions to sin and injustice throughout Scripture, as seen in the righteous anger of God against sin (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>). This dual response also foreshadows the actions they will take, driven by both sorrow and anger.<p><b>because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel</b><br>The term "outrage" indicates a severe violation of moral and social norms. The use of "in Israel" is significant, as it reflects the nascent identity of Jacob's family as a distinct people, even before the formal establishment of the nation of Israel. This phrase emphasizes the communal impact of Shechem's act, not just a personal affront to Dinah.<p><b>by lying with Jacob&#8217;s daughter&#8212;</b><br>The act of lying with Dinah without consent is a grave sin, violating the sanctity of sexual relations as ordained by God. This incident highlights the vulnerability of women in ancient societies and the importance of family honor. It also serves as a reminder of the protective role of family and community in safeguarding individuals.<p><b>a thing that should not be done.</b><br>This phrase underscores the moral and ethical standards expected within the community. It reflects the universal understanding of certain actions as inherently wrong, aligning with the biblical principle of justice and righteousness.

In selecting them, and weaving them together into one history, he would add whatever was necessary, and in the latter half of this verse we apparently have one such addition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the sons of Jacob</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Leah's children, Dinah's full brothers, for certain, though perhaps also her half brothers) <span class="cmt_word">came out of the field when they heard it</span> (Jacob having probably sent them word): <span class="cmt_word">and the men were grieved</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">grieved themselves</span>, or became pained with anger, the verb being the hithpael of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to toil or labor with pain. The LXX. connect this with the preceding clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, implying that they did not learn of their sister's seduction till they came home - <span class="cmt_word">and they were very wroth,</span> - literally, it <span class="accented">burned to them greatly</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/31-36.htm">Genesis 31:36</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-11.htm">1 Samuel 15:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-4.htm">2 Samuel 19:4</a>:3). Michaelis mentions an opinion still entertained in the East which explains the excessive indignation kindled in the breasts of Dinah's brothers, vie., that "in those countries it is thought that a brother is more dishonored by the seduction of his sister than a man by the infidelity of his wife; for, say the Arabs, a man may divorce his wife, and then she is no longer his; while a sister and daughter remain always sister and daughter" (vide Kurtz, 'Hist. of Old Covenant,' (82) - <span class="cmt_word">because he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shechem) - <span class="cmt_word">had wrought folly</span>. - the term <span class="accented">folly</span> easily passes into the idea of wickedness of a shameful character (<a href="/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-12.htm">2 Samuel 13:12</a>), since from the standpoint of Scripture sin is the height of unreason (<a href="/psalms/74-22.htm">Psalm 74:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>), and holiness the sublimest act of wisdom (<a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) - in (or against) <span class="cmt_word">Israel</span> - the word, here applied for the first time to Jacob's household, afterwards became the usual national designation of Jacob's descendants; and the phrase here employed for the first time afterwards passed into a standing expression for acts done against the sacred character which belonged to Israel as a separated and covenanted community, especially for sins of the flesh (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>; <a href="/judges/20-10.htm">Judges 20:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>), but also for other crimes (<a href="/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">in lying with Jacob's daughter</span>. The special wickedness of Shechem consisted in dishonoring a daughter of one who was the head of the theocratic line, and therefore under peculiar obligations to lead s holy life. <span class="cmt_word">Which thing ought not to be done</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and so is it not done</span> (cf. <a href="/genesis/29-26.htm">Genesis 29:26</a>). Assigned to the historian ('Speaker's Commentary'), or to the hand of a late redactor (Davidson, Colenso, Alford), there is no reason why these words should not have been spoken by Jacob's sons (Keil, Murphy, and others)' to indicate their sense of the new and higher morality that had come in with the name of Israel (Lange). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Jacob&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
