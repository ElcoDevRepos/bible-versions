The use of "garments of skin" suggests the first instance of animal sacrifice, symbolizing the seriousness of sin and the necessity of atonement. This act foreshadows the sacrificial system later established in the Mosaic Law and ultimately points to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the "Lamb of God" (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), who provides the ultimate covering for sin. The act of making garments also demonstrates God's continued care and mercy, even in judgment.<p><b>for Adam and his wife</b><br>The specific mention of "Adam and his wife" underscores the personal nature of God's provision. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and humanity, despite the breach caused by sin. This provision for both Adam and Eve indicates the equal need for redemption and covering for both genders, aligning with the biblical theme of equality in spiritual need and provision (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>and He clothed them</b><br>Clothing Adam and Eve signifies a transition from innocence to awareness of sin, as they had previously been naked and unashamed (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>). This act of clothing is symbolic of God's grace, covering their shame and guilt. It prefigures the righteousness of Christ that believers are clothed with through faith (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). The act of God clothing them also contrasts with their earlier attempt to cover themselves with fig leaves (<a href="/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>), highlighting the insufficiency of human efforts to deal with sin compared to God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of all things, who acts with authority and compassion in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam.htm">Adam</a></b><br>The first man created by God, who, along with his wife, disobeyed God's command, resulting in the Fall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eve.htm">Eve</a></b><br>The first woman, created from Adam, who also partook in the disobedience against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_garden_of_eden.htm">The Garden of Eden</a></b><br>The initial dwelling place of Adam and Eve, representing a place of perfect fellowship with God before the Fall.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_making_of_garments.htm">The Making of Garments</a></b><br>An act of God providing for Adam and Eve's physical needs and symbolizing a deeper spiritual truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_grace.htm">God's Provision and Grace</a></b><br>Despite Adam and Eve's disobedience, God provides for their needs, demonstrating His grace and mercy even in judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_sin.htm">The Cost of Sin</a></b><br>The making of garments from animal skins implies the first physical death, illustrating that sin results in death and foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covering_of_shame.htm">Covering of Shame</a></b><br>God's act of clothing Adam and Eve signifies the covering of their shame, pointing to the spiritual covering provided through Christ's righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_necessity_of_atonement.htm">The Necessity of Atonement</a></b><br>The shedding of blood for the garments prefigures the necessity of atonement for sin, fulfilled in Jesus' sacrifice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_of_relationship.htm">Restoration of Relationship</a></b><br>God's continued interaction with Adam and Eve, even after their sin, shows His desire to restore broken relationships.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_3_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 3:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_3_21_God_s_provision_post-sin.htm">How does Genesis 3:21 demonstrate God's provision despite Adam and Eve's disobedience?

Until sin entered the world no sacrifices could have been offered; and if, therefore, these were the skins of animals offered in sacrifice, as many suppose, Adam must in some way, immediately after the fall, have been taught that without shedding of blood is no remission of sin, but that God will accept a vicarious sacrifice. This is perhaps the most tenable view; and if, with Knobel, we see in this arrival at the idea of sacrifice a rapid development in Adam of thought and intellect, yet it may not have been entirely spontaneous, but the effect of divinely-inspired convictions rising up within his soul. It shows also that the innocence of our first parents was gone. In his happy state Adam had studied the animals, and tamed them and made them his friends; now a sense of guilt urges him to inflict upon them pain and suffering and death. But in the first sacrifice was laid the foundation of the whole Mosaical dispensation, as in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a> that of the Gospel. Moreover, from sacrificial worship there was alleviation for man's bodily wants, and he went forth equipped with raiment suited for the harder lot that awaited him outside the garden; and, better far, there was peace for his soul, and the thought--even if still but faint and dim--of the possibility for him of an atonement.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats</span> (<span class="accented">cathnoth</span>, from <span class="accented">cathan</span>, to cover; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>; Sanscrit, <span class="accented">katam</span>; English, <span class="accented">cotton</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of skin</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, the skin of a man, from <span class="accented">ur</span>, to be naked, hence a hide).
