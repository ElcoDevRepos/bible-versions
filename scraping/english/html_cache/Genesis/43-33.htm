Joseph's ability to seat his brothers according to their birth order would have been surprising, as they had not disclosed this information. This act demonstrates Joseph's knowledge and authority, hinting at his true identity. It also reflects the divine wisdom given to Joseph, reminiscent of God's omniscience. The order by age underscores the importance of birthright and lineage in biblical narratives, as seen in the stories of Esau and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>).<p><b>from the firstborn to the youngest</b><br>The emphasis on birth order highlights the cultural significance of the firstborn's rights and responsibilities, which included leadership and a double portion of inheritance (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). This arrangement foreshadows the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the fulfillment of his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where his brothers would bow to him. The mention of the youngest, Benjamin, is significant as he is Joseph's full brother, and his presence is crucial for the unfolding of Joseph's plan to test his brothers' integrity and repentance.<p><b>and the men looked at one another in astonishment</b><br>The brothers' astonishment reveals their lack of understanding of the situation and their ignorance of Joseph's identity. This moment of surprise is a turning point, as it begins to unravel the mystery surrounding the Egyptian ruler's actions. Their reaction can be seen as a moment of divine intervention, where God orchestrates events to bring about reconciliation and fulfillment of His promises. This astonishment also parallels the disciples' reactions to Jesus' actions and teachings, which often left them in awe and wonder (<a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is actually the brother of the men seated before him.
