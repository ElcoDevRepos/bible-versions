This phrase sets the stage for a confrontation between Laban and Jacob, highlighting the tension and unresolved issues between them. Laban's authority as the head of the family and his role in Jacob's life as his father-in-law are central to this encounter. The patriarchal culture of the time gave Laban significant control over his daughters and their offspring, which he asserts in his response.<p><b>&#8220;These daughters are my daughters,</b><br>Laban's claim over his daughters reflects the cultural norms of the ancient Near East, where daughters were often considered the property of their fathers until marriage. Even after marriage, familial ties remained strong, and Laban's statement underscores his continued sense of ownership and responsibility. This also highlights the importance of family lineage and inheritance in biblical times.<p><b>these sons are my sons,</b><br>Laban refers to his grandchildren as his own sons, emphasizing the patriarchal structure where the grandfather had a significant role in the family hierarchy. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational blessings and responsibilities, as seen in other patriarchal narratives such as those of Abraham and Isaac.<p><b>and these flocks are my flocks!</b><br>Laban's claim over the flocks points to the wealth and prosperity that Jacob had accumulated while working for him. In the ancient world, livestock was a primary measure of wealth, and Laban's assertion indicates his belief that Jacob's prosperity was due to his own resources and blessing. This echoes earlier tensions over the division of flocks and the divine favor that Jacob experienced.<p><b>Everything you see is mine!</b><br>Laban's sweeping claim of ownership over all that Jacob has acquired reflects his possessive nature and the conflict over material wealth. This statement can be seen as an expression of Laban's unwillingness to acknowledge Jacob's independent success and God's blessing upon him. It also highlights the broader biblical theme of God's provision and the tension between human claims and divine sovereignty.<p><b>Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine or the children they have borne?</b><br>Laban's rhetorical question reveals his recognition of the limits of his power. Despite his claims, he acknowledges that he cannot change the current situation. This moment of resignation can be seen as a turning point, where Laban must accept the new family dynamics. It also reflects the biblical theme of God's ultimate control over human affairs, as seen in the resolution of conflicts throughout the patriarchal narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the father-in-law of Jacob, a man known for his cunning and manipulative behavior.

Jacob has fled with his family and possessions; Laban has overtaken him, feeling cheated. The phrase shows Laban taking the initiative, but also reacting to God&#8217;s warning the night before: &#8220;Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>).

Why should he wish to injure Jacob, and send him away empty? All that he had was still Laban's in the best of senses; for were not Rachel and Leah his daughters? And were not their children his grandsons? How was it possible that he could wish to rob them? He proposes, therefore, that they should make a covenant, by which Jacob should bind himself to deal kindly with his daughters, and to take no other wife; while he promises for himself that he would do Jacob no wrong. Jacob therefore sets up a large stone, as a pillar and memorial; and Laban subsequently does the same; while, probably between the two hills on which they had severally encamped (<a href="/genesis/31-25.htm" title="Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brothers pitched in the mount of Gilead.">Genesis 31:25</a>), they collect a large mass of other stones, on which they feast together, in token of friendship (<a href="/genesis/26-30.htm" title="And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.">Genesis 26:30</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43, 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban answered and said unto Jacob</span>, - neither receiving Jacob's torrent of invective with affected meekness (Candlish), nor proving himself to be completely reformed by the angry recriminations of his "callous and hardened son-in-law (Kalisch); but perhaps simply owning the truth of Jacob's wants, and recognizing that he had no just ground of complaint (Calvin), as well as touched in his paternal affections by the sight of his daughters, from whom he felt that he was about to part for ever. <span class="cmt_word">These daughters</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the daughters</span> (there) - <span class="cmt_word">are my daughters, and these</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">children are my children, and these</span> (literally, the) <span class="cmt_word">cattle are my cattle; and all that thou seest is mine</span>.
