This encounter follows their reconciliation after years of estrangement due to Jacob's earlier deception. Jacob's reply is respectful, addressing Esau as "my lord," which indicates humility and a desire to maintain peace. This approach is consistent with Jacob's character, who often uses strategic thinking to navigate complex situations, as seen throughout his life.<p><b>My lord knows that the children are frail</b><br>Jacob emphasizes the vulnerability of his children, highlighting the importance of family care and protection. This reflects the patriarchal responsibility in ancient Near Eastern culture, where the well-being of one's family was paramount. The mention of frail children also underscores the human aspect of the biblical narrative, reminding readers of the tangible challenges faced by the patriarchs.<p><b>and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young</b><br>Jacob's mention of livestock care points to his role as a shepherd, a common occupation in biblical times. This responsibility required attentiveness and patience, as the well-being of the animals was crucial for survival and prosperity. The reference to nursing animals indicates a period of vulnerability, necessitating careful management. This imagery of a shepherd caring for his flock is later echoed in the depiction of Jesus as the Good Shepherd in the New Testament.<p><b>If they are driven hard for even a day</b><br>Jacob's concern about driving the animals too hard reflects an understanding of the limitations and needs of his livestock. This statement reveals a compassionate and wise stewardship, recognizing that overexertion could lead to harm. The principle of rest and care for animals is later codified in the Mosaic Law, which includes provisions for the Sabbath rest for both people and animals.<p><b>all the animals will die</b><br>Jacob's warning about the potential death of the animals underscores the seriousness of his concern. This phrase highlights the fragile balance of life in the ancient world, where the loss of livestock could have devastating economic and social consequences. It also serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of creation, where the well-being of one part affects the whole. This theme of stewardship and care for creation is a recurring biblical motif, emphasizing humanity's role in nurturing and preserving God's creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to Canaan after years in Haran.
