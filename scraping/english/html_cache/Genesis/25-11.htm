Abraham is a central figure in the biblical story, known for his faith and obedience to God. His death signifies a transition in leadership and the continuation of God's covenant through his descendants. Abraham's passing is recorded in <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>, where he is described as dying at a good old age, full of years, and being gathered to his people, indicating a peaceful and honorable death.<p><b>God blessed his son Isaac</b><br>The blessing of Isaac by God is a continuation of the Abrahamic covenant. This covenant, first established in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>, includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing. Isaac, as the child of promise, inherits these blessings, ensuring the continuation of God's plan through Abraham's lineage. This blessing is significant as it reaffirms God's faithfulness and the chosen status of Isaac, distinguishing him from Abraham's other sons, such as Ishmael.<p><b>who lived near Beer-lahai-roi</b><br>Beer-lahai-roi is a well located in the Negev desert, first mentioned in <a href="/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>. It is the place where Hagar, Sarah's maidservant, encountered the Angel of the Lord after fleeing from Sarah. The name Beer-lahai-roi means "Well of the Living One who sees me," highlighting God's providence and care. Isaac's residence near this well suggests a connection to God's past interventions and a place of divine encounter. This location is also geographically significant, as it situates Isaac in the southern part of Canaan, aligning with the broader narrative of the patriarchs' movements within the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, whose faith and obedience to God set a foundational example for his descendants.
