Rebekah favored Jacob over Esau, as seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>. This favoritism sets the stage for the deception that follows. The family dynamics here are complex, with Rebekah orchestrating a plan to secure the blessing for Jacob, which was culturally significant as the blessing was typically given to the firstborn son. This moment also reflects the fulfillment of God's prophecy to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where it was foretold that the older would serve the younger.<p><b>&#8220;Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man</b><br>Esau's description as "hairy" is consistent with his name, which is related to the Hebrew word for "hairy" or "rough." This physical characteristic is significant in the narrative, as it becomes a key element in the deception of Isaac. The distinction between Esau and Jacob is not only physical but also symbolic of their differing roles and destinies. Esau's hairiness is mentioned earlier in <a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a> at his birth, emphasizing the contrast between the two brothers.<p><b>but I am smooth-skinned.</b><br>Jacob's smooth skin contrasts sharply with Esau's hairiness, underscoring the challenge in deceiving their father, Isaac. This physical difference is crucial to the plot, as Rebekah devises a plan to cover Jacob's hands and neck with goat skins to mimic Esau's texture. The smoothness of Jacob's skin can also be seen as symbolic of his character and the cunning nature he exhibits throughout his life. This moment foreshadows the lengths to which Jacob will go to achieve his goals, a theme that continues throughout his story, including his later wrestling with God in <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is known for his cunning and strategic thinking.

He is not questioning the prophecy that &#8220;the older will serve the younger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) but the practical problem of carrying out the plan. His response shows:<p>&#8226; A son who respects his mother&#8217;s leadership yet feels the weight of personal responsibility (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>).<p>&#8226; A real-time moral tension: Rebekah&#8217;s scheme versus God&#8217;s promise. Scripture presents the incident exactly as it happened, letting us see both human failure and divine sovereignty at work (<a href="/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look</b><p>&#8220;Look&#8221; signals Jacob&#8217;s careful nature. Before acting, he pauses to point out a glaring obstacle in Rebekah&#8217;s proposal. That single word captures:<p>&#8226; An honest concern, not defiance&#8212;he is weighing consequences (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; A moment of hesitation that underlines how close the plan is to failing before it begins (<a href="/genesis/27-12.htm">Genesis 27:12</a>).<p>&#8226; A reminder that when Scripture says &#8220;Look,&#8221; it invites us to slow down and observe (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My brother Esau is a hairy man</b><p>Jacob states the obvious but critical fact: Esau&#8217;s body hair. Earlier the Bible already noted Esau was &#8220;like a hairy garment&#8221; at birth (<a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>), and Isaac later relies on touch to confirm identity (<a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22-23</a>). From this we learn:<p>&#8226; God allowed Esau&#8217;s distinctive appearance to become the very trait that must be imitated.<p>&#8226; Physical characteristics in Scripture often foreshadow future events&#8212;here, Esau&#8217;s hair signals both his identity and the means by which the blessing is contested.<p>&#8226; The detail underscores the narrative&#8217;s historicity; such specifics are unnecessary for moralism alone but vital for accurate history.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But I am smooth-skinned</b><p>Jacob contrasts himself with Esau, recognizing the danger of exposure. His fear is voiced in the next verse: &#8220;Perhaps my father will feel me, and I will be seen as a deceiver&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-12.htm">Genesis 27:12</a>). Notice:<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s smooth skin represents more than texture; it embodies vulnerability and the risk of a curse (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-18.htm">Deuteronomy 27:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Rebekah&#8217;s swift solution&#8212;wrapping his hands and neck with goat skins (<a href="/genesis/27-16.htm">Genesis 27:16</a>)&#8212;highlights her determination and ingenuity.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s overarching purpose moves forward even through human schemes (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-11.htm">Genesis 27:11</a> captures Jacob&#8217;s initial objection to Rebekah&#8217;s plan by spotlighting the tangible difference between the two brothers. His respectful caution (&#8220;Look&#8221;) and clear-eyed assessment of Esau&#8217;s hair versus his own smooth skin reveal a young man caught between honoring his mother, fearing his father&#8217;s curse, and trusting God&#8217;s earlier promise. The verse therefore sets the stage for the dramatic deception that follows while reminding us that Scripture&#8217;s smallest physical details serve God&#8217;s larger, literal plan to fulfill His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (who was not yet such an adept at trickery as he afterwards became, and who, if he had no scruples of conscience in either imposing on a senile parent or despoiling an open-hearted brother, was yet averse to being detected in his frauds, as deceivers usually are) <span class="cmt_word">said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>) <span class="cmt_word">and I am a smooth</span> <span class="cmt_word">man</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span>, smooth (opposed to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>," hairy); the primary idea of which is to cut off the hair. <span class="accented">Cf</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">glacies</span>, <span class="accented">glaber</span>, <span class="accented">gladius</span>, <span class="accented">glisco</span>; gluten, glatt, gleiten, glas - all of which convey the notion of smoothness (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, p. 283). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">answered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Rebekah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ri&#7687;&#183;q&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7259.htm">Strong's 7259: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rebekah -- wife of Isaac</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Look,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
