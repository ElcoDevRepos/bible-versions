In the context of Genesis, it indicates a specific time frame that allowed Jacob to gain a head start in his departure from Laban. The number three frequently appears in Scripture, such as in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day, highlighting themes of deliverance and new beginnings.<p><b>Laban was informed</b><br>Laban's delayed awareness of Jacob's departure suggests a lack of immediate communication, typical of the ancient Near Eastern context. This delay allowed Jacob to put significant distance between himself and Laban. The phrase also underscores the tension and lack of trust between Laban and Jacob, a recurring theme in their relationship. Laban's eventual pursuit reflects his desire to maintain control over his household and possessions.<p><b>that Jacob had fled</b><br>Jacob's flight was a strategic move to escape Laban's oppressive control and to return to the land promised to his forefathers. This act of fleeing can be seen as a fulfillment of God's command to Jacob to return to his homeland. It also echoes earlier biblical narratives of escape and deliverance, such as the Exodus, where God's people are led out of bondage. Jacob's departure is a pivotal moment in his journey, marking a transition from servitude to the fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's mother, and the father of Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives.
