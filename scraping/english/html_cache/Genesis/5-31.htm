Lamech's lifespan, like those of other antediluvian patriarchs, reflects the long lifespans recorded in Genesis, which some interpret as literal and others as symbolic. These extended lifespans may indicate a period of human history with different environmental conditions or serve to emphasize the longevity and significance of these early figures in God's plan.<p><b>and then he died</b><br>The phrase "and then he died" is a recurring refrain in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, underscoring the reality of death as a consequence of sin, as introduced in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. Despite the long lifespans, death remains inevitable, highlighting the fallen state of humanity. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the hope for redemption and eternal life, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The genealogy in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> ultimately leads to Noah, who becomes a type of Christ as a savior figure during the flood, prefiguring the ultimate salvation brought by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lamech.htm">Lamech</a></b><br>A descendant of Adam through Seth, Lamech is the father of Noah.

links verse 31 to the flow of <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, where each entry follows a set pattern (<a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3&#8211;30</a>).<p>- It signals continuity: God is faithfully recording an unbroken lineage from Adam to Noah, just as He later will from Abraham to David to Christ (cf. <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23&#8211;38</a>).<p>- The connection reminds us that Scripture presents real history, not myth; each name and year fits into God&#8217;s larger redemptive timeline (<a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; 10:32).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lamech</b><p>- This Lamech is the son of Methuselah and the father of Noah (<a href="/genesis/5-25.htm">Genesis 5:25, 28</a>&#8211;29).<p>- Unlike the violent Lamech of Cain&#8217;s line (<a href="/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18&#8211;24</a>), this man anticipates relief through his son: &#8220;He named him Noah, saying, &#8216;May this one comfort us&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>).<p>- His place in the tenth generation from Adam underscores God&#8217;s orderly progression toward the Flood and, ultimately, toward Christ (<a href="/luke/3-36.htm">Luke 3:36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lived</b><p>- &#8220;Lived&#8221; stresses actual, measurable life on earth&#8212;years filled with work, worship, and waiting for God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>).<p>- The repeated phrase &#8220;and he lived&#8221; throughout the chapter counters any idea that these patriarchs were legendary; their existence is as concrete as Adam&#8217;s (<a href="/genesis/5-5.htm">Genesis 5:5</a>) and Noah&#8217;s (<a href="/genesis/9-28.htm">Genesis 9:28&#8211;29</a>).<p>- Long lives before the Flood point to a world still fresh from creation, yet already bearing the curse of sin (<a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A total of 777 years</b><p>- The number is literal, yet it also resonates symbolically:<p>&#8226; Three sevens echo completeness and divine perfection (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; It stands in contrast to Cain&#8217;s Lamech, who boasted of &#8220;seventy-sevenfold&#8221; vengeance (<a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>), highlighting a righteous line versus a violent one.<p>&#8226; Though lengthy, 777 is shorter than Methuselah&#8217;s 969 (<a href="/genesis/5-27.htm">Genesis 5:27</a>), illustrating that death spared no one, no matter how long they lived.<p>- These extraordinary ages show God&#8217;s patience before judgment (<a href="/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8&#8211;10</a>) and His ability to sustain life beyond modern experience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And then he died</b><p>- The refrain &#8220;and then he died&#8221; dominates <a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>, sounding the toll of sin&#8217;s consequence promised in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and explained in <a href="/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>.<p>- Only Enoch breaks the pattern, being taken by God (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>), foreshadowing resurrection hope (<a href="/hebrews/11-5.htm">Hebrews 11:5</a>).<p>- Lamech&#8217;s death, like every patriarch&#8217;s, underlines humanity&#8217;s need for the ultimate Deliverer&#8212;fulfilled in Jesus, who declares, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221; (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31</a> records, in one concise sentence, a faithful man&#8217;s place in the pre-Flood world. The connective &#8220;So&#8221; roots Lamech in real history; his name ties him to Noah and God&#8217;s unfolding plan; &#8220;lived&#8221; affirms tangible existence; the exact 777 years showcase both literal longevity and the perfect timing of God; and &#8220;then he died&#8221; drives home the universality of death and our need for redemption. The verse quietly yet powerfully points ahead to judgment, mercy, and the coming Savior who alone conquers death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/5-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Lamech</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1428;&#1502;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;me&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3929.htm">Strong's 3929: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lamech -- a descendant of Cain, also a descendant of Seth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a total of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">777</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1489;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7651.htm">Strong's 7651: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seven, seven times, a week, an indefinite number</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and then he died.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1469;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/5-31.htm">Genesis 5:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/5-31.htm">OT Law: Genesis 5:31 All the days of Lamech were seven (Gen.
