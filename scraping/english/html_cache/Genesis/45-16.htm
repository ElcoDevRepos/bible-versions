Pharaoh's house refers to the palace, the center of political and administrative power in Egypt. The news reaching Pharaoh's house signifies the importance of Joseph's position as second-in-command. Historically, Egypt was a powerful and centralized state, and the Pharaoh's house would have been a hub of activity and decision-making. This moment highlights the integration of Joseph, a Hebrew, into the highest echelons of Egyptian society, which is significant given the cultural and ethnic divisions of the time.<p><b>that Joseph&#8217;s brothers had come</b><br>The arrival of Joseph's brothers in Egypt is a pivotal moment in the narrative of Genesis. It marks the beginning of the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) where his family would bow to him. This event is also a key step in the unfolding of God's plan to preserve the family of Israel during the famine. The brothers' presence in Egypt sets the stage for the eventual migration of Jacob's entire family to Egypt, which is a critical development in the history of Israel. This migration is later referenced in Exodus as the beginning of the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt, leading to their eventual enslavement and the Exodus.<p><b>Pharaoh and his servants were pleased</b><br>The positive reaction of Pharaoh and his servants to the arrival of Joseph's brothers underscores Joseph's favor and influence in Egypt. It reflects the high regard in which Joseph was held, not only by Pharaoh but also by the Egyptian court. This acceptance is significant given the cultural and ethnic differences between the Egyptians and the Hebrews. The pleasure of Pharaoh and his servants can also be seen as a divine orchestration, where God uses Joseph's position to ensure the survival of the Israelites. This moment foreshadows the later acceptance and settlement of Jacob's family in the land of Goshen, which Pharaoh himself will facilitate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The central figure in this account, Joseph is the son of Jacob who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who had appointed Joseph as his second-in-command due to Joseph's God-given ability to interpret dreams and his wise management during the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph&#8217;s Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who had previously sold Joseph into slavery.
