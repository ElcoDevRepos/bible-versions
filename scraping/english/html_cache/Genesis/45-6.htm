The famine is part of a divine plan revealed to Joseph through Pharaoh's dreams (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>). The two years mentioned here highlight the ongoing nature of the crisis, emphasizing the need for Joseph's strategic planning and God's providence. The famine's impact extends beyond Egypt, affecting Canaan and prompting Joseph's brothers to seek grain in Egypt, fulfilling God's purpose of reuniting Joseph with his family.<p><b>and there will be five more years</b><br>This prophecy underscores the total duration of the famine as seven years, a number often associated with completeness in the Bible. Joseph's ability to predict the future famine years demonstrates his God-given wisdom and the fulfillment of God's plan. The additional five years emphasize the need for continued reliance on God's provision and Joseph's leadership. This period of famine serves as a backdrop for the reconciliation and preservation of Jacob's family, which is crucial for the unfolding of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>without plowing or harvesting</b><br>The absence of plowing or harvesting indicates the severity of the famine, as agricultural activities are halted. This situation reflects the dependence of ancient societies on agriculture and the vulnerability to natural disasters. The lack of food production would have led to widespread scarcity and hardship, highlighting the importance of Joseph's foresight in storing grain during the years of abundance. This phrase also foreshadows the Israelites' future reliance on God's provision, as seen in the wilderness wanderings where God provided manna (Exodus 16). The famine narrative serves as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and salvation in times of spiritual famine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.
