It is significant in biblical history as a place where the Israelites wandered during their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>). This area is associated with desolation and testing, reflecting Ishmael's own life journey. The wilderness setting underscores themes of survival and divine provision, as God had promised to make Ishmael a great nation (<a href="/genesis/21-18.htm">Genesis 21:18</a>). Paran's harsh environment also symbolizes the challenges Ishmael would face, yet it is here that he begins to establish his own identity apart from Abraham's household.<p><b>his mother got a wife for him</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was customary for parents to arrange marriages for their children. Hagar, Ishmael's mother, takes on this responsibility, indicating her continued role in his life and her concern for his future. This action also reflects the matriarchal influence in Ishmael's upbringing, as Hagar was an Egyptian and likely sought a wife who shared cultural and familial ties. The choice of a wife is crucial for establishing Ishmael's lineage and fulfilling God's promise of making him a great nation.<p><b>from the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt holds significant historical and cultural importance in the biblical narrative. It was a place of refuge and sustenance, as seen in Abraham's earlier journey there during a famine (<a href="/genesis/12-10.htm">Genesis 12:10</a>). For Hagar, an Egyptian by birth, returning to her homeland to find a wife for Ishmael suggests a connection to her roots and heritage. This choice may also imply a strategic alliance, as Egypt was a powerful nation. Theologically, Egypt often represents a place of both refuge and bondage, foreshadowing future events in Israel's history. The marriage alliance with Egypt could be seen as a way to ensure Ishmael's prosperity and survival, aligning with God's promise to bless him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Hagar, who was sent away from Abraham's household.

This shows that Ishmael&#8217;s new home was no accident but a divinely guided placement, fulfilling the promise that he would become &#8220;a great nation&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike Isaac, who remains near Abraham&#8217;s tents, Ishmael&#8217;s dwelling foreshadows a life lived on the margins&#8212;yet still under God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the Wilderness of Paran</b><p>&#8226; Paran lies between Canaan and Egypt (<a href="/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>). It is a harsh, expansive desert, emphasizing Ishmael&#8217;s identity as a rugged, independent man (<a href="/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God often meets His people in wilderness settings&#8212;Moses at Horeb (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>), Israel&#8217;s forty-year journey (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>), and Elijah&#8217;s renewal (<a href="/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4-8</a>). Ishmael&#8217;s wilderness home signals that isolation need not equal abandonment; God&#8217;s presence reaches there, too.<p>&#8226; Paran later becomes a launching point for Israel&#8217;s exploration of Canaan (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a>), linking Ishmael&#8217;s territory to the unfolding story of redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother got a wife for him</b><p>&#8226; Hagar takes the initiative, just as Abraham arranges a bride for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>) and later Isaac directs Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1-2</a>). Parental involvement in marriage honored God-given authority and safeguarded covenant values.<p>&#8226; The move underscores Hagar&#8217;s continued care and God-given responsibility toward her son, echoing the earlier angelic instruction, &#8220;Lift up the boy and take him by the hand&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-18.htm">Genesis 21:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Ishmael is now a capable archer, family influence still shapes his future, reminding us that individual freedom and parental guidance can work together under God&#8217;s design (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Hagar herself is Egyptian (<a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1</a>), so returning to her homeland for a wife keeps Ishmael connected to his maternal heritage.<p>&#8226; Marrying an Egyptian distinguishes Ishmael from Isaac, whose bride comes from Abraham&#8217;s kin in Mesopotamia (<a href="/genesis/24-4.htm">Genesis 24:4</a>). This divergence affirms two separate lines: the covenant line through Isaac (<a href="/galatians/4-28.htm">Galatians 4:28</a>) and the non-covenant but still God-blessed line through Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Egypt often symbolizes worldly strength (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), yet God still works within that context to fulfill His promise that Ishmael would father twelve princes (<a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-16</a>). His mixed background anticipates God&#8217;s later inclusion of all nations through Christ (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>), even while maintaining the unique covenant with Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a> records three simple facts&#8212;where Ishmael lived, who secured his marriage, and where his wife came from&#8212;but each detail reveals God&#8217;s ongoing faithfulness. In the wild expanse of Paran, Ishmael grows under divine care. Through Hagar&#8217;s active role, God provides a wife, anchoring Ishmael&#8217;s future. By drawing from Egypt, the Lord keeps His promise to bless Hagar&#8217;s son while distinguishing Ishmael&#8217;s line from Isaac&#8217;s covenant line. The verse testifies that even outside the promised land and covenant family, God remains present, guiding lives and fulfilling every word He has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">A wife out of the land of Egypt.</span>--However natural this might be on Hagar's part, it would never theless strengthen the heathen element in Ishmael and his descendants.
