In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, family ties were crucial, and the role of the mother was significant in guiding her children. Rebekah's use of "my son" underscores her authority and emotional connection, which she leverages to influence Jacob's actions.<p><b>listen to my voice</b><br>Listening to one's parents was a fundamental expectation in biblical times, rooted in the commandment to honor one's father and mother (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Rebekah's insistence on Jacob listening to her voice highlights the importance of obedience within the family structure. This phrase also echoes the broader biblical theme of listening to God's voice, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, where Israel is called to hear and obey the Lord.<p><b>and do exactly as I tell you</b><br>Rebekah's directive to Jacob to follow her instructions precisely reflects the urgency and importance of the task at hand. This mirrors other biblical instances where precise obedience is required, such as God's instructions to Noah regarding the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) or Moses concerning the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>). The emphasis on exactness also foreshadows the meticulous nature of God's law and the need for Israel to adhere to His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>- The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

Rebekah recognizes that Isaac is about to pronounce the patriarchal blessing (<a href="/genesis/27-4.htm">Genesis 27:4</a>), and immediate action is required.<p>- Similar moments of decisive timing appear when Joseph urges his brothers, &#8220;Quickly bring my father down here&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/45-13.htm">Genesis 45:13</a>), and when Jesus says, &#8220;Now is the Son of Man glorified&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a>), underscoring that God&#8217;s purposes often hinge on critical &#8220;now&#8221; moments.<p>- Here, &#8220;Now&#8221; reminds us that God works in real time through real choices, even when those choices (as in Rebekah&#8217;s plan) involve human frailty and moral tension (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my son</b><p>- The phrase reflects maternal intimacy and authority. Rebekah&#8217;s bond with Jacob echoes earlier parental instructions such as &#8220;Hear, my son, your father&#8217;s instruction&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>) and &#8220;Children, obey your parents in the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1</a>).<p>- Yet the family dynamic is complicated: favoritism has already been noted (<a href="/genesis/25-28.htm">Genesis 25:28</a>). While Rebekah&#8217;s affection is genuine, her partiality sets the stage for conflict, reminding us of the cautionary example of Isaac&#8217;s own father Abraham when he favored Isaac over Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>listen to my voice</b><p>- Rebekah seeks Jacob&#8217;s attentive obedience, paralleling God&#8217;s covenant call: &#8220;If you will indeed listen to My voice and keep My covenant&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>).<p>- The phrase anticipates Christ&#8217;s words, &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>), highlighting that listening implies trust and readiness to act.<p>- Jacob&#8217;s willingness to heed Rebekah mirrors earlier scenes of obedience, such as Isaac following Abraham to Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-6.htm">Genesis 22:6&#8211;8</a>), yet the moral outcome differs; here, listening leads to deception rather than sacrificial faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and do exactly as I tell you</b><p>- Rebekah emphasizes precise compliance, echoing commands like &#8220;Be careful to do as the LORD your God has commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>) and Samuel&#8217;s reminder that obedience is better than sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>- Her instruction will demand bold, risky steps&#8212;fetching goats, disguising as Esau, presenting the meal (<a href="/genesis/27-9.htm">Genesis 27:9&#8211;17</a>). Each detail must be followed, underscoring how specific obedience can carry weighty consequences.<p>- While Scripture later condemns deceit (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>), the narrative shows that God can still accomplish His sovereign purposes through imperfect human choices, as reflected when Paul notes that God&#8217;s mercy &#8220;does not depend on man&#8217;s desire or effort, but on God&#8217;s mercy&#8221; (<a href="/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-8.htm">Genesis 27:8</a> captures a pivotal, urgent command from a mother to her favored son: act now, trust me, and obey completely. Each phrase layers urgency, relationship, attentive hearing, and exact obedience. Though Rebekah&#8217;s plan involves questionable ethics, the verse teaches that moments of decisive obedience&#8212;rightly directed&#8212;can shape destinies. God&#8217;s overarching plan for the promised blessing to rest on Jacob moves forward, demonstrating that His purposes stand even amid human imperfection, calling us to listen carefully, act faithfully, and trust His sovereign hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, my son</span>, - Jacob at this time was not a lad, but a grown man of mature years (if Isaac was 137, he must have been 77), which shows that in the following transaction he was rather an accomplice than a tool - <span class="cmt_word">obey my voice according to that which I command thee.</span> We can scarcely here think of a mother laying her imperative instructions on a docile and unquestioning child;
