In the patriarchal society of the Old Testament, a woman's worth was often measured by her ability to produce offspring, particularly sons. Rachel's inability to conceive would have been a source of personal anguish and social stigma. This situation echoes the experiences of other biblical matriarchs, such as Sarah and Hannah, who also faced periods of barrenness before God intervened. The theme of barrenness and subsequent divine intervention highlights God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His covenant promises through the lineage of the patriarchs.<p><b>she envied her sister</b><br>Rachel's envy of Leah underscores the complex dynamics within Jacob's family. Leah, though less loved by Jacob, was able to bear him children, which increased her status and influence within the family. Envy is a recurring human emotion in the Bible, often leading to conflict and strife, as seen in the stories of Cain and Abel, and Joseph and his brothers. This familial tension foreshadows the future discord among Jacob's sons, which will play a crucial role in the narrative of Israel's history. The Bible frequently warns against envy, as it can lead to destructive behavior and disrupt relationships.<p><b>&#8220;Give me children, or I will die!&#8221; she said to Jacob</b><br>Rachel's desperate plea to Jacob reveals the depth of her distress and the societal pressure she felt. Her statement reflects the belief that a woman's primary role was to bear children, and without fulfilling this role, her life felt incomplete. This intense desire for children can be seen in other biblical accounts, such as Hannah's prayer for a son in <a href="/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1</a>. Rachel's demand also highlights the human tendency to seek fulfillment and identity in circumstances rather than in God. Her words foreshadow the eventual birth of Joseph, who will become a pivotal figure in the history of Israel, demonstrating God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises despite human frailty and impatience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who is struggling with infertility and is envious of her sister Leah's ability to bear children.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is caught between the rivalry of his two wives, Rachel and Leah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>Rachel's sister and Jacob's first wife, who has already borne several children to Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/envy.htm">Envy</a></b><br>The emotion that Rachel experiences, which drives her to desperation and confrontation with Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/childbearing.htm">Childbearing</a></b><br>A significant cultural and personal issue in the account, representing legacy and divine blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_envy.htm">The Danger of Envy</a></b><br>Envy can lead to destructive behavior and strained relationships.

This reflects the high value Scripture places on children as tangible evidence of God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement follows a long pattern of barrenness among the matriarchs&#8212;Sarah (<a href="/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>; 21:1-2) and Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/25-21.htm">Genesis 25:21</a>). In each case, God alone ultimately opens the womb, underscoring His sovereign control (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>; 30:22).<p>&#8226; Rachel&#8217;s &#8220;seeing&#8221; highlights the contrast between her situation and Leah&#8217;s: Leah has already delivered four sons (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32-35</a>). The tension rising in Jacob&#8217;s household is therefore rooted in visible, countable blessings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she envied her sister</b><p>&#8226; Envy surfaces when blessings granted to another are viewed as diminishing one&#8217;s own worth (<a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Rachel&#8217;s envy exposes a heart problem, not merely a social one. God&#8217;s law will later forbid coveting anything that belongs to a neighbor (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s fertility, rather than stirring Rachel to prayerful trust, provokes unhealthy rivalry. Similar competitive feelings fuel later strife between their sons (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Give me children, or I will die!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The cry reveals desperation so intense that childbearing has become Rachel&#8217;s functional idol. Scripture warns that craving a good gift more than the Giver leads to bondage (<a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Ironically, Rachel&#8217;s words foreshadow her own death in childbirth with Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/35-16.htm">Genesis 35:16-19</a>), underscoring how uncontrolled desire can have tragic consequences.<p>&#8226; Compare Hannah, who also longed for a child but poured out her heart to the LORD rather than to her husband (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10-11</a>). God invites lament, yet His people must direct it toward Him, not human intermediaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she said to Jacob</b><p>&#8226; Rachel directs her demand at Jacob, but Jacob cannot open her womb. His immediate reply in the next verse&#8212;&#8220;Am I in the place of God?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-2.htm">Genesis 30:2</a>)&#8212;is the correct theological answer.<p>&#8226; Depending on a human rather than God puts pressure on relationships that were never designed to carry divine weight (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode highlights Jacob&#8217;s passive leadership at this stage and points to the need for a husband to steer his family back to trust in the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a> exposes the danger of measuring worth by earthly benchmarks, even good ones like children. Rachel&#8217;s envy, desperate cry, and misplaced demand show how quickly unmet desires can eclipse trust in God&#8217;s timing. The verse invites believers to recognize God alone as the Giver of life, resist envy, and bring every longing to Him rather than to fallible human solutions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XXX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Give me children, or else I die.</span>--There is an Oriental proverb that a childless person is as good as dead; and this was probably Rachel's meaning, and not that she should die of vexation. Great as was the affliction to a Hebrew woman of being barren (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm" title="And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to the LORD, and wept sore.">1Samuel 1:10</a>), yet there is a painful petulance and peevishness about Rachel's words, in strong contrast with Hannah's patient suffering. But she was very young, and a spoiled wife; though with qualities which riveted Jacob's love to her all life through.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when Rachel saw</span> (apparently after, though probably before, the birth of Leah's fourth son) <span class="cmt_word">that she bare Jacob no children</span> (literally, <span class="accented">that she bare not to Jacob</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Rachel envied her sister</span> (was jealous of her, the root referring to the redness with which the face of an angry woman is suffused); <span class="cmt_word">and said unto Jacob, Give me children</span> (sons), <span class="cmt_word">or else I die</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and if not</span>, <span class="accented">I am a dead woman</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for shame at her sterility. Rachel had three strong reasons for desiring children - that she might emulate her sister, become more dear to her husband, and above all share the hope of being a progenitrix of the promised Seed. If not warranted to infer that Rachel s barrenness was due to lack of prayer on her part and Jacob s (Keil), we are at least justified in asserting that her conduct in breaking forth into angry reproaches against her husband was unlike that of Jacob's mother, Rebekah, who, in similar circumstances, sought relief in prayer and oracles (Kalisch). The brief period that had elapsed since Rachel's marriage, in comparison with the twenty years of Rebekah's barrenness, signally discovered Rachel's sinful impatience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/30-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Rachel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7354.htm">Strong's 7354: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rachel -- a wife of Jacob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#234;&#183;re)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
