This act of imprisonment is significant in the narrative of Joseph's life, as it mirrors his own experience of being unjustly imprisoned in Egypt. The three-day period is often symbolic in the Bible, representing a time of trial or testing, as seen in other instances such as Jonah in the belly of the fish and Jesus in the tomb.<br><br>The act of imprisonment also serves to heighten the tension in the story, as Joseph's brothers are unaware of his true identity and are forced to confront their past actions. This period of confinement allows them to reflect on their treatment of Joseph and the resulting consequences. It is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for their eventual reconciliation.<br><br>In a broader biblical context, the number three often signifies completeness or divine intervention. This can be seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day, which brings about redemption and new beginnings. Similarly, Joseph's actions lead to a transformation in his brothers, ultimately resulting in the preservation of the family line through which the Messiah would come.<br><br>The geographical setting of Egypt is also significant, as it was a place of both refuge and testing for the Israelites throughout biblical history.

Joseph has accused his ten brothers of spying (<a href="/genesis/42-9.htm">Genesis 42:9&#8211;14</a>), tested the truthfulness of their story, and announced that one brother must stay behind while the rest return home with grain (<a href="/genesis/42-15.htm">Genesis 42:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>- By beginning with &#8220;So,&#8221; Scripture presents the imprisonment as the logical outcome of Joseph&#8217;s stated plan. It is the next step in a purposeful sequence, similar to how earlier transitions move events forward&#8212;&#8220;So Potiphar put him in the house of the captain of the guard&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-20.htm">Genesis 39:20</a>) and &#8220;So Pharaoh sent for Joseph&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>).<p>- The text therefore invites us to read Joseph&#8217;s action not as random anger or revenge but as a deliberate part of God&#8217;s unfolding plan, echoing <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, where God works through every step for good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph imprisoned them</b><p>- The phrase is straightforward: Joseph, wielding Egyptian authority, &#8220;imprisoned them.&#8221; Scripture portrays an actual physical confinement, not merely a metaphor, underscoring the literal truthfulness of the narrative.<p>- Imprisonment is a striking reversal. Years earlier the brothers confined Joseph in a cistern and sold him (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23&#8211;28</a>). Now they feel the weight of bondage, fulfilling <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>: &#8220;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221;<p>- This short captivity serves several purposes:<p>&#8226; It exposes the brothers&#8217; guilt; their later conversation&#8212;&#8220;Surely we are being punished because of our brother&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>)&#8212;shows conscience awakened.<p>&#8226; It establishes Joseph&#8217;s credibility before his servants; Pharaoh&#8217;s officials observe his firmness, just as in <a href="/genesis/41-44.htm">Genesis 41:44</a> Joseph acted with full royal authority.<p>&#8226; It positions the brothers, and eventually Jacob&#8217;s entire family, for reconciliation, paralleling how God often uses hardship to bring repentance (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for three days</b><p>- The text specifies a literal duration: &#8220;for three days.&#8221; Scripture repeatedly uses three-day intervals in redemptive moments.<p>&#8226; Jonah was in the fish &#8220;three days and three nights&#8221; before deliverance (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel waited three days at Sinai before God&#8217;s revelation (<a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Esther asked the Jews to fast three days before her approach to the king (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Most climactic of all, Christ was in the tomb three days before rising (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).<p>- Three days give the brothers time to think, repent, and fear God, mirroring how Joseph had earlier spent time in Pharaoh&#8217;s prison pondering God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/genesis/40-14.htm">Genesis 40:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>- The duration also builds dramatic tension. Joseph&#8217;s next words&#8212;&#8220;Do this and you will live, for I fear God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/42-18.htm">Genesis 42:18</a>)&#8212;introduce grace after a measured pause, much like God&#8217;s pattern of discipline followed by mercy (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17</a> records a real, purposeful act: &#8220;So Joseph imprisoned them for three days.&#8221; The conjunction &#8220;So&#8221; links it to Joseph&#8217;s divine strategy, the act of imprisonment confronts the brothers with their past sin, and the three-day span provides space for reflection and sets the stage for mercy. In this brief sentence God&#8217;s sovereign hand is evident, turning human wrongdoing toward eventual repentance, family restoration, and the preservation of the covenant line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he put them all together into ward</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and he assembled them into prison</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>three days</span>. Ostensibly in consequence of their unwillingness to agree to his proposal, but in reality to give them an experience of the suffering which they had inflicted on him, their brother, and so to awaken in their hearts a feeling of repentance. Yet the clemency of Joseph appears in this, that whereas he had lain three long years in prison as the result of their inhumanity towards him, he only inflicts on them a confinement of three days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/42-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joseph imprisoned them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1505;&#1465;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ye&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;s&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_622.htm">Strong's 622: </a> </span><span class="str2">To gather for, any purpose, to receive, take away, remove</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/42-17.htm">Genesis 42:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/42-17.htm">OT Law: Genesis 42:17 He put them all together into custody (Gen.
