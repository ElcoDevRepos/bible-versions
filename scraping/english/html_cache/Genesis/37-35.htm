The mention of "sons and daughters" indicates a family effort to console Jacob, highlighting the communal nature of family life in ancient Israel. This reflects the cultural importance of family unity and support during times of grief. The attempt to comfort Jacob also underscores the depth of his sorrow, as it is a collective effort that ultimately proves unsuccessful.<p><b>but he refused to be comforted</b><br>Jacob's refusal to be comforted demonstrates the profound depth of his grief. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, mourning was a significant and often prolonged process, but Jacob's reaction is particularly intense. This refusal can be seen as a reflection of his deep love for Joseph and the perceived finality of his loss. It also foreshadows the enduring nature of his sorrow, which will only be alleviated upon his eventual reunion with Joseph in Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son.&#8221;</b><br>Sheol, in the Hebrew Bible, is often understood as the realm of the dead, a place of darkness and silence. Jacob's statement indicates his belief that he will mourn Joseph until his own death, suggesting a lifelong grief. This phrase also reflects the ancient understanding of death and the afterlife, where Sheol was seen as a common destination for all, regardless of righteousness. Jacob's expression of mourning until death highlights the intensity of his despair and the perceived permanence of his loss.<p><b>So his father wept for him.</b><br>The act of weeping is a natural expression of grief and loss, and in the biblical narrative, it often signifies deep emotional pain. Jacob's weeping is a personal and poignant response to the loss of Joseph, emphasizing the human aspect of the patriarch's experience. This moment also serves as a narrative device to underscore the gravity of the brothers' deception and the resulting family tragedy. The weeping of Jacob can be seen as a type of Christ, who also wept over Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>) and at the tomb of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>),

4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Their attempt shows that outward rituals of sympathy can coexist with inward sin&#8212;an early warning against hypocrisy (cf. <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he refused to be comforted.</b><p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s grief is so profound that normal means of consolation cannot penetrate it (cf. <a href="/psalms/77-2.htm">Psalm

permits in suffering.<p>&#8226; Genuine faith does not negate real emotion; it brings it into the open before God (cf. <a href="/job/3-24.htm">Job 3:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said.</b><p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s single-word rejection underscores a conscious choice to remain in lament.<p>&#8226; His &#8220;No&#8221; parallels David&#8217;s initial refusal to eat while the child of Bathsheba was sick (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16-17</a>). Both patriarchs model that grief can include resolute silence toward attempted relief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jacob expects to carry his sorrow to the grave; &#8220;Sheol&#8221; here is the place of the dead, not merely poetic metaphor (cf. <a href="/genesis/42-38.htm">Genesis 42:38</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>).<p>&#8226; His statement shows belief in continued existence after death, anticipating fuller revelation in texts like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>.<p>&#8226; Mourning &#8220;for my son&#8221; signals how deeply covenant families are knit together; the loss of one covenant child feels like a tearing of the entire promise (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So his father wept for him.</b><p>&#8226; The narrative pauses on Jacob&#8217;s weeping, validating tears as a godly response to loss (cf. <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>).<p>&#8226; These tears invite readers to trust that God records every sorrow (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>) and will one day wipe away every tear (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a> shows the depth of a father&#8217;s grief over his presumed-dead son. Family attempts at comfort fail because Jacob&#8217;s sorrow is both sincere and unresolved. His refusal, his declaration about Sheol, and his tears emphasize that life in a fallen world includes seasons where consolation seems impossible. Yet even in unrelenting lament, Scripture quietly points to God&#8217;s larger story: the hidden preservation of Joseph, the eventual reunion, and&#8212;through Joseph&#8217;s line&#8212;the coming Savior who will finally turn mourning into joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Into the grave.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Sheol, </span>which, like Hades in Greek, means the place of departed spirits.
