In the ancient Near East, pastoralism was a common way of life, and this statement underscores the Israelites' identity as shepherds. This occupation was passed down through generations, indicating a deep-rooted cultural heritage. The patriarchs, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were all involved in livestock management, which was a significant part of their wealth and livelihood (<a href="/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>, <a href="/genesis/26-14.htm">Genesis 26:14</a>). This tradition also foreshadows the future role of Israel as shepherds of God's people, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture (Psalm 23, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>Then you will be allowed to settle in the land of Goshen,</b><br>Goshen was a fertile region in the northeastern part of Egypt, ideal for grazing livestock. This area provided the Israelites with the resources needed to thrive and grow as a nation. The strategic location of Goshen allowed them to maintain their distinct cultural and religious identity while being in proximity to the Egyptian civilization. This settlement in Goshen was part of God's providential plan to preserve and multiply the Israelites, setting the stage for their eventual exodus and fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p><b>since all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians.&#8221;</b><br>The Egyptians' disdain for shepherds is rooted in cultural and social differences. Egyptians were primarily an agrarian society, and their religious practices often involved the worship of animals, which may have contributed to their aversion to those who raised livestock. This cultural bias ensured that the Israelites would remain separate from the Egyptians, preserving their identity and preventing assimilation. This separation is significant in the biblical narrative, as it allowed the Israelites to grow into a distinct nation, fulfilling God's covenant promises. The theme of separation from surrounding nations is echoed throughout Scripture, emphasizing holiness and dedication to God (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The son of Jacob who became a powerful leader in Egypt.

Their occupation, despised by Egyptians, becomes the very means God employs to preserve and multiply His people in a protected, fertile region. The verse reveals divine wisdom working through honest words, cultural realities, and humble vocations to accomplish covenant purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">For every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</span>--This is probably a remark of the narrator, and it is confirmed by the monuments, which generally represent shepherds as unshaven and ill-dressed. Necessarily the Egyptians had sheep and cattle (<a href="/context/genesis/47-16.htm" title="And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.">Genesis 47:16-17</a>), and even Pharaoh had herds (<a href="/genesis/47-6.htm" title="The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if you know any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.">Genesis 47:6</a>); but the care of them was probably left by the peasantry to the women and children, while the men busied themselves with the cultivation of their fields. We need not go far to seek for the cause of this dislike. The word "abomination," first of all, suggests a religious ground of difference; and not only did shepherds probably kill animals worshipped in different Egyptian districts, but their religion generally was diverse from that of the fixed population. But next, men who lead a settled life always dislike wandering clans, whose cattle are too likely to prey upon their enclosed land (see Note on <a href="/genesis/4-8.htm" title="And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.">Genesis 4:8</a>), and who, moving from place to place, are usually not very scrupulous as to the rights of property. Such nomades, too, are generally lower in civilisation, and more rude and rough, than men who have fixed homes. The subjugation of Egypt by the Hyksos was possibly subsequent to the era of Joseph; but we now know from Egyptian sources that there was perpetual war between Egypt and the Hittites, and probably raids were often made upon the rich fields on the banks of the Nile by other Semitic tribes dwelling upon its eastern frontier; and as all these wore regarded as shepherds, there was ground enough for the dislike of all nomades as a class, even though the Egyptians did not disdain to have cattle themselves. But as the land in the Nile Valley was arable, the cattle kept would only be such as were useful for agriculture, whereas they formed the main wealth of the Israelites.<p><span class= "bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/46-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you are to say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;mar&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
