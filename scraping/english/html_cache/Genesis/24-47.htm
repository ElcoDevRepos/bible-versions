In the patriarchal society of the Old Testament, knowing one's family background was crucial for marriage alliances and inheritance rights. This inquiry reflects the servant's diligence in ensuring that Rebekah was from Abraham's kin, fulfilling Abraham's instructions to find a wife for Isaac from his own family (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>).<p><b>She replied, &#8216;The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.&#8217;</b><br>Rebekah's response confirms her as a suitable match for Isaac, as she is a direct relative of Abraham. Nahor was Abraham's brother, and Milcah was Nahor's wife, making Rebekah a grand-niece to Abraham. This connection is significant because it maintains the purity of the Abrahamic line, which is central to the unfolding of God's covenant promises. The mention of Milcah also emphasizes the matriarchal lineage, which is often highlighted in biblical genealogies.<p><b>So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.</b><br>The giving of jewelry was a customary practice in ancient Near Eastern betrothal rituals, symbolizing the establishment of a marriage covenant. The nose ring and bracelets were not only gifts but also a sign of the servant's recognition of God's guidance in choosing Rebekah. This act signifies the formalization of the engagement, paralleling the New Testament concept of the church as the bride of Christ, adorned and prepared for her bridegroom (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>). The adornment also reflects the wealth and status of Abraham's household, indicating the honor and value placed on Rebekah as Isaac's future wife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>- The patriarch who sent his servant to find a wife for his son Isaac.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>- Abraham's son, for whom the servant is seeking a wife.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>- The woman identified as the suitable wife for Isaac.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethuel.htm">Bethuel</a></b><br>- Rebekah's father, son of Nahor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahor.htm">Nahor</a></b><br>- Abraham's brother, making Rebekah a relative of Abraham.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/m/milcah.htm">Milcah</a></b><br>- Nahor's wife and Rebekah's grandmother.<br><br>7. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>- Abraham's trusted servant, traditionally identified as Eliezer, tasked with finding Isaac's wife.<br><br>8. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>- The city where Nahor's family lived, and where the servant found Rebekah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance_in_decision_making.htm">Divine Guidance in Decision Making</a></b><br>The servant's reliance on God for guidance in choosing a wife for Isaac highlights the importance of seeking divine direction in our decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_and_heritage.htm">Family and Heritage</a></b><br>The emphasis on Rebekah's lineage underscores the value of family and heritage in God's plan, reminding us to honor our own family ties and heritage.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_commitment.htm">Symbolism of Commitment</a></b><br>The giving of the ring and bracelets symbolizes commitment and covenant, teaching us about the importance of commitment in relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>The servant's dedication to his task reflects the importance of faithfulness in our responsibilities, encouraging us to serve diligently in our roles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_provision.htm">God's Sovereignty and Provision</a></b><br>The successful outcome of the servant's mission demonstrates God's sovereignty and provision, reassuring us of His control and care in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_24_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 24:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_24_47_God_s_guidance_in_marriage.htm">How does Genesis 24:47 demonstrate God's guidance in choosing a spouse?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_prayer_in_Genesis_24_47.htm">What role does prayer play in decision-making, as seen in Genesis 24:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_24_47_Proverbs_3_5-6_link.htm">How does Genesis 24:47 connect with Proverbs 3:5-6 on trusting God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Seek_God_s_will_in_relationships_Gen_24_47.htm">How can we seek God's will in relationships, following Genesis 24:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Servant_s_actions_teach_obedience.htm">What can we learn about obedience from the servant's actions in Genesis 24:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_24_47_and_ancient_marriage_customs.htm">How does Genesis 24:47 reflect ancient marriage customs and their significance in biblical times?
