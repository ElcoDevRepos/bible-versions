His name is associated with the term "Hebrew," which is used to describe the descendants of Abraham. The age of 34, while not particularly symbolic, indicates the early maturity and family responsibilities typical in ancient times. This period in Genesis is post-Flood, where lifespans were gradually decreasing, yet people still lived much longer than today. Eber's lineage is crucial as it connects to the line of Shem, one of Noah's sons, emphasizing the continuity of God's covenant through specific family lines.<p><b>he became the father of Peleg</b><br>Peleg's name is significant as it means "division" in Hebrew. This is traditionally linked to the division of the earth, which some scholars associate with the Tower of Babel event described earlier in <a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>. This division could refer to the scattering of peoples and languages, marking a pivotal moment in human history. Peleg's birth is a chronological marker in the genealogical record, highlighting the fulfillment of God's plan through specific individuals. The genealogies in Genesis serve to trace the lineage leading to Abraham, and ultimately to Jesus Christ, underscoring the theme of divine providence and the unfolding of salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eber.htm">Eber</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, Eber is an important figure in the genealogical line leading to Abraham.

Eber represents a link in the chain of God's unfolding plan for humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peleg.htm">Peleg</a></b><br>The son of Eber, Peleg's name means "division," which is significant because it is during his lifetime that the earth was divided, possibly referring to the division of languages at the Tower of Babel or a geographical division.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/genealogical_record.htm">Genealogical Record</a></b><br>This verse is part of the genealogical record in <a href="/bsb/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, which traces the lineage from Shem to Abram (later Abraham).

Moses does not use rounded figures; he records actual ages, inviting trust in the text&#8217;s accuracy (cf. <a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3, 6</a>: &#8220;Adam lived 130 years&#8230; Seth lived 105 years&#8230;&#8221;).<p>- Counting backward from other ages in <a href="/bsb/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11</a>, Eber&#8217;s 34th year falls about a century after the Flood (<a href="/genesis/11-10.htm">Genesis 11:10&#8211;15</a>), highlighting how rapidly families multiplied under God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Birth of Peleg</b><p>- Peleg means &#8220;division,&#8221; and <a href="/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a> notes, &#8220;in his days the earth was divided.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This likely points to the dispersal at Babel&#8212;God&#8217;s direct intervention scattering people groups (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Naming a child after that event preserves its memory inside the covenant line.<p>- The verse reminds us that God is sovereign over both personal milestones (a son&#8217;s birth) and global events (the dividing of nations).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Thread of Promise</b><p>- From Shem to Eber to Peleg, God keeps narrowing the line that will culminate in Abram and, eventually, Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>- Each generational note echoes earlier assurances: the woman&#8217;s Seed will come (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>); nations will be blessed through Abram (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>- By recording even &#8220;minor&#8221; figures, Scripture shows that no link in God&#8217;s redemptive chain is accidental.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Applications for Today</b><p>- Dependability: If God tracks ages and births with such precision, He can be trusted with every detail of our lives (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>).<p>- Heritage: Believers inherit a faith rooted in real history, not myth; this bolsters confidence when sharing the gospel (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>).<p>- Perspective: God weaves personal joys (a child&#8217;s birth) into His vast plan for the nations (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>), reminding us our ordinary moments carry eternal significance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-16.htm">Genesis 11:16</a> is more than a passing genealogical note.
