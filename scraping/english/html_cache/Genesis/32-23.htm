He is taking his family, which includes his wives, children, and servants. This action reflects his role as the head of the household and protector. In the broader narrative, Jacob is preparing to meet his brother Esau, whom he fears due to their past conflict. This moment is a turning point, showing Jacob's responsibility and care for his family.<p><b>and sent them across the stream</b><br>The stream referred to is the Jabbok River, a tributary of the Jordan River. This geographical detail is significant as it marks a boundary and a place of transition. In biblical symbolism, crossing water often represents a change or new beginning. This act of sending his family across first can be seen as a protective measure, ensuring their safety before he faces Esau. The Jabbok is also the site of Jacob's wrestling with God, a pivotal spiritual encounter.<p><b>along with all his possessions</b><br>Jacob's possessions include livestock and goods accumulated over years, reflecting God's blessing and fulfillment of His promise to prosper Jacob. This phrase underscores the wealth and status Jacob has achieved, which is significant in the context of his impending meeting with Esau. Historically, possessions were a sign of God's favor and a means of survival and influence.

Staying himself to the very last, he is left alone on the south side of the torrent, but still in the ravine, across which the rest had taken their way. The definite proof that Jacob remained on the south side lies in the fact that Peniel belonged to the tribe of Gad; but, besides this, there could be no reason why he should recross the rapid river when once he had gone through it, and probably the idea has risen from taking the word <span class= "ital">brook </span>in <a href="/genesis/32-23.htm" title="And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.">Genesis 32:23</a> in too narrow a sense.

When Jacob had seen his wives and herds safe on the top of the southern ridge, the deep valley would be the very place for this solitary struggle.
