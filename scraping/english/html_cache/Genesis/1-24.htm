Throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, God's spoken word is the means by which creation comes into existence. This reflects the theme of divine sovereignty and the creative power of God's word, which is echoed in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where Jesus is described as the Word through whom all things were made.<p><b>&#8220;Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds:</b><br>The command for the earth to produce living creatures highlights the order and intentionality in creation. The phrase "according to their kinds" suggests a structured and organized creation, with each species distinct and purposeful. This counters ancient Near Eastern creation myths that often depict creation as chaotic and arbitrary. The concept of "kinds" also supports the idea of fixed species, aligning with the biblical theme of God's order in creation.<p><b>livestock,</b><br>Livestock refers to domesticated animals that are useful to humans, such as cattle, sheep, and goats. In the ancient world, these animals were vital for agriculture, transportation, and religious sacrifices. The inclusion of livestock in creation underscores God's provision for human needs and foreshadows their role in the sacrificial system, which points to Christ as the ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>land crawlers,</b><br>This term likely refers to smaller creatures that move close to the ground, such as reptiles and insects. These creatures, though often overlooked, play crucial roles in the ecosystem. Their creation reflects God's attention to detail and the interconnectedness of all life. The diversity of these creatures also demonstrates God's creativity and the complexity of His creation.<p><b>and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.&#8221;</b><br>Beasts of the earth include wild animals, such as lions, bears, and other undomesticated creatures. Their creation "according to their kinds" emphasizes the diversity and richness of life on earth. These animals often symbolize strength and power in biblical literature, and their existence showcases God's majesty and the balance of nature. The presence of both domesticated and wild animals highlights the completeness of God's creation.<p><b>And it was so.</b><br>This phrase confirms the fulfillment of God's command, underscoring the effectiveness and reliability of His word. It serves as a refrain throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, affirming that God's will is accomplished perfectly. This assurance of God's sovereign control over creation provides a foundation for trust in His promises throughout Scripture, including the ultimate restoration of creation through Christ (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who speaks life into existence, demonstrating His sovereign power and authority over creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The place from which God commands the living creatures to emerge, highlighting the earth's role as a source of life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_creatures.htm">Living Creatures</a></b><br>Includes livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each created according to their kinds, emphasizing the diversity and order in God's creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority over all creation, and His word is powerful and effective.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_and_order.htm">Diversity and Order</a></b><br>Appreciate the diversity and order in creation as a reflection of God's wisdom and creativity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_of_creation.htm">Stewardship of Creation</a></b><br>As part of God's creation, humans are called to responsibly steward and care for the earth and its creatures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_and_design.htm">Purpose and Design</a></b><br>Understand that every creature has a purpose and is designed according to God's plan, encouraging us to seek our own purpose in His design.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the animals, we can trust in His provision for our needs.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_24_God_s_creation_authority.htm">How does Genesis 1:24 demonstrate God's authority over creation and its order?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Gods_power_show_in_creation.htm">What does "Let the earth bring forth living creatures" reveal about God's power?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Genesis_1_24_to_1_26_creation_of_man.htm">How does Genesis 1:24 connect to the creation of man in Genesis 1:26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_God_s_creation_order_to_life.htm">How can we apply the concept of God's order in creation to our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_24_God_s_provision_for_life.htm">What does Genesis 1:24 teach about God's provision for the earth's inhabitants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_24_vs_species_evolution.htm">How does Genesis 1:24 align with scientific understanding of species development?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Is_Genesis_1_24_literal_or_metaphorical.htm">Does Genesis 1:24 suggest a literal or metaphorical interpretation of creation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Animal_kinds_vs_modern_taxonomy.htm">How do animals "according to their kinds" relate to modern taxonomy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_animal_testing.htm">What is the Bible's stance on animal testing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/do_animals_show_homosexual_behavior.htm">Do animals display homosexual behavior?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_do_christians_handle_pet_loss.htm">How do Christians cope with losing a pet?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_micro-_and_macroevolution_differ.htm">How do microevolution and macroevolution differ?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Genesis 1:24 Mean</div><b>And God said</b><p>&#8226;

The verse showcases the authority of God&#8217;s word, the intentional design of living systems, and the dependability of divine promises: what He says, happens&#8212;every time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Let the earth bring forth.</span>--Neither this, nor the corresponding phrase in <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm" title="And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.">Genesis 1:20</a>, necessarily imply spontaneous generation, though such is its literal meaning. It need mean no more than that land animals, produced on the dry ground, were now to follow upon those produced in the waters. However produced, we believe that the sole active power was the creative will of God, but of His <span class= "ital">modus operandi </span>we know nothing.<p>On this sixth creative day there are four words of power. By the first, the higher animals are summoned into being; by the second, man; the third provides for the continuance and increase of the beings which God had created; the fourth assigns the vegetable world both to man and animals as food.<p>The creation of man is thus made a distinct act; for though created on the sixth day, because he is a land animal, yet it is in the latter part of the day, and after a pause of contemplation and counsel. The reason for this, we venture to affirm, is that in man's creation we have a far greater advance in the work of the Almighty than at any previous stage. For up to this time all has been <span class= "ital">law, </span>and the highest point reached was <span class= "ital">instinct; </span>we have now freedom, reason, intellect, speech. The evolutionist may give us many an interesting theory about the upgrowth of man's physical nature, but the introduction of this moral and mental freedom places as wide a chasm in his way as the first introduction of vegetable, and then of animal life.<p><span class= "bld">The living creature, </span>or rather, <span class= "ital">the creature that lives by breathing, </span>is divided into three classes. The first is <span class= "ital">"</span>behemah," <span class= "ital">cattle: </span>literally, the <span class= "ital">dumb </span>brute, but especially used of the larger ruminants, which were soon domesticated, and became man's speechless servants. Next comes the "creeping thing," or rather, <span class= "ital">moving thing, </span>from a verb translated <span class= "ital">moveth </span>in <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>. It probably signifies the whole multitude of small animals, and not reptiles particularly. For strictly the word refers rather to their number than to their means of locomotion, and means a <span class= "ital">swarm. </span>The third class is the "beast of the earth," the wild animals that roam over a large extent of country, including the carnivora. But as a vegetable diet is expressly assigned in <a href="/genesis/1-30.htm" title="And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creeps on the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.">Genesis 1:30</a> to the "beast of the earth," while the evidence of the rocks proves that even on the fifth day the saurians fed upon fish and upon one another, the record seems to point out a closer relation between man and the graminivora than with these fierce denizens of the forest. The narrative of the flood proves conclusively that there were no carnivora in the ark; and immediately afterwards beasts that kill men were ordered to be destroyed (<a href="/context/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5-6</a>). It is plain that from the first these beasts lay outside the covenant. But as early as the fourth century, Titus, Bishop of Bostra, in his treatise against the <span class= "ital">Manichees, </span>showed, on other than geological grounds, that the carnivora existed before the fall, and that there was nothing inconsistent with God's wisdom or love in their feeding upon other animals. In spite of their presence, all was good. The evidence of geology proves that in the age when the carnivora were most abundant, the graminivora were represented by species of enormous size, and that they flourished in multitudes far surpassing anything that exists in the present day. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="accented">Day</span> <span class="accented">six</span>. Like day three, this is distinguished by a double creative act, the production of the higher or land animals and the creation of man, of the latter of which it is perhaps permissible to see a mute prediction in the vegetation which closed the first half of the creative week. <span class="cmt_word">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind</span>. In these words the land animals are generically characterized as <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, or animated beings; in the terms which follow they are subdivided into three well-defined species or classes. <span class="cmt_word">Cattle</span>. <span class="accented">Behemah</span>; literally, the dumb animal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the larger grass-eating quadrupeds. <span class="cmt_word">And creeping thing.</span> <span class="accented">Remes</span>; the moving animal, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the smaller animals that move either without feet or with feet that are scarcely perceptible, such as worms, insects, reptiles.

In these three comprehensive orders was the earth commanded to produce its occupants; which, however, no more implied that the animals were to be developed from the soil than were the finny tribes generated by the sea. Simply in obedience to the Divine call, and as the product of creative energy, they were to spring from the plastic dust as being essentially earth-born creatures. <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>. Modern evolutionists believe they can conceive - they have never yet been able to demonstrate - the <span class="accented">modus operandi</span> of the supreme Artificer in the execution of this part of the sixth day's work.
