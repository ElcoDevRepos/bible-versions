Judah's question reflects a customary practice of providing a tangible item as a security deposit. This practice is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a>, which advises taking a garment as a pledge. The request for a pledge indicates a transactional nature to the encounter, highlighting the moral and ethical complexities in Judah's actions.<p><b>She answered, &#8220;Your seal and your cord, and the staff in your hand.&#8221;</b><br>The seal, cord, and staff were personal items that signified identity and authority. The seal, often a signet ring or cylinder, was used to imprint a unique mark on clay or wax, serving as a signature. The cord likely refers to the string or chain that held the seal. The staff was a symbol of leadership and personal identity, often carved with unique markings. These items were unmistakably linked to Judah, making them significant in the narrative as they later serve as evidence of his actions. This request for personal items underscores the seriousness of the pledge and foreshadows their role in revealing Judah's identity.<p><b>So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.</b><br>Judah's compliance in giving these items shows his willingness to fulfill the transaction, despite the potential risks. The act of sleeping with Tamar, his daughter-in-law, was against the Levitical laws that would later be established (<a href="/leviticus/18-15.htm">Leviticus 18:15</a>). This encounter results in Tamar's pregnancy, which is crucial for the continuation of Judah's lineage. The birth of Perez and Zerah from this union is significant, as Perez becomes an ancestor of King David and, ultimately, Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3</a>). This event illustrates God's sovereignty in using flawed human actions to fulfill His divine purposes, highlighting themes of redemption and grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah is a central figure in this account.

He treats the moment like a routine business deal, revealing how far he has drifted from covenant priorities (<a href="/genesis/38-16.htm">Genesis 38:16&#8211;17</a>). Scripture later codifies the concept of collateral: &#8220;If you take your neighbor&#8217;s cloak as collateral, return it to him by sunset&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26</a>).

Solomon later warns, &#8220;Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>).

The New Testament echoes, &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>).

Yet through Tamar&#8217;s boldness and God&#8217;s providence, the resulting child advances the Messianic line. The verse stands as a sober warning against careless sin and a triumphant reminder that God&#8217;s redemptive purposes remain unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Thy bracelets.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">thy cord. </span>The art of engraving was probably not advanced enough among these nomads to permit them to engrave gems small enough to wear in a ring. Judah evidently suspended his signet round his neck by a cord; and this custom still exists among the Arabs, of whom some wear signet rings, while others hang them round their necks. Probably each man of distinction had his emblem, and in Genesis 49 Jacob seems to refer to them. Thus Judah's emblem was a lion, Zebulun's a ship, Issachar's an ass, &c.<p><span class= "bld">Thy staff.</span>--The staff in ancient times was elaborately adorned. Herodotus (i. 195) describes the staves carried by the Babylonians, as having on them carvings of fruit, or of some flower or bird; and Homer perpetually makes mention of the "sceptres," that is, walking-sticks, of the kings, as carved so magnificently as to be worthy of being ascribed to Hephaestus, and handed down as emblems of authority from father to son. (See <span class= "ital">Iliad, ii.</span> 101-107.) It is from these staves that the sceptres of kings, and the batons of field-marshals, &c, are derived.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What pledge shall I give thee?

Among the ancient Babylonians it was customary for every one to wear such a ring (Herod., 1:195); and modern Arabians in towns wear a seal-ring on the finger, or fastened by a cord round the neck, the impression of which serves as a signature (Robinson, 1:52). The seals and signets that have been brought to light by the excavations in Assyria and Babylon (Layard, 'Nin. and Bab.,' 152-159, 602-608) are of various forms and materials. They show the art of engraving to have been of great antiquity; but whether Judah's signet was marked with alphabetical characters cannot be determined, though it may have been, since alphabetical writing was as old at least as the time of Abraham (vide Keil, 'Introd.,' Part I. sect. 1. <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. &sect; 4) - <span class="cmt_word">and thy bracelets</span> (rather, thy chain, <span class="accented">pithil</span>, ut supra), <span class="cmt_word">and thy staff</span> (the <span class="accented">mateh</span>, or rod, was so called from the idea of stretching out, the root being <span class="accented">natah</span>, to stretch out or extend) <span class="cmt_word">that is in thine hand</span>. This too every Baby-Ionian carried (Herod., 1:195). "It was necessarily adorned with some device carved upon it, and consisting in a flower or a fruit, a bird, or some other animal" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/38-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pledge</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
