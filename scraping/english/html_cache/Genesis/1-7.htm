The "expanse" refers to the sky or firmament, a concept understood in ancient Near Eastern cosmology as a solid dome separating the earthly realm from the heavenly waters. This act of creation demonstrates God's orderliness, as He structures the universe with purpose and precision. The expanse is a testament to God's ability to bring order out of chaos, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a>, where God sets boundaries for the sea.<p><b>and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above.</b><br>The separation of waters is a significant act, symbolizing the establishment of boundaries within creation. The "waters beneath" refer to the seas and oceans, while the "waters above" are often interpreted as the atmospheric waters, possibly clouds or the celestial waters believed to exist beyond the firmament. This separation is a recurring theme in biblical literature, highlighting God's control over the natural world, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2-3</a>, where God stretches out the heavens like a tent. The act of separation also prefigures the division between the holy and the profane, a concept further developed in the Levitical laws.<p><b>And it was so.</b><br>This phrase underscores the effectiveness and authority of God's word. When God speaks, His will is accomplished without delay or hindrance. This immediate fulfillment of God's command is a pattern seen throughout the creation narrative, reinforcing the idea that God's word is powerful and creative. The phrase also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and reliability, as His decrees are always fulfilled, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word does not return void but accomplishes His purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is actively involved in the formation of the universe.

Similar creative verbs appear in <a href="/genesis/1-16.htm">Genesis 1:16</a> where He &#8220;made the two great lights,&#8221; underscoring direct craftsmanship.<p>- <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a> adds, &#8220;By the word of the LORD the heavens were made,&#8221; showing that the expanse (or sky) springs from His spoken command&#8212;no intermediary forces, no chance processes.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a> echoes the same truth: &#8220;He founded the earth by His power&#8230; stretched out the heavens by His wisdom.&#8221; The cosmos is intentional, orderly, and God-centered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Purposeful Separation: &#8220;and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above.&#8221;</b><p>- In creating the sky, God divides waters into two distinct realms. The lower waters become seas, rivers, and groundwater (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9</a>). The upper waters refer to the moisture stored above the sky, the source of rain (<a href="/psalms/148-4.htm">Psalm 148:4</a>: &#8220;Praise Him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the skies&#8221;).<p>- This separation reveals His sustaining care: He preserves life by holding some waters aloft and restraining others below, a balance later displayed when He releases the upper waters in the Flood (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>).<p>- <a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5</a> recalls that &#8220;the earth was formed out of water and by water,&#8221; affirming that the watery division was not mythic imagery but a real, historical act central to earth&#8217;s formation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Divine Confirmation: &#8220;And it was so.&#8221;</b><p>- These four words stamp God&#8217;s authority on reality.

In each step of the narrative it is ever man that is in view; and even the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere is indispensable for the health and comfort of the human body, and for the keeping of all things in their place on earth. (See Note, <a href="/genesis/1-8.htm" title="And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.">Genesis 1:8</a>.) And in this secondary sense it may still rightly be called the firmament.<p><span class= "bld">The waters which were under the firmament . . . the waters which were above the firmament.</span>--While this is a popular description of what we daily see--namely, masses of running water congregated upon earth's surface, and above a cloudland, into which the waters rise and float--it is not contrary to, but in accordance with, science. The atmosphere is the receptacle of the waters evaporated from the earth and ocean, and by means of electrical action it keeps these aqueous particles in a state of repulsion, and forms clouds, which the winds carry in their bosom. So full of thoughtful contrivance and arrangement are the laws by which rain is formed and the earth watered, that they are constantly referred to in the Bible as the chief natural proof of God's wisdom and goodness. (See <a href="/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>.) Moreover, were there not an open expanse next the earth, it would be wrapped in a perpetual mist, unvisited by sunshine. and the result would be such as is described in <a href="/genesis/2-5.htm" title="And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.">Genesis 2:5</a>, that man could not exist on earth to till the ground. The use, however, of popular language and ideas is confessedly the method of Holy Scripture, and we must not force upon the writer knowledge which man was to gain for himself. Even if the writer supposed that the rains were poured down from an upper reservoir, it would be no more an argument against his being inspired than St. Mark's expression, "The sun did set" (<a href="/mark/1-32.htm" title="And at even, when the sun did set, they brought to him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.">Mark 1:32</a>), disproves the inspiration of the Gospels. For the attainment of all such knowledge God has provided another way.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God made the firmament</span>. How the present atmosphere was evolved from the chaotic mass of waters the Mosaic narrative does not reveal. The primary intention of that record being not to teach science, but to discover religious truth, the thing of paramount importance to be communicated was that the firmament was of God's construction. This, of course, does not prevent us from believing that the elimination of those gases (twenty-one parts of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen, with a small proportion of carbonic acid gas and aqueous vapor) which compose our atmosphere was not effected by natural means; and how far it may have been assisted by the action of the light upon the condensing mass of the globe is a problem in the solution of which science may legitimately take an interest. <span class="cmt_word">And divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament</span>. The <span class="accented">upper</span> waters are not the material of the stars (Delitzsch, Wordsworth), although Jupiter is of the same density as water, and Saturn only half its density; but the waters floating about in the higher spaces of the air. The under waters are not the lower atmospheric vapors, but the oceanic and terrestrial waters. How the waters are collected in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, Scripture, no less than science, explains to be by means of evaporation (<a href="/genesis/2-6.htm">Genesis 2:6</a>; <a href="/job/36-27.htm">Job 36:27</a>; <a href="/job/37-16.htm">Job 37:16</a>). These latter passages suggest that the clouds are balanced, suspended, upheld by the buoyancy of the air in exact accordance with scientific principles. <span class="cmt_word">And it was so</span>. Six times these words occur in the creation record. Sublimely suggestive of the resistless energy of the Divine word, which speaks, and it is done, commands, and it standeth fast, they likewise remind us of the sweet submissiveness of the creature to the all-wise Creator's will, and, perhaps, are designed as well to intimate the fixed and permanent character of those arrangements to which they are attached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
