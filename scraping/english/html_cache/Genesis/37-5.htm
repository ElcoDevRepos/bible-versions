Joseph's dreams are prophetic, foreshadowing his future rise to power and the eventual bowing of his family before him. Dreams were significant in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often seen as messages from the divine. Joseph's ability to interpret dreams later becomes a key element in his life, paralleling the role of Daniel in the Babylonian court.<p><b>and when he told it to his brothers</b><br>Joseph's decision to share his dream with his brothers reflects his youthful naivety and perhaps a lack of awareness of their growing animosity. In the cultural context, sharing such a dream could be seen as boastful, especially given the implications of his family bowing to him. This act sets the stage for the unfolding family dynamics and tension.<p><b>they hated him even more</b><br>The brothers' hatred is compounded by Joseph's favored status with their father, Jacob, and the special coat he received, symbolizing his father's preference. This hatred is a critical element in the narrative, leading to their betrayal of Joseph. The theme of sibling rivalry is prevalent in Genesis, echoing earlier stories such as Cain and Abel, and Jacob and Esau. This animosity also serves as a backdrop for the eventual reconciliation and redemption narrative, which is a type of Christ's forgiveness and reconciliation with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, known for his coat of many colors and his prophetic dreams.

In each case the dream comes from God, carries authority, and demands faith.<p>&#8226; A personal encounter: God bypassed the family hierarchy and spoke directly to Joseph, echoing His earlier approach to Jacob at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophetic clarity: The dream&#8217;s meaning proved so unmistakable that even the brothers grasped its implication (<a href="/genesis/37-8.htm">Genesis 37:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty: The revelation affirms <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>&#8212;God is already weaving adversity and favor into a single redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when he told it to his brothers</b><p>Joseph shared the dream openly, perhaps with youthful candor.

In the life of Joseph they form the turning point in his history, and it is to be noticed that while revelations were frequently made to Jacob, we have henceforward no record of any such direct communication from God to man until the time of Moses. The utmost granted to Joseph was to dream dreams; and after this the children of Israel in Egypt were left entirely to natural laws and influences. (Comp.
