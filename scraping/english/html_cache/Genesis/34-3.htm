The term "soul" implies a profound connection, which in biblical terms often denotes the seat of emotions and desires. Dinah, as the daughter of Jacob, is part of the covenant family, which adds a layer of complexity to the narrative. Jacob, also known as Israel, is a patriarch whose descendants are central to God's promises. The mention of Dinah highlights the vulnerability of women in ancient Near Eastern societies, where family honor and social standing were closely tied to the actions of female members.<p><b>He loved the young girl</b><br>The use of "loved" here is significant, as it suggests a genuine affection, albeit in a context that is troubling due to the preceding events of the chapter. This love is complicated by the cultural and historical setting, where marriages were often arranged and love was not always the primary factor. The term "young girl" emphasizes Dinah's youth and innocence, which contrasts with the actions taken against her. This phrase can be compared to other biblical instances where love is professed, such as Jacob's love for Rachel, highlighting the complexities and sometimes tragic nature of love in biblical narratives.<p><b>and spoke to her tenderly.</b><br>Speaking tenderly suggests an attempt to comfort or win favor, indicating a desire for reconciliation or acceptance. This phrase can be seen as an attempt to mitigate the harshness of previous actions, reflecting a common biblical theme of seeking forgiveness or restoration. The act of speaking tenderly is reminiscent of other biblical figures who use gentle words to convey love or seek peace, such as Boaz with Ruth. It also contrasts with the often harsh realities of ancient life, where power dynamics and social structures could overshadow personal relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>The daughter of Jacob and Leah, Dinah is the central female figure in this account.

Touching his family carries weighty implications.<p>&#8226; By singling out her lineage, the text reminds us that Dinah belongs to the chosen household&#8212;a people called to remain distinct from Canaanite practices (<a href="/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The family loyalty of Jacob&#8217;s sons will soon erupt (<a href="/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7, 25</a>-26), demonstrating how seriously they regard any offense to their sister and, by extension, to the covenant line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He loved the young girl</b><p>&#8220;He loved the young girl&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture records the word &#8220;loved,&#8221; but the surrounding context exposes a love tainted by prior sin. Compare Amnon&#8217;s abusive &#8220;love&#8221; for Tamar that quickly turned to hatred (<a href="/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The Bible distinguishes true, self-giving love (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>) from self-focused passion. Shechem&#8217;s actions reveal which kind is dominant.<p>&#8226; Even so, the statement reminds us that human emotions&#8212;even when flawed&#8212;can prompt attempts at restitution, as Shechem soon seeks marriage and offers compensation (<a href="/genesis/34-11.htm">Genesis 34:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spoke to her tenderly</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and spoke to her tenderly&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Tenderly&#8221; translates literally &#8220;to the heart,&#8221; a phrase used of comforting words (<a href="/ruth/2-13.htm">Ruth 2:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Gentle speech can be genuine or manipulative; <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> praises soft words, while <a href="/judges/16-4.htm">Judges 16:4-15</a> shows Delilah&#8217;s coaxing tone masking betrayal.<p>&#8226; In Shechem&#8217;s case, kind words follow a grievous wrong. They illustrate how people often seek to soothe consequences without true repentance&#8212;a pattern Scripture repeatedly warns against (<a href="/jeremiah/8-11.htm">Jeremiah 8:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-3.htm">Genesis 34:3</a> records Shechem&#8217;s powerful attraction, familial context, professed love, and gentle words toward Dinah. The verse highlights the complexity of fallen human desire: strong feelings can coexist with grave wrongdoing. By framing Dinah as &#8220;the daughter of Jacob,&#8221; the text stresses covenant holiness and foreshadows the protective, if violent, response of her brothers. True love aligns with God&#8217;s standards of purity and self-sacrifice; anything less, no matter how tender the speech, falls short of the righteousness God requires.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his soul clave</span> (<span class="accented">vide infra</span> on ver. 8) <span class="cmt_word">unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob</span>, - it was in some degree an extenuation of the wickedness of Shechem that he did not cast off the victim of his violence and lust, but continued to regard her with affection - <span class="cmt_word">and he loved the damsel</span>, - on the use of <span class="accented">na'ar</span> for a youth of either sex <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14</a> - <span class="cmt_word">and spake kindly unto the damsel</span> - literally, spoke <span class="accented">to the heart of the damsel</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> addressed to her such words as were agreeable to her inclinations (cf. on the import of the phrase <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>;
