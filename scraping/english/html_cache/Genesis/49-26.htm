In biblical context, mountains often symbolize strength, stability, and permanence. The "ancient mountains" could refer to the longstanding and unchanging nature of God's promises and blessings. Jacob's blessings are portrayed as even greater than these, emphasizing their divine origin and significance. This reflects the patriarchal tradition where blessings are passed down and are seen as powerful and prophetic, as seen in the blessings given by Isaac to Jacob and Esau in <a href="/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>.<p><b>and the bounty of the everlasting hills.</b><br>The "everlasting hills" further emphasize the eternal and abundant nature of the blessings. Hills and mountains in the ancient Near East were often associated with fertility and divine presence. The use of "everlasting" suggests a connection to God's eternal covenant with His people, reminiscent of the promises made to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>. This phrase underscores the idea that Joseph's blessings are not only abundant but also enduring, reflecting God's unchanging faithfulness.<p><b>May they rest on the head of Joseph,</b><br>Joseph, as the recipient of these blessings, is highlighted as a key figure in the narrative of Israel. His life story, marked by trials and triumphs, exemplifies God's providence and favor. The imagery of blessings resting on his head signifies honor and leadership, aligning with his role as a savior figure for his family during the famine (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate source of blessing and salvation for humanity.<p><b>on the brow of the prince of his brothers.</b><br>Joseph is referred to as the "prince of his brothers," indicating his preeminence and leadership among the tribes of Israel. This title reflects his elevated status, both in Egypt and within his family, as seen in <a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3-4</a> and <a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-44</a>. The term "prince" also foreshadows the future leadership roles of the tribes of Israel, with Joseph's descendants, Ephraim and Manasseh, playing significant roles in the history of Israel. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's chosen leaders, ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, who leads and blesses His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is giving his final blessings to his sons in this chapter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's favored son, who receives a special blessing that surpasses those given to his brothers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_mountains_and_everlasting_hills.htm">Ancient Mountains and Everlasting Hills</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of enduring strength and stability, used to describe the magnitude of the blessings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers_of_joseph.htm">Brothers of Joseph</a></b><br>The other sons of Jacob, who receive their own blessings and prophecies in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph rose to power and where Jacob's family resided during the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_blessing.htm">The Power of Blessing</a></b><br>Jacob's blessing over Joseph highlights the power and importance of speaking blessings over others.

The promise covers spiritual favor, material abundance, and honored leadership. History confirms it, and the unchanging character of God guarantees it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/49.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">The blessings of thy father.</span>--As the passage now stands, it means that the blessings which Jacob bestows upon Joseph are greater than those which he had himself received from his ancestors, Abraham and Isaac. This was scarcely the case, as the chief spiritual blessing was bestowed upon Judah, while for Joseph there was only earthly prosperity. For this reason most modern commentators adopt the reading of the Samaritan Pentateuch, supported by the Samaritan Targum and the LXX., "The blessings of thy father are mightier than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the desire (or beauty) of the everlasting hills." Not only is the parallelism of the poetry thus preserved, but the rendering is easy and natural, while the other translation is full of difficulties, especially as to the words, "my progenitors," and "the utmost bound." The sense thus given to them cannot be obtained by any ordinary philological process.<p><span class= "bld">Him that was separate from his brethren.</span>--This scarcely gives the force of the verb, which means, <span class= "ital">set apart, consecrated. </span>Hence the Vulg. renders "Nazarite," the Hebrew word being <span class= "ital">nezir. </span>The Syriac and Samaritan Targum translate, "him that is the crown of his brethren;" and the LXX., "him who was the leader of his brethren." Many see in this an allusion to the sovereignty over the ten tribes being finally attained to by Ephraim, but probably the meaning is that Joseph was the noblest and highest in rank among Jacob's children.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/49-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The blessings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bir&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1293.htm">Strong's 1293: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benediction, prosperity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your father</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
