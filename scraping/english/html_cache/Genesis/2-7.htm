The use of "LORD God" combines the covenant name Yahweh with Elohim, emphasizing both His personal and powerful nature. The act of forming man from dust signifies humility and mortality, as dust is a common and lowly substance. This creation account contrasts with other ancient Near Eastern myths where humans are often created from divine blood or other materials. The phrase also connects to <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where God tells Adam, "for dust you are and to dust you will return," underscoring human mortality. The imagery of God as a potter shaping clay is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, where God is described as the potter and humans as the clay.<p><b>and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils</b><br>This action signifies the impartation of life directly from God, indicating a personal and life-giving relationship between the Creator and humanity. The "breath of life" is a unique divine gift, setting humans apart from other creatures. This breath is not merely physical life but also spiritual, as seen in <a href="/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a>, "The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life." The act of breathing into the nostrils suggests intimacy and care, akin to resuscitation, and foreshadows the giving of the Holy Spirit in <a href="/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>, where Jesus breathes on His disciples and says, "Receive the Holy Spirit."<p><b>and the man became a living being</b><br>This phrase marks the transition from lifeless form to a living, conscious being. The Hebrew word for "living being" is nephesh, often translated as "soul," indicating a complete, living person with physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions. This concept of nephesh is foundational for understanding human nature in the Bible, as it encompasses the whole person. The creation of man as a living being reflects the image of God, as stated in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, and establishes humanity's unique role in creation. This living being is capable of relationship with God, moral decision-making, and stewardship of the earth, as outlined in the subsequent verses of Genesis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_god.htm">The LORD God</a></b><br>The Creator, referred to as "Yahweh Elohim" in Hebrew, emphasizing both His covenant relationship and His supreme power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>The first human, Adam, created uniquely by God from the dust, signifying both humility and divine intention.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dust_of_the_ground.htm">Dust of the Ground</a></b><br>Represents the material substance from which God formed man, highlighting human frailty and connection to the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/breath_of_life.htm">Breath of Life</a></b><br>The divine breath, "neshamah" in Hebrew, indicating the life-giving spirit that distinguishes humans from other creatures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_being.htm">Living Being</a></b><br>The result of God's creative act, "nephesh chayah" in Hebrew, meaning a living soul, emphasizing the holistic nature of human life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_divine_origin_of_life.htm">The Divine Origin of Life</a></b><br>Recognize that human life is a direct creation of God, instilling inherent value and purpose.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humanity's_humble_beginnings.htm">Humanity's Humble Beginnings</a></b><br>Understand our humble origins from dust, fostering humility and gratitude towards God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_breath_of_god.htm">The Breath of God</a></b><br>Appreciate the life-giving breath of God, which sustains us and calls us to live in relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holistic_nature_of_humanity.htm">The Holistic Nature of Humanity</a></b><br>Embrace the unity of body and spirit, encouraging a balanced approach to spiritual and physical well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Acknowledge our dependence on God for life and sustenance, leading to a life of faith and trust.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_2_7_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 2:7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_7_God_s_role_in_human_creation.htm">How does Genesis 2:7 emphasize God's role in creating human life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_breathed_into_reveal_about_life.htm">What does "breathed into his nostrils" reveal about the nature of life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_7_and_God_s_image_link.htm">How does Genesis 2:7 connect to the concept of humans made in God's image?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_7_s_link_to_life_s_sanctity.htm">How can understanding Genesis 2:7 deepen our appreciation for the sanctity of life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_daily_as_Creator.htm">In what ways can we honor God as our Creator in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_7_vs_science_on_human_origins.htm">How does Genesis 2:7 align with scientific understanding of human origins?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_does_breath_of_life_mean_for_soul.htm">What does "breath of life" in Genesis 2:7 signify about the soul?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_2_7_s_impact_on_human_dignity.htm">How does Genesis 2:7 influence the concept of human dignity and value?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/are_souls_created_or_pre-existing.htm">Are souls created at conception or pre-existing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_death.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_christians_sell_their_souls.htm">Can Christians sell their souls to the devil?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/can_the_bible_aid_suicidal_thoughts.htm">Can the Bible help someone considering suicide?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Genesis 2:7 Mean</div><b>Then the LORD God</b><p>&#8220;Then the LORD God&#8230;&#8221;

So in <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm" title="And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.">Genesis 2:19</a> Jehovah forms the animals, and in <a href="/genesis/2-8.htm" title="And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.">Genesis 2:8</a> He plants a garden. As Elohim is almighty power, so Jehovah is wisdom and skill, and His works are full of contrivance and design. As regards man's body, Jehovah forms it <span class= "ital">dust from the ground: </span>the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>or fruitful arable soil, so called from Adam, for whose use it was specially fitted, and by whom it was first tilled. But the main intention of the words is to point out man's feebleness. He is made not from the rocks, nor from ores of metal, but from the light, shifting particles of the surface, blown about by every wind. Yet, frail as is man's body, God--<p><span class= "bld">. . . breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span>--The life came not as the result of man's bodily organisation, nor as derived by evolution from any other animal, but as a gift direct from God.<p><span class= "bld">And man became a living soul.</span>--The word translated "soul" contains no idea of a spiritual existence. For in <a href="/genesis/1-20.htm" title="And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.">Genesis 1:20</a>, "creature that hath life," and in <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>, "the living creature," are literally, <span class= "ital">living soul. </span>Really the word refers to the natural life of animals and men, maintained by breathing, or in some way extracting oxygen from the atmospheric air. And whatever superiority over other animals may be possessed by man comes from the manner in which this living breath was bestowed upon him, and not from his being "a living soul;" for that is common to all alike.<p>The whole of this second narrative is pre-eminently anthropomorphic. In the previous history Elohim commands, and it is done. Here He forms, and builds, and plants, and breathes into His work, and is the companion and friend of the creature He has made. It thus sets before us the love and tenderness of Jehovah, who provides for man a home, fashions for him a wife to be his partner and helpmate, rejoices in his intellect, and brings the lower world to him to see what he will call them, and even after the fall provides the poor outcasts with clothing. It is a picture fitted for the infancy of mankind, and speaking the language of primaeval simplicity. But its lesson is for all times. For it proclaims the love of God to man, his special pre-eminence in the scale of being, and that Elohim, the Almighty Creator, is Jehovah-Elohim, the friend and counsellor of the creature whom He has endowed with reason and free-will. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">formed man of the dust of the ground.</span> Literally, dust from the ground. Here, again, Bleek, Kalisch, and the theologians of their school discover contrariety between this account of man's creation and that which has been given in the preceding chapter. <span class="accented">In that</span> man is represented as having been created by the Divine word, in the Divine image, and male and female simultaneously; whereas <span class="accented">in this</span> his creation is exhibited as a painful process of elaboration from the clay by the hand of God, who works it like a potter (<span class="accented">asah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), and, after having first constructed man, by a subsequent operation forms woman. But the first account does not assert that Adam and Eve were created together, and gives no details of the formation of either. These are supplied by the present narrative, which, beginning with the construction of his body from the fine dust of the ground, designedly represents it as an evolution or development of the material universe, and ends by setting it before us as animated by the breath of God, reserving for later treatment the mode of Eve's production, when the circumstances that led to it have been described. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (the Lord God) <span class="cmt_word">breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span> Literally, the breath of lives. "The formation of man from the dust and the breathing of the breath of life must not be understood in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from the dust" (still less does it admit of the idea that man's physical nature was evolved from the lower animals), "and then, by breathing his breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. By an act of Divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the Divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">And man became a</span> <span class="cmt_word">living soul</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>, in <a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, 80, is employed to designate the lower animals. Describing a being animated by a <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> or life principle, it does not necessarily imply that the basis of the life principle in man and the inferior animals is the same. The distinction between the two appears from the difference in the mode of their creations. The beasts arose at the almighty fiat completed beings, every one a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>. "The origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life with which all matter was filled at the beginning by the Spirit of God" (Delitzsch). Man received his life from a distinct act of Divine inbreathing; certainly not an in-breathing of atmospheric air, but an inflatus from the Ruach Elohim, or Spirit of God, a communication from the whole personality of the Godhead. In effect man was thereby constituted a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, like the lower animals; but in him the life principle conferred a personality which was wanting in them. Thus there is no real contradiction, scarcely even an "<span class="accented">apparent</span> dissonance," between the two accounts of man's creation.
