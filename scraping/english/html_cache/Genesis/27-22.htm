This act of coming close symbolizes both physical proximity and the moral distance Jacob is willing to traverse to obtain the blessing. In biblical narratives, physical closeness often precedes significant events or revelations, as seen when God draws near to His people. The act of drawing near can also be seen as a type of Christ, who draws near to humanity to fulfill His mission.<p><b>who touched him</b><br>Isaac's reliance on touch rather than sight is due to his old age and failing eyesight, which is mentioned earlier in the chapter. This reliance on touch is a critical element in the deception, as Jacob and Rebekah exploit Isaac's sensory limitations. The act of touching is also a recurring biblical theme, often associated with blessing, healing, or impartation, as seen in the laying on of hands in the New Testament.<p><b>and said, &#8220;The voice is the voice of Jacob,</b><br>Isaac's discernment through hearing highlights the tension between appearance and reality. The voice of Jacob represents his true identity, which contrasts with the deception he is enacting. This moment foreshadows the future struggles Jacob will face due to his deceit, as well as the importance of truth and integrity in relationships. The voice also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's voice guiding His people, as seen in the prophets and ultimately in Jesus, the Word made flesh.<p><b>but the hands are the hands of Esau.&#8221;</b><br>The hands of Esau, covered with goat skins, symbolize the successful deception of Isaac. This physical disguise represents the lengths to which Jacob and Rebekah go to secure the blessing. The hands, often associated with action and work, contrast with the voice, which is linked to identity and truth. This duality reflects the inner conflict within Jacob and foreshadows his later transformation after wrestling with God. The hands also connect to the biblical theme of blessing, as Esau's hands were those of a skilled hunter, and Jacob's hands would later become those of a patriarch.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is attempting to deceive his father into giving him the blessing meant for his brother Esau.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The aging and blind patriarch, father of Esau and Jacob, who is preparing to bestow his blessing upon his firstborn son.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac, known for his hunting skills and rugged nature, who is the rightful recipient of Isaac's blessing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The mother of Jacob and Esau, who orchestrates the deception to ensure Jacob receives the blessing.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent.htm">The Tent</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Isaac resides and where the blessing is to be given.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Jacob's actions remind us of the deceitfulness of sin.

What comes out of the mouth exposes the person behind the mask.<p>&#8226; Even so, Isaac suppresses what his ears tell him, demonstrating how easily we silence truth when other senses&#8212;or desires&#8212;push a different narrative (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the hands are the hands of Esau</b><p>&#8226; Goat-skin coverings (<a href="/genesis/27-16.htm">Genesis 27:16</a>) mimic Esau&#8217;s rough exterior, persuading Isaac that he is touching his firstborn.<p>&#8226; The contrast between voice and hands pictures the divided life: outward works can appear convincing while the inner man remains unchanged (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God lets the tactile evidence win because His sovereign plan is not threatened by human deception; He weaves even sin into redemption history (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/27-22.htm">Genesis 27:22</a> captures the tension between appearance and reality. Isaac&#8217;s senses clash&#8212;ears hear Jacob, hands feel Esau&#8212;showing the limits of human discernment. Yet behind the confusion stands the unwavering purpose of God: the covenant blessing must pass to Jacob. The verse warns us against trusting surface indicators while it reassures us that God&#8217;s promises stand firm, even when fulfilled through flawed people and imperfect circumstances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (with a boldness worthy of a better cause) <span class="cmt_word">went near unto Isaac his father;</span> <span class="cmt_word">and he</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

It is hard to credit that Isaac either did not believe in the Divine announcement which had indicated Jacob as the heir of the promise, or that, believing it, he deliberately allowed paternal partiality to interfere with, and even endeavor to reverse, the will of Heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1435;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came close</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1447;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
