In the ancient Near East, wealth was often measured by one's possessions, particularly livestock, which were essential for survival and economic stability. Abram's wealth is a testament to God's faithfulness, as He promised to make Abram a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). This wealth also sets the stage for future events, such as Abram's ability to rescue Lot and his interactions with other nations and leaders.<p><b>in livestock</b><br>Livestock was a primary measure of wealth in the ancient world, providing food, clothing, and trade opportunities. Abram's wealth in livestock indicates his significant status and influence. This also foreshadows the importance of livestock in the sacrificial system established later in the Mosaic Law, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>and silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold were valuable commodities in the ancient world, used for trade, ornamentation, and as a store of wealth. Abram's possession of these precious metals highlights his prosperity and God's provision. This wealth would later play a role in the economic interactions between Abram's descendants and other nations.
