The wheat harvest was a time of gathering and celebration, often associated with the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), which later became Pentecost in the Christian tradition. This context highlights the agrarian lifestyle of the patriarchs and sets the stage for the events that follow.<p><b>Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field</b><br>Reuben, the firstborn son of Leah and Jacob, plays a pivotal role in this narrative. The mandrake plant, known for its human-like root shape, was believed in ancient cultures to possess fertility-enhancing properties. This belief is reflected in the Hebrew term "dudaim," which is associated with love and fertility. The finding of mandrakes by Reuben introduces a theme of desire and competition between Leah and Rachel, Jacob's wives.<p><b>When he brought them to his mother</b><br>Reuben's action of bringing the mandrakes to Leah indicates his loyalty and affection towards his mother. This gesture also underscores the family dynamics and the ongoing rivalry between Leah and Rachel for Jacob's affection and the blessing of children. The mandrakes become a symbol of hope for Leah, who desires to gain favor and bear more children.<p><b>Rachel begged Leah</b><br>Rachel's plea to Leah reveals her desperation and longing for children, as she had not yet borne any sons for Jacob at this point. This moment of vulnerability highlights the intense personal and familial struggles within Jacob's household. Rachel's request also reflects the cultural importance placed on childbearing and the status it conferred upon women in ancient times.<p><b>&#8220;Please give me some of your son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221;</b><br>Rachel's request for the mandrakes signifies her belief in their supposed fertility benefits. This interaction between Rachel and Leah is a microcosm of their ongoing rivalry and the complex relationships within the family. The mandrakes serve as a bargaining tool, leading to further negotiations between the sisters. This narrative foreshadows the eventual birth of more children to both Leah and Rachel, continuing the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah.

In this household, food is plentiful, but Rachel&#8217;s womb is still empty (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>). The contrast heightens the emotional tension.<p>&#8226; The setting underscores God&#8217;s overarching sovereignty: just as wheat ripens on schedule, so His purposes for each family member will reach maturity at the appointed time (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field</b><p>&#8220;Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Reuben, Leah&#8217;s firstborn (<a href="/genesis/29-32.htm">Genesis 29:32</a>), is likely a young boy eager to help.

Scripture records the fact of this belief without endorsing superstition, reminding us that God alone opens the womb (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Reuben&#8217;s discovery shows God weaving everyday moments into His redemptive plan, just as He would later use simple barley loaves and fish (<a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he brought them to his mother</b><p>&#8220;When he brought them to his mother&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The tenderness of a son presenting a gift to Leah spotlights their bond.

Slowly and unwillingly she would substitute Zilpah for herself, and there would then be a further period of three or four years, to give time for the birth of Gad and Asher: and as Jacob at this time utterly neglected Leah, we do not know but that even a longer space intervened. Moreover, Jacob had other daughters besides Dinah (<a href="/genesis/37-35.htm" title="And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave to my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.">Genesis 37:35</a>), and probably by these handmaids.

Canon Tristram (<span class= "ital">Nat. Hist. of Bible, </span>p. 467) says that the fruit is not unpleasant, and that he has often eaten of it without experiencing any soporific or other bad effect. But in the East it has been, and is, the subject of many superstitions, and its Hebrew name arose from the popular belief that it was a specific against barrenness. Rachel, therefore, who still hankered after children of her own, was anxious to obtain some of the fruit, and Leah consents only upon the proffered condition that Jacob shall spend the night in her tent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Reuben</span> (at this time four or five years old) <span class="cmt_word">went</span> (probably accompanying the reapers) <span class="cmt_word">in the days of wheat harvest</span> (in the beginning of May), <span class="cmt_word">and found mandrakes</span> - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, (LXX., Josephus), apples of the mandragora, an herb resembling belladonna, with a root like a carrot, having white and reddish blossoms of a sweet smell, and with yellow odoriferous apples, ripening in May and June, and supposed, according to Oriental superstition, to possess the virtue of conciliating love and promoting fruitfulness (<span class="accented">vide</span> Gesenius, p. 191, and cf.
