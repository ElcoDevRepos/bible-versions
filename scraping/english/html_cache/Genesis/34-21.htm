The notion of peace here is significant, as it suggests a desire for harmonious relations and mutual benefit. In the ancient Near Eastern context, peace treaties and alliances were common among tribes and city-states to ensure security and economic prosperity. This statement is ironic, given the underlying tension and deceit that will unfold in the narrative. The concept of peace is also a recurring biblical theme, often associated with God's covenant people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>Let them live and trade in our land;</b><br>The invitation to live and trade indicates an openness to economic integration and social interaction. In the ancient world, trade was a vital part of life, facilitating the exchange of goods, culture, and ideas. The land of Canaan, where this event takes place, was a crossroads of trade routes, making it a strategic location for commerce. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual settlement of the Israelites in Canaan, as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The idea of living and trading together suggests a blending of communities, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel and its neighbors.<p><b>indeed, it is large enough for them.</b><br>This statement emphasizes the abundance and capacity of the land to support both the Hivites and Jacob's family. The land of Canaan was known for its fertility and resources, often described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The mention of the land's largeness can be seen as an assurance of provision and prosperity, aligning with God's promises to the patriarchs about the land (<a href="/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-15</a>). It also highlights the potential for peaceful coexistence, though the narrative will reveal the complexities of such integration.<p><b>Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them.</b><br>This proposal for intermarriage reflects common practices in the ancient Near East, where marriages were often used to solidify alliances and ensure peace between different groups. However, for the Israelites, intermarriage with Canaanites was a contentious issue, as it could lead to the adoption of foreign gods and practices, contrary to God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). This phrase foreshadows future challenges Israel will face regarding intermarriage and idolatry. Theologically, it contrasts with the biblical ideal of maintaining a distinct identity as God's chosen people, set apart for His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>A city in the land of Canaan, significant in biblical history as a place of both conflict and covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince, who seeks to make peace with Jacob's family after his son defiles Dinah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, whose daughter Dinah is central to the events of this chapter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>The daughter of Jacob and Leah, whose defilement by Shechem sets off the events of <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hivites.htm">The Hivites</a></b><br>A Canaanite people living in the land, represented by Hamor and Shechem in this account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_compromise.htm">The Dangers of Compromise</a></b><br>The proposal by Hamor and Shechem to intermarry with Jacob's family represents a potential compromise of faith and values.

The verse exposes how worldly offers of peace and benefit can lure God&#8217;s people toward compromise. Living peaceably is commendable, but not at the expense of obedience.

Jacob's men were also chiefly of the Semitic stock, and therefore possessed of high physical and mental endowments; and as they were rich in cattle and other wealth, their incorporation with the people of Shechem would raise it to a high rank among the petty states of Canaan. There was much plausibility, therefore, in Hamor's proposal and arguments.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are at peace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1469;&#1500;&#1461;&#1502;&#1460;&#1447;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8003.htm">Strong's 8003: </a> </span><span class="str2">Complete, safe, at peace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with us.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Let them live</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and trade</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yis&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5503.htm">Strong's 5503: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go around or about, travel about</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in our land;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1433;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">indeed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
