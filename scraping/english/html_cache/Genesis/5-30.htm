Noah is a pivotal figure in biblical history, as he is chosen by God to survive the Flood and repopulate the earth. The mention of Noah here sets the stage for the upcoming narrative of the Flood, emphasizing his importance in God's plan. Noah's name, meaning "rest" or "comfort," is prophetic, as he will bring relief from the curse of the ground (<a href="/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>). This connection to the curse links back to <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, where the ground is cursed because of Adam's sin.<p><b>Lamech lived 595 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> are often seen as indicative of the antediluvian (pre-Flood) world, where conditions were different from today. These extended lifespans may symbolize the vitality and longevity of early humanity, reflecting a world not yet fully corrupted by sin. Lamech's lifespan, like those of his ancestors, underscores the continuity of life and the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The genealogical record serves to bridge the gap between Adam and Noah, maintaining the lineage through which God's promises will be fulfilled.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Lamech, like other patriarchs, had a large family. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the proliferation of humanity during this period, fulfilling God's command to fill the earth. It also implies that Noah had siblings, though they are not named, emphasizing the focus on the chosen line through which God will act. The presence of other children highlights the broader human context in which the biblical narrative unfolds, setting the stage for the judgment and salvation themes that will be central in the story of the Flood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lamech.htm">Lamech</a></b><br>A descendant of Adam through Seth, Lamech is the father of Noah.
