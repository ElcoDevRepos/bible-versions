In the broader context of <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, God is establishing His covenant with Abraham, primarily through Isaac, yet He acknowledges Abraham's plea for Ishmael. This demonstrates God's attentiveness to the prayers and desires of His people, even when they concern those outside the primary covenant line. It reflects God's compassion and willingness to bless beyond the immediate covenant promises.<p><b>and I will surely bless him;</b><br>God's promise to bless Ishmael shows His grace and generosity. Although Ishmael is not the child of promise through whom the covenant will be fulfilled, God still extends His blessing. This blessing includes material prosperity and numerous descendants, which is a common theme in God's promises to the patriarchs. It highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to bless whom He chooses, regardless of human expectations or plans.<p><b>I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly.</b><br>This promise echoes the language used in God's covenant with Abraham, indicating a significant increase in Ishmael's descendants. The phrase "fruitful and multiply" is reminiscent of the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, suggesting a divine intention for growth and expansion. Historically, Ishmael is considered the ancestor of many Arab tribes, fulfilling this promise of multiplication and fruitfulness.<p><b>He will become the father of twelve rulers,</b><br>This prophecy is fulfilled in <a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-16</a>, where the names of Ishmael's twelve sons are listed, each becoming a tribal leader. The number twelve is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or divine order, as seen in the twelve tribes of Israel. This parallel structure between Ishmael's and Israel's descendants underscores God's orderly plan and the importance of Ishmael's lineage in the broader biblical narrative.<p><b>and I will make him into a great nation.</b><br>The promise of a "great nation" for Ishmael parallels God's earlier promise to Abraham regarding Isaac. While Ishmael's descendants do not inherit the covenant promises given to Isaac, they still become a significant and influential people group. This reflects God's ability to work through various nations and peoples to accomplish His purposes. Historically, the Arab nations trace their lineage to Ishmael, and their prominence in the ancient and modern world attests to the fulfillment of this promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The first son of Abraham, born to Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian maidservant.

Ishmael is not forgotten. In <a href="/genesis/16-11.htm">Genesis 16:11&#8211;12</a> the Angel of the LORD had already spoken of Ishmael&#8217;s future; here God expressly names him again, underscoring personal attention and value. The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s purposes embrace individuals even when they stand outside the main covenant line (compare <a href="/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have heard you</b><p>Abraham had just pleaded, &#8220;Oh, that Ishmael might live before You!&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>). God&#8217;s response models His readiness to listen to intercession (see also <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23&#8211;33</a>; <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;14</a>). The reassurance &#8220;I have heard you&#8221; echoes <a href="/genesis/21-17.htm">Genesis 21:17</a>, where God hears Ishmael&#8217;s own cry. Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord bending His ear to the prayers of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will surely bless him</b><p>Blessing here is tangible, not abstract. As in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>, blessing involves real-world favor&#8212;provision, protection, posterity. Though Ishmael does not inherit the covenant promises tied to Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19, 21</a>), he is still the recipient of genuine divine goodwill. This demonstrates the breadth of God&#8217;s mercy, paralleling <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a> where God &#8220;sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly</b><p>Fruitfulness is a recurring covenant theme (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; 9:1; 26:24). God pledges exponential growth for Ishmael&#8217;s line, and history confirms vast tribes descending from him. The language mirrors the promise to Jacob in <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>, highlighting God&#8217;s consistent pattern: multiplication is a sign of divine favor. For Ishmael, this means large families, expanding territories, and enduring cultural influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will become the father of twelve rulers</b><p><a href="/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13&#8211;15</a> lists Ishmael&#8217;s twelve sons&#8212;Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah&#8212;each heading a clan. The precision of &#8220;twelve&#8221; showcases God&#8217;s sovereignty in shaping nations (compare the twelve tribes from Jacob in <a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22&#8211;26</a>). These princes governed nomadic confederations stretching from Havilah to Shur (<a href="/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a>), fulfilling the prophetic detail exactly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I will make him into a great nation</b><p>God reiterates and expands on <a href="/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13, 18</a>. &#8220;Great&#8221; speaks to both size and endurance. Historically, Ishmael&#8217;s descendants populated large portions of Arabia, influencing trade routes, language, and culture long before the rise of later empires (see also <a href="/isaiah/60-7.htm">Isaiah 60:7</a>, which mentions Kedar). God&#8217;s word proved accurate: Ishmael&#8217;s line became formidable, distinct, and recognizable on the world stage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a> affirms that the Lord, while establishing a covenant line through Isaac, extends real, measurable blessing to Ishmael. He hears Abraham&#8217;s prayer, promises tangible favor, guarantees prolific multiplication, outlines specific leadership through twelve sons, and frames Ishmael&#8217;s heritage as a lasting, influential nation. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word, His attentiveness to intercession, and the reach of His benevolence beyond the primary covenant family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee</span> (meaning, also, "and will grant thy prayer;
