This highlights the patriarchal structure of the family, where the father holds authority and responsibility. Simeon and Levi's actions reflect a breach of family unity and obedience, which is a recurring theme in the narratives of the patriarchs.<p><b>&#8220;You have brought trouble upon me</b><br>Jacob expresses concern over the consequences of his sons' actions. The Hebrew word for "trouble" can imply a deep disturbance or calamity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of sin leading to turmoil, as seen in the stories of Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel.<p><b>by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites,</b><br>The metaphor of being a "stench" indicates a severe loss of reputation and favor. The Canaanites and Perizzites were significant inhabitants of the land, and maintaining peaceful relations with them was crucial for survival. This phrase underscores the importance of reputation and alliances in ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>the people of this land.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the foreign and potentially hostile environment in which Jacob and his family lived. The land was not yet theirs, and they were surrounded by established nations. This context is crucial for understanding the precarious position of the patriarchs before the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land.<p><b>We are few in number;</b><br>Jacob's concern about their small numbers highlights the vulnerability of his family. This echoes earlier biblical narratives where God's people are often depicted as a remnant or minority, reliant on divine protection rather than military might.<p><b>if they unite against me and attack me,</b><br>Jacob fears a coalition of local tribes against his family, a common threat in the ancient world where tribal alliances could quickly form. This reflects the constant tension and need for strategic alliances in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>I and my household will be destroyed.&#8221;</b><br>The potential destruction of Jacob's household underscores the fragility of God's covenant promises, which are often threatened by human actions. This phrase also foreshadows future threats to the Israelites, such as their enslavement in Egypt and later conflicts in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Simeon and Levi, who expresses concern over the actions of his sons.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/simeon_and_levi.htm">Simeon and Levi</a></b><br>Sons of Jacob who took violent revenge on the city of Shechem for the defilement of their sister, Dinah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites_and_perizzites.htm">Canaanites and Perizzites</a></b><br>Inhabitants of the land surrounding Jacob's family, representing potential threats due to the actions of Simeon and Levi.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The city where Dinah was defiled, leading to the subsequent violent actions by Simeon and Levi.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>Daughter of Jacob and Leah, whose defilement by Shechem led to the conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_impulsive_actions.htm">Consequences of Impulsive Actions</a></b><br>Simeon and Levi's actions brought unintended consequences upon their family.

His words stress personal accountability, the destructive ripple effects of sin, and dependence on God&#8217;s protection to preserve the line of promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Ye have troubled me.</span>--Jacob's timidity led him to think first of the danger that would result from the conduct of his sons, and only afterwards of the cruelty and treacherousness of their deed. He commented upon this on his dying bed in words of fitting reprobation, but his reproof now is singularly weak, and the retort of his sons just. If the danger were all, this could have no weight when a shameful wrong had been done; but in avenging this wrong they had committed a crime of a deeper dye<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> brought trouble upon me) <span class="cmt_word">to make me to stink</span> - or, to cause me to become hateful; <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (LXX.) - <span class="cmt_word">among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Perizzites</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>): <span class="cmt_word">and I</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. with my attendants) being <span class="cmt_word">few in number</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">men of number, i.e.</span> that can be easily numbered, a small band (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a>; <a href="/psalms/105.htm">Psalm 105</a>.. 12; <a href="/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>) - they (literally, <span class="accented">and they</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</span> That Jacob should have spoken to his sons only of his own danger, and not of their guilt, has been ascribed to his belief that this was the only motive which their carnal minds could understand (Keil, Gerlach); to a remembrance of his own deceitfulness, which disqualified him in a measure from being the censor of his sons (Kalisch, Wordsworth); to the lowered moral and spiritual tone of his own mind (Candlish, 'Speaker's Commentary'); to the circumstance that, having indulged his children in their youth, be was now afraid to reprove them (Inglis). That Jacob afterwards attained to a proper estimate of their bloody deed his last prophetic utterance reveals (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). By some it is supposed that he even now felt the crime in all its heinousness (Kalisch), though his reproach was somewhat leniently expressed in the word "trouble" (Lange); while others, believing Jacob's abhorrence of his sons' fanatical cruelty to have been deep and real, account for its omission by the historian on the ground that he aimed merely at showing "<span class="accented">the</span> protection of God (<a href="/genesis/35-5.htm">Genesis 35:5</a>), through which Jacob escaped the evil consequences of their conduct" (Hengstenberg, Kurtz). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
