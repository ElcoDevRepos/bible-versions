It reflects the significance of Jacob's transformation and the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>because the socket of Jacob&#8217;s hip was struck near that tendon</b><br>The striking of Jacob's hip by the divine being during their wrestling match left him with a limp, symbolizing both his vulnerability and the transformative nature of his encounter with God. This physical mark served as a reminder of his new identity as Israel, meaning "he struggles with God." The event is a turning point in Jacob's life, marking his transition from a man of cunning to one who relies on God's blessing.
