The term "your servant" reflects the cultural norm of showing respect and humility, especially in familial relationships. Jacob, also known as Israel, is a patriarchal figure, and his sons' return signifies the continuation of the narrative of the chosen family line. This return is significant as it sets the stage for the unfolding of God's plan for Israel's family to move to Egypt, which is a pivotal moment in biblical history.<p><b>we relayed your words to him</b><br>The brothers are recounting their obedience to Joseph's command, which they did not fully understand at the time. This act of relaying Joseph's words is crucial as it demonstrates their role as intermediaries between Joseph and Jacob. It also highlights the theme of communication and obedience in the biblical narrative. The words they relayed included the conditions set by Joseph for seeing Benjamin, which were part of God's providential plan to reunite the family and preserve them during the famine. This moment foreshadows the eventual revelation of Joseph's identity and the reconciliation of the family, which is a type of Christ's reconciliation of humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers to see if they have changed since they sold him into slavery.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- One of Joseph's brothers, who is speaking to Joseph in this passage, recounting the events to their father, Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>- The father of Joseph and his brothers, who is deeply affected by the loss of Joseph and the potential loss of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The land where Joseph has risen to power and where the brothers have come to buy grain during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>- The homeland of Jacob and his sons, where they return to relay Joseph's words.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_communication.htm">The Importance of Communication</a></b><br>Judah's recounting of events to Jacob highlights the necessity of clear and honest communication within families, especially in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_change.htm">Repentance and Change</a></b><br>The brothers' willingness to return to Egypt and face potential consequences shows a change of heart from their earlier betrayal of Joseph.
