The chief servant, likely Eliezer of Damascus (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), is entrusted with this important task. This reflects the trust and authority given to servants in ancient households, where they often managed significant affairs. The role of a chief servant was akin to a steward, responsible for the master's property and affairs, indicating a high level of trust and responsibility.<p><b>who managed all he owned</b><br>This phrase highlights the servant's significant role and authority within Abraham's household. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a chief servant would have been responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the household, including financial matters and the management of other servants. This position required wisdom, loyalty, and integrity, qualities that Abraham evidently saw in his servant. The trust placed in this servant is reminiscent of Joseph's role in Potiphar's house (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4-6</a>), where he was given charge over all that Potiphar owned.<p><b>&#8220;Place your hand under my thigh&#8221;</b><br>This gesture was a customary practice in ancient times, signifying a solemn oath or covenant. The thigh was considered a symbol of strength and progeny, and placing a hand under it was a way to invoke the seriousness of the promise being made. This act is seen in other biblical contexts, such as when Jacob asks Joseph to swear an oath in a similar manner (<a href="/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>). The act of swearing by placing a hand under the thigh underscores the gravity and binding nature of the commitment, often involving matters of great importance, such as family lineage and inheritance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

Abraham, now advanced in years (<a href="/genesis/24-1.htm">Genesis 24:1</a>), is taking steps to secure God&#8217;s covenant promises for the next generation.<p>&#8226; His initiative echoes earlier moments where faith met obedience, such as his journey to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>) and the binding of Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently presents Abraham as proactive in matters of faith, reminding us that trusting God does not preclude decisive planning (cf. <a href="/james/2-22.htm">James 2:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the chief servant of his household</b><p>&#8226; This &#8220;chief servant&#8221; is traditionally identified as Eliezer of Damascus, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>.<p>&#8226; The title signals more than employment; it reflects intimate association and proven loyalty, akin to Joseph&#8217;s role in Potiphar&#8217;s house (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s reliance on a faithful steward parallels New Testament calls for believers to be trustworthy managers of God&#8217;s gifts (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who managed all he owned</b><p>&#8226; Total oversight means the servant understood Abraham&#8217;s values and, crucially, his covenant conviction that Isaac must not marry a Canaanite (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Such stewardship foreshadows the parable of the talents, where faithfulness over &#8220;few things&#8221; leads to greater trust (<a href="/matthew/25-20.htm">Matthew 25:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse illustrates the biblical pattern: authority is granted to those who demonstrate integrity under authority (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Place your hand under my thigh&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This gesture was a solemn oath in patriarchal culture, binding the servant to carry out the task with utmost fidelity.<p>&#8226; By involving the patriarch&#8217;s body&#8212;through which the covenant seed had come and would continue&#8212;Abraham anchors the oath in God&#8217;s promise of descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Comparable covenant signs include the &#8220;cutting&#8221; of animals in <a href="/genesis/15-9.htm">Genesis 15:9-18</a>, showing that God&#8217;s people often ratified promises through tangible, weighty acts (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The request points forward to the seriousness with which believers should treat vows (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a> highlights Abraham&#8217;s intentional faith at life&#8217;s twilight, entrusting his most dependable servant with a covenant-critical mission and binding him by a solemn oath. The verse underscores themes of faithful stewardship, righteous leadership, and the gravity of commitments made in God&#8217;s presence&#8212;principles that remain vital for every follower of Christ today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Unto his eldest servant of his house.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">his servant, the elder of his house. </span>It is the name of an office; and though one holding so confidential a post would be a man of ripe years, yet it is not probable that Abraham would send any one who was not still vigorous on so distant a journey. Eliezer of Damascus had held a similar office fifty-five years previously (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a>), but this was probably a younger man.<p><span class= "bld">Put </span>. . . <span class= "bld">thy hand under my thigh.</span>--As Jacob requires that Joseph should swear to him in the same manner (<a href="/genesis/47-29.htm" title="And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found grace in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray you, in Egypt:">Genesis 47:29</a>), this form of oath was evidently regarded as a very solemn one. The meaning of it has been much discussed, but we find the thigh in <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm" title="All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were three score and six;">Genesis 46:26</a>, <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm" title="And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.">Exodus 1:5</a>--in both which places it is rendered <span class= "ital">loins</span>--used as the source of posterity. Probably, therefore, as Tuch argues, it is an euphemistic manner of describing the circumcised member, which was to be touched by the hand placed bene<span class= "bld">Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.</span>--The betrothal of Isaac and Rebekah is told with the utmost exactness of detail, because it contained two principles of primary importance to Abraham's posterity: the first, that they were not to allow themselves to be merged among the Canaanites, but remain a distinct people; for this intermarriage with women of their own race was only a means to an end, and not a binding law, to be observed for its own sake. And secondly, that under no circumstances might they return to Mesopotamia, but must cling devotedly to the land of which God had promised them the possession. We learn from <a href="/genesis/24-8.htm" title="And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.">Genesis 24:8</a> that this second point was regarded by Abraham as even more important than the first; and with reason. For the race might remain distinct even if Isaac took a woman of Palestine to wife, though there would be the risk of religious deterioration; but if they returned to Padanaram they were certain to be absorbed, and could look for no higher lot than that attained to by Laban's descendants. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said auto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to his servant, the old man</span>, ancient or elder, <span class="accented">of his house, the ruler over all which</span> (sc. belonged) <span class="accented">to him</span>. The term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (an old man) is in most languages employed as a title of honor, - cf. <span class="accented">sheikh, senatus</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">presbyter</span>, signor, seigneur, senor, sir (Gesenius, p. 252), - and is probably to be so understood here. Eliezer of Damascus, upwards of half a century previous regarded as heir presumptive to Abraham's house (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>), is commonly considered the official meant, though the point is of no importance - <span class="cmt_word">Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: and I will make thee swear.</span> This ancient form of adjuration, which is mentioned again only in chap. 47:29, and to which nothing analogous can elsewhere be discovered, - the practice alleged to exist among the modern Egyptian Bedouins of placing the hand upon the <span class="accented">membrum virile</span> in solemn forms of asseveration not forming an exact parallel, was probably originated by the patriarch. The thigh, as the source of posterity (cf. <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>; <a href="/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>), has been regarded as pointing to Abraham's future descendants (Keil, Kalisch, Lange), and in particular to Christ, the promised seed (Theodoret, Jerome, Augustine, Luther, Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth), and the oath to be equivalent to a swearing by him that was to come. By others the thigh has been viewed as euphemistically put for the generative organ, upon which the sign of circumcision was placed, and the oath as an adjuration by the sign of the covenant (Jonathan, Jarchi, Tuch). A third interpretation considers the thigh as symbolizing lordship or authority, and the placing of the hand under it as tantamount to an oath of fealty and allegiance to a superior (Aben Ezra, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Calvin, Murphy). Other explanations are modifications of the above. <span class="cmt_word">By the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">Jehovah</span>; since the marriage to which this solemn adjuration was preliminary was not an ordinary alliance, such as might have taken place under the providence of Elohim, but the wedding of the heir of the promise), <span class="cmt_word">the God of heaven, and the God of the earth</span> (a clause defining Jehovah as the supreme Lord of the universe, and therefore as the sole Arbiter of human destiny), <span class="cmt_word">that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son</span> - not investing him with authority to provide a wife for Isaac in the event of death carrying him (Abraham) off before his son's marriage, but simply explaining the negative side of the commission with which he was about to be entrusted. If it evinced Isaac's gentle disposition and submissive piety, that though forty years of age he neither thought of marriage, but mourned in devout contemplation for his mother (,Lange), nor offered resistance to his father s proposal, but suffered himself to be governed by a servant (Calvin), it was also quite in accordance with ancient practice that parents should dispose of their children in marriage (cf. <a href="/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> Being prompted to this partly by that jealousy with which all pastoral tribes of Shemitie origin have been accustomed to guard the purity of their race by intermarriage (Dykes; cf. Thomson, 'Land and Book,' p. 591), and partly no doubt by his perception of the growing licentiousness of the Canaanites, as well as his knowledge of their predicted doom, though chiefly, it is probable, by a desire to preserve the purity of the promised seed. Intermarriage with the Canaanites was afterwards forbidden by the Mosaic legislation (<a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (literally, for, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the former thing must not be done because this must be done) <span class="cmt_word">thou shalt go unto my country</span> (not Ur of the Chaldees, but the region beyond the Euphrates generally), <span class="cmt_word">and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.</span> Though enforced by religious considerations, this injunction to bring none but a relative for Isaac's bride "was in no sense a departure from established usages and social laws in regard to marriage" ('Land and Book,' p. 591). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Abraham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;&#183;h&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_85.htm">Strong's 85: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham -- 'exalted father', the father of the Jewish nation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">instructed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
