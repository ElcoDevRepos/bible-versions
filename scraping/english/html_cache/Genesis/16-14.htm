This well marks the place where the Angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar, offering her comfort and a promise for her future. The name reflects Hagar's recognition of God's presence and care, even in her distress. This encounter is one of the earliest instances of a theophany, where God reveals Himself directly to a person. The well becomes a symbol of divine provision and sight, emphasizing God's omnipresence and His ability to see and respond to human suffering. This theme of God seeing and providing is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-12</a>, where God's intimate knowledge of and care for individuals is celebrated.<p><b>It is located between Kadesh and Bered.</b><br>The geographical markers of Kadesh and Bered help to situate the well within the broader narrative of the patriarchs. Kadesh, often associated with Kadesh-barnea, is a significant location in the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites, serving as a place of both testing and revelation. Bered is less well-known, but its mention alongside Kadesh suggests a location in the Negev region, south of Canaan. This area is characterized by its arid climate, making the presence of a well particularly vital for survival. The mention of these locations underscores the historical and geographical reality of the biblical narrative, providing a tangible context for the events described. The well's location also foreshadows future events in the lives of the patriarchs, as it becomes a recurring site in the story of Isaac, who later dwells in the region (<a href="/genesis/24-62.htm">Genesis 24:62</a>). This continuity highlights the enduring significance of God's promises and the places where He reveals Himself to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai, who fled from Sarai's harsh treatment and encountered the Angel of the LORD by a spring in the desert.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who appeared to Hagar, providing her with guidance and promises about her son, Ishmael.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beer-lahai-roi.htm">Beer-lahai-roi</a></b><br>The well where Hagar encountered the Angel of the LORD.
