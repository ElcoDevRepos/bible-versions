The cave of Machpelah is significant as it becomes the burial site for the patriarchs and matriarchs of Israel. Archaeologically, this site is traditionally identified with the Cave of the Patriarchs in modern-day Hebron, a place of pilgrimage and reverence. The field and cave symbolize a tangible piece of the Promised Land that Abraham legally owns, marking the beginning of the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to his descendants.<p><b>were deeded by the Hittites</b><br>The Hittites, in this context, refer to the inhabitants of the land of Canaan, not the Anatolian Hittite Empire. This transaction is significant as it is one of the earliest recorded instances of a legal property transaction in the Bible. The deed signifies a formal and recognized transfer of property, emphasizing the legitimacy of Abraham's claim. The Hittites' willingness to sell the land to Abraham reflects his status and respect in the region, despite being a foreigner.<p><b>to Abraham</b><br>Abraham, the patriarch of the Israelites, is central to the narrative of Genesis. His acquisition of the burial site is a testament to his faith and God's covenant with him. This purchase is a step towards the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land. It also underscores Abraham's foresight and faith in God's promises, as he secures a permanent place for his family in the Promised Land.<p><b>as a burial site</b><br>The designation of the field and cave as a burial site is significant for several reasons. Culturally, it reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of family burials, which were important for maintaining family heritage and identity. Biblically, it foreshadows the future burials of Sarah, Abraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob, making it a foundational site for the Israelite patriarchs. Theologically, it points to the hope of resurrection and eternal life, themes that are later fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

It is the first piece of the promised land Abraham actually owns. Earlier the LORD said, &#8220;To your offspring I will give this land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>), and here that promise moves from word to deed.<p>&#8226; Owning real soil in Canaan confirms God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. Much later David will insist on paying full price for his own sacred plot, saying, &#8220;I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God that cost me nothing&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>). Like David, Abraham refuses a gift; he purchases the land so the title is incontestable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and its cave</b><p>&#8226; The cave of Machpelah becomes the family tomb: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah will all rest here (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-32</a>; 50:13).<p>&#8226; Caves offered permanence and protection. Securing both field and cave ensures the family&#8217;s remains stay in the land of promise, witnessing to future generations that God will bring them back. When Joseph later says, &#8220;Carry my bones up from here&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>), he is echoing this same confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were deeded</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Deeded&#8221; tells us a public, legal transfer took place. The city gate elders watch; silver is weighed; boundaries are listed (<a href="/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16-18</a>). Everything is transparent.<p>&#8226; Scripture treats written deeds as enduring proof. Jeremiah likewise signs and seals a purchase during national crisis, declaring, &#8220;Houses and fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9-15</a>). In both cases, buying property testifies to trust in God&#8217;s future.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the Hittites</b><p>&#8226; The Hittites (sons of Heth) are resident Canaanites. They address Abraham as &#8220;a mighty prince among us&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>), recognizing God&#8217;s blessing on him even though he is still, technically, an immigrant (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their participation means pagan witnesses affirm the sale, eliminating future disputes. Later conflicts over burial places&#8212;such as concerning Jesus&#8217; empty tomb&#8212;show how vital public verification can be (<a href="/matthew/27-62.htm">Matthew 27:62-66</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Abraham</b><p>&#8226; Though the land is promised to his offspring, the deed bears Abraham&#8217;s own name. <a href="/acts/7-5.htm">Acts 7:5</a> reminds us, &#8220;He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But He promised that he and his descendants would possess it.&#8221; <a href="/bsb/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a> is that &#8220;foot of ground.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The transaction underlines Abraham&#8217;s faith in God&#8217;s timing. He buries Sarah in hope, trusting that the God who gave him Isaac can also fill the land with descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a burial site</b><p>&#8226; Burial fixes Abraham&#8217;s family story in God&#8217;s story.

The palpable discrepancy between the statements of the Hebrew historian in this chapter concerning the patriarchal sepulcher and those of the Christian orator when addressing the Jewish Sanhedrim (<a href="/acts/7-16.htm">Acts 7:16</a>) has been well characterized as <span class="accented">praegravis quaedam et perardua, et quorundam judicio inextricabilis quaestio</span> (Pererius). Of course the Gordian knot of difficulty may be very readily cut by boldly asserting that a mistake has been committed somewhere; either by Stephen, the original speaker, under the impulse of emotion confounding the two entirely different stories of Abraham's purchase of Machpelah and Jacob's buying of the field near Shechem (Beds, Clarke, Lange, Kalisch, Alford, and others); or by Luke, the first recorder of the Martyr's Apology, who wrote not the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the speech, but simply his own recollection of them (Jerome); or by some subsequent transcriber who had tampered with the original text, as, e.g., inserting <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, which Luke and Stephen both had omitted, as the nominative to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (Beza, Calvin, Bishop Pearce). The Just of these hypotheses would not indeed be fatal to the Inspiration of the record; but the claims of either Luke or Stephen to be authoritative teachers on the subject of religion would be somewhat hard to maintain if it once were admitted that they had blundered on a plain point in their own national history. And yet it is doubtful if any of the proposed solutions of the problem is perfectly satisfactory; such as <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the two purchases of Abraham and Jacob are here intentionally, for the sake of brevity, compressed into one account (Bengel, Pererius, Willet, Hughes); or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Abraham bought two graves, one at Hebron of Ephron the Hittite, as recorded by Moses, and another at Shechem of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem (Words. worth); or <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the words "which Abraham bought for a sum of money" should be regarded as a parenthesis, and the sentence read as intimating that Jacob and the fathers were carried over into Shechem, and (afterwards) by the sons of Hamor the lather of Shechem interred in Abraham's sepulcher at Hebron (Cajetan). Obvious difficulties attach to each of them; but the facts shine out clear enough in spite of the encompassing obscurity, viz., that Abraham bought a tomb at Hebron, in which first the dust of Sarah was deposited, and to which afterwards the bodies of himself, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah were consigned, while Joseph and the twelve patriarchs, who all died in Egypt, were brought over to the promised land and buried in Jacob's field at Shechem.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the field</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#7695;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
