Goshen, located in the northeastern part of Egypt, was a fertile area ideal for shepherding, which suited the Israelites' pastoral lifestyle. This region provided a safe haven during the famine and allowed them to maintain their distinct cultural and religious identity. The choice of Goshen also reflects Joseph's influence in Pharaoh's court, as he secured this prime location for his family. This settlement foreshadows the eventual Exodus, as the Israelites' time in Egypt was both a period of growth and a precursor to their deliverance.<p><b>They acquired property there</b><br>The acquisition of property indicates a level of acceptance and integration into Egyptian society, albeit temporarily. This was unusual for foreigners, suggesting that Joseph's high status afforded his family special privileges. This phrase also highlights God's provision and blessing, as the Israelites were able to thrive even in a foreign land. The ability to own property would have provided stability and a means to support their growing numbers, setting the stage for their eventual departure as a substantial nation.<p><b>and became fruitful and increased greatly in number.</b><br>This phrase echoes the creation mandate in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where God commands humanity to be fruitful and multiply. It also recalls God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2 and 15</a>:5, that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. The rapid growth of the Israelites in Egypt is a testament to God's faithfulness and blessing. This increase in numbers would later be seen as a threat by a new Pharaoh, leading to their enslavement (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-10</a>). The phrase also typologically points to the growth of the Church, as believers are called to multiply spiritually and spread the Gospel throughout the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, who moved to Egypt during a time of famine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites settled, specifically in the region of Goshen, under the protection of Joseph, who was a high-ranking official.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/goshen.htm">Goshen</a></b><br>A fertile region in Egypt where the Israelites were allowed to settle, providing them with the resources needed to thrive.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>One of Jacob's sons, who rose to power in Egypt and facilitated the settlement of his family in Goshen.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food that affected the region, prompting Jacob's family to move to Egypt for survival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_adversity.htm">God's Provision in Adversity</a></b><br>Despite the famine, God provided for the Israelites by placing them in a fertile land.

Israel is no longer a small clan in Canaan but a people planted in a new soil&#8212;exactly as God foretold to Abram that his descendants would sojourn in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The move also demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereign use of apparent calamity&#8212;famine&#8212;to position His people for future deliverance (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the region of Goshen</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;in the region of Goshen&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Goshen, the fertile eastern delta, provided ideal pasture for their flocks (<a href="/genesis/46-34.htm">Genesis 46:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Isolation in Goshen kept Israel culturally distinct from Egyptian idolatry, preserving their worship (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s placement echoes His pattern of setting His people apart: Noah&#8217;s ark amid judgment (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>), the land of Goshen spared from later plagues (<a href="/exodus/8-22.htm">Exodus 8:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They acquired property there</b><p>&#8220;They acquired property there&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Ownership marks stability and divine favor, contrasting with Egyptians who, amid famine, sold land to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/47-20.htm">Genesis 47:20-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase fulfills Joseph&#8217;s assurance of provision (<a href="/genesis/45-11.htm">Genesis 45:11</a>) and hints at God&#8217;s blessing of Abraham&#8217;s seed with increase&#8212;even in exile (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Material prosperity here prefigures the later plundering of Egypt at the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And became fruitful and increased greatly in number</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and became fruitful and increased greatly in number&#8221;.<p>&#8226; This echoes the creation mandate (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>) and God&#8217;s covenant word to Abraham: &#8220;I will make you into a great nation&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; 22:17).<p>&#8226; The multiplication sets the stage for <a href="/exodus/1-7.htm">Exodus 1:7</a>, where Israel&#8217;s growth alarms Pharaoh.
