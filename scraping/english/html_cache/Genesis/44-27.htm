The term "servant" reflects the humility and respect Judah shows towards his father, a common cultural practice in ancient Near Eastern societies. This phrase sets the stage for Judah's plea to Joseph, highlighting the familial hierarchy and the deep respect for parental authority. It also underscores the gravity of the situation, as Judah is speaking on behalf of his brothers to Joseph, who is still unrecognized by them as their brother.<p><b>&#8216;You know that my wife bore me two sons.</b><br>Jacob refers to Rachel, his beloved wife, who bore him Joseph and Benjamin. This statement is significant because it highlights the special status of these two sons in Jacob's eyes, which is a recurring theme in Genesis. Rachel's barrenness and eventual motherhood are pivotal in the narrative of Jacob's family, as seen in <a href="/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22-24</a>. The mention of "two sons" also foreshadows the tension and favoritism that have characterized Jacob's family dynamics, leading to Joseph's earlier sale into slavery by his brothers. This favoritism is a critical element in the unfolding drama, as it sets the stage for the brothers' jealousy and the subsequent events that lead to their current predicament in Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, father of Joseph and Benjamin.
