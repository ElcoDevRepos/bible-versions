Paddan-aram, located in Mesopotamia, was where Jacob fled to escape Esau's wrath and where he married Leah and Rachel. This return signifies a fulfillment of God's promise to bring Jacob back to the land of his fathers (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). It also represents a spiritual journey, as Jacob is returning to the land of promise, a key theme in the patriarchal narratives.<p><b>he arrived safely at the city of Shechem</b><br>Shechem is a significant location in biblical history. It is the first place Abraham built an altar to the Lord when he entered Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a>). The mention of Jacob's safe arrival underscores God's protection and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. Shechem later becomes a city of refuge and a Levitical city, playing a crucial role in Israel's history. The city's name means "shoulder," possibly indicating its geographical position between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim.<p><b>in the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. It represents the inheritance and the fulfillment of God's covenant. The land is often seen as a type of the believer's spiritual inheritance in Christ. Canaan's inhabitants were known for their idolatry, which posed a constant threat to the spiritual purity of the Israelites. Jacob's presence in Canaan signifies the continuation of God's plan through the patriarchs.<p><b>and he camped just outside the city</b><br>Jacob's decision to camp outside Shechem rather than entering the city may reflect a desire to maintain separation from the Canaanite inhabitants, adhering to the principle of being in the world but not of it. This act of camping outside the city can be seen as a precursor to the Israelites' later experiences of living in tents during their wilderness wanderings. It also foreshadows the tension between the Israelites and the Canaanites, which is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to Canaan after years in Paddan-aram.

Each clause underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;guiding, protecting, and positioning Jacob exactly where the promises to Abraham and Isaac are to unfold.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem.</span>--The Sam. Pent. has <span class= "ital">shalom,"</span>safe"; but <span class= "ital">shalem </span>is right, and means <span class= "ital">whole, sound. </span>Onkelos, however, followed by most modern commentators, renders it <span class= "ital">in peace, </span>but this too would not mean <span class= "ital">peaceably, </span>but that his troubles were now at an end, and his lameness cured. Philippsohn's rendering, however, is more exact, namely, <span class= "ital">wohlbehalten, </span>in good condition. Rashi also, no mean authority, sees in it an allusion to the cure of Jacob's lameness. As Shechem was a man, his city would not be Shalem, but that called after his own name. In <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a> it is called "Sichern," where see Note. Sichern was probably the old name, but after the cruel fate brought upon it by Shechem's misconduct the spelling was modified to suit the history.<p><span class= "bld">In the land of Canaan.</span>--Jacob therefore had now crossed the river Jordan, and so far completed his homeward journey. Probably as soon as he had recovered from his lameness he visited his father, but as his possessions were large, and Esau was the chief at Hebron, there was no room at present for him to dwell there, nor in fact was this possible until Isaac's death. But as we find Deborah with them soon afterwards, it is plain that he had gone to visit Isaac, and, finding his mother dead, had brought away with him her beloved nurse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob</span> (leaving Succoth) <span class="cmt_word">came to Shalem</span> - the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, rendered by some expositors as here (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Luther, Calvin, Peele, Wordsworth), is better taken as an adverb signifying in peace or in safety (Onkelos, Saadias, Rashi, Dathius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Keil, Kalisch, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), meaning that Jacob Was now sound in his limb (Jarehi) and <span class="cmt_word">safe</span> in his person, being no more endangered by Esau (Gerundensis in Drusius), or that he had hitherto met with no misfortune, though soon to encounter one in the instance of Dinah (Patrick), or that the expectations of Jacob expressed in <a href="/genesis/28-21.htm">Genesis 28:21</a> (to which there is an obvious allusion) were now fulfilled (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">a city of Shechem</span>, - if Shalem be the name of the town, then probably Shechem is the name of the person referred to in <a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>, viz., the son of Hamor the Hivite (Drusius, Peele);
