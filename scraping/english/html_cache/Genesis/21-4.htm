The number eight often symbolizes new beginnings in the Bible. Scientifically, it is noted that the eighth day is optimal for circumcision due to the natural peak in vitamin K levels, which aids in blood clotting. This timing underscores the divine wisdom in God's command.<p><b>Abraham circumcised him</b><br>Circumcision was a physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, marking them as God's chosen people. Abraham's obedience in circumcising Isaac demonstrates his faithfulness to God's commands. This act is a precursor to the New Testament's emphasis on the circumcision of the heart, symbolizing spiritual purity and dedication to God (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>).<p><b>as God had commanded him</b><br>This phrase highlights Abraham's obedience to God's specific instructions, which were first given in <a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>. It reflects the importance of following divine commands precisely, a theme that recurs throughout Scripture. Abraham's compliance is a model of faith and obedience, which is later echoed in the New Testament by Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.
