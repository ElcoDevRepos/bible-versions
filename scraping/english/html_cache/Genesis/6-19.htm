The command to bring two of every kind underscores the importance of biodiversity and the continuation of species. This act of preservation reflects God's sovereignty and care for His creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> where He declares all He made as "very good." The ark serves as a vessel of salvation, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate means of deliverance from judgment. The number two signifies completeness and partnership, ensuring the propagation of each species post-flood.<p><b>male and female&#8212;</b><br>The specification of male and female pairs highlights the necessity of both genders for reproduction and the continuation of life. This mirrors the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where God creates humanity in His image, male and female. The emphasis on gender pairs also reflects the biblical theme of complementarity and the divine order established in creation. This pairing is essential for the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), ensuring the earth would be repopulated after the flood.<p><b>to keep them alive with you.</b><br>The phrase underscores Noah's role as a steward of God's creation, tasked with the responsibility of preserving life. This stewardship is a continuation of the mandate given to humanity in <a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>, where Adam is placed in the Garden of Eden to "work it and keep it." The ark becomes a microcosm of the world, with Noah acting as a caretaker. This act of preservation is a testament to God's grace and mercy, providing a means of survival amidst judgment. It also foreshadows the salvation offered through Christ, who brings life and restoration to a fallen world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.

But the terms are conditioned by the usual rules for the interpretation of the language of Holy Scripture, and by the internal necessities of the event itself. Thus the animals in the ark could not have been more in number than four men and four women could attend to Next, the terms exclude the carnivora (see also Note on <a href="/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a>). Not only was there no supply of animals taken on board to feed them, but half-tamed as they would have been by a year's sojourn in the ark, they would have remained in Noah's neighbourhood, and very soon have destroyed all the cattle which had been saved, especially as far and wide no other living creatures would have existed for their food. But if miracles are to be invoked to obviate these and similar difficulties. not only would it have been easier to save Noah and the denizens of the ark by one display of supernatural power, but the ark was the means provided by God for this purpose; and if He wrought thus far by human instrumentality, in accordance with the usual law of the Divine working on earth, to help out the human means employed by repeated acts of omnipotence would have been to proclaim it as insufficient. It does not follow from this that no special providence watched over and guided the ark; such providence is often exercised now, but it works through and in accordance with the ordinary laws by which God governs the world.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19-21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort</span> (literally, by <span class="accented">twos, i.e.</span> in pairs) <span class="cmt_word">shalt thou bring into</span> - or cause to enter, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> receive them when they come (ver. 20) - <span class="cmt_word">the ark, to keep them alive</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to cause to live</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); in order to preserve alive (sc. the animals) - <span class="cmt_word">with thee; they shall be male and female.
