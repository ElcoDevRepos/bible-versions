In the biblical context, the serpent represents Satan or evil, and the woman represents humanity, beginning with Eve. This enmity signifies the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil. Historically, this reflects the struggle between humanity and sin, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible. Theologically, it sets the stage for the redemptive narrative that unfolds in Scripture.<p><b>and between your seed and her seed</b><br>The "seed" of the serpent refers to those who follow the ways of evil, while the "seed" of the woman points to those who follow God. This phrase is often seen as a prophecy of the coming Messiah, who would be born of a woman and ultimately defeat evil. The reference to "her seed" is unique, as lineage is typically traced through the male in biblical genealogies, hinting at the virgin birth of Christ. This connection is further supported by passages such as <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a> and <a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>, which speak of the virgin birth.<p><b>He will crush your head</b><br>This part of the verse is interpreted as a prophecy of Christ's ultimate victory over Satan. Crushing the head signifies a fatal blow, indicating total defeat. This is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus' death and resurrection, which conquers sin and death. <a href="/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a> echoes this victory, promising that God will soon crush Satan under the feet of believers, reinforcing the theme of triumph over evil.<p><b>and you will strike his heel</b><br>The striking of the heel suggests a wound or attack that is not fatal. This is often seen as a reference to the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus, where Satan appeared to have a temporary victory. However, this wound was not the end, as Christ's resurrection demonstrated His power over death. This phrase highlights the temporary nature of Satan's power and the ultimate victory of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, which speaks of Jesus destroying the devil's power through His death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker of the verse, pronouncing judgment and prophecy

Here the curse manifestly outgrows the literal serpent, and refers almost exclusively to the invisible tempter. The hostility commenced between the woman and her destroyer was to be continued by their descendants - the seed of the serpent being those of Eve's posterity who should imbibe the devil's spirit and obey the devil's rule (cf. <a href="/matthew/23-33.htm">Matthew 23:33</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-10.htm">1 John 3:10</a>); and the seed of the woman signifying those whose character and life should be of an opposite description, and in particular the Lord Jesus Christ, who is styled by preeminence "the Seed" (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16, 19</a>), and who came "to destroy the works of the devil" (<a href="/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>).
