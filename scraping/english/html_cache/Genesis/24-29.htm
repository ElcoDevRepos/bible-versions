Laban's character is further developed in later chapters, particularly in his interactions with Jacob. He is known for his shrewdness and sometimes deceitful behavior, as seen in <a href="/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>. Laban's introduction here sets the stage for his future involvement in the lives of the patriarchs. His name, meaning "white" or "shining," may reflect cultural or familial significance. Laban's role in the family dynamics is crucial, as he later becomes the father of Leah and Rachel, who marry Jacob, thus intertwining the family lines of Abraham and Nahor.<p><b>and he rushed out to the man</b><br>Laban's immediate reaction to rush out suggests a sense of urgency or eagerness. This could indicate his interest in the wealth and status of the visitor, as seen later when he deals with Jacob. The cultural context of hospitality in the ancient Near East would have also played a role, as welcoming a stranger was a significant duty. Laban's actions may foreshadow his later behavior, where material gain often influences his decisions. This eagerness can be contrasted with the more contemplative and prayerful approach of Abraham's servant, highlighting different motivations and character traits.<p><b>at the spring</b><br>The spring is a central location in this narrative, symbolizing life and sustenance in the arid landscape of the Near East. Springs and wells are often significant in biblical narratives, serving as meeting places and sites of divine encounters. In Genesis, wells are associated with key events in the lives of the patriarchs, such as Hagar's encounter with the angel of the Lord (Genesis 16) and Jacob meeting Rachel (Genesis 29). The spring here is where Abraham's servant meets Rebekah, leading to the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants. This setting underscores the providential nature of the encounter and the unfolding of God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The sister of Laban, who is central to the account of <a href="/bsb/genesis/24.htm">Genesis 24</a>.
