This phrase highlights God's ongoing blessing upon Leah, despite Jacob's preference for Rachel. Leah's ability to conceive multiple times is seen as a divine favor, reflecting the cultural importance of childbearing in ancient Israel. This also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in family dynamics, as seen throughout Genesis.<p><b>and bore a sixth son to Jacob.</b><br>The birth of Leah's sixth son, Zebulun, is part of the larger narrative of the twelve tribes of Israel. Each son born to Jacob represents a future tribe, integral to the formation of the nation of Israel. The number six may symbolize completeness in this context, as Leah has now borne half of Jacob's sons. This event is a continuation of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). The birth of Zebulun also foreshadows the tribe's future role and territory in the Promised Land, as described in later biblical texts such as <a href="/joshua/19-10.htm">Joshua 19:10-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is the sister of Rachel.
