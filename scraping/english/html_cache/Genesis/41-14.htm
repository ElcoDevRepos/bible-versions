His decision to send for Joseph indicates the urgency and importance of the situation, as Pharaoh had experienced troubling dreams that none of his wise men could interpret. This moment marks a significant turning point in Joseph's life, as he transitions from a prisoner to a key figure in Egypt. The act of sending for Joseph also highlights God's providence and timing, as Joseph's ability to interpret dreams was about to be used for a greater purpose.<p><b>who was quickly brought out of the dungeon</b><br>Joseph's rapid removal from the dungeon underscores the urgency of Pharaoh's need. The dungeon, a place of confinement and suffering, symbolizes Joseph's trials and unjust imprisonment. His swift release can be seen as a divine intervention, aligning with the biblical theme of God delivering His people from bondage. This moment foreshadows the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt, as well as the resurrection of Christ from the grave, both instances of liberation from a place of death or captivity.<p><b>After he had shaved and changed his clothes</b><br>In ancient Egyptian culture, personal grooming and cleanliness were highly valued, especially in the presence of royalty. Shaving and changing clothes were necessary for Joseph to be presentable before Pharaoh, reflecting the cultural norms of the time. This transformation also symbolizes a change in status and identity, as Joseph prepares to step into a new role. The act of changing clothes can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal, akin to the New Testament concept of putting on the new self in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>).<p><b>he went in before Pharaoh</b><br>Joseph's entrance into Pharaoh's presence signifies his introduction to a new phase of his life, where he would play a crucial role in the history of Egypt and the survival of his own family. Standing before Pharaoh, Joseph is positioned to fulfill God's plan, reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood before kings, such as Daniel before Nebuchadnezzar. This moment also prefigures Christ's role as the mediator between God and humanity, as Joseph becomes the intermediary who brings God's revelation to Pharaoh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who had a troubling dream that none of his magicians or wise men could interpret.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was unjustly imprisoned in Egypt.

Now he is lifted up without delay, prefiguring how Christ was raised from the grave on the third day (<a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>) and how believers, too, are delivered &#8220;out of darkness into His marvelous light&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

On Egyptian monuments only captives and men of low condition are represented with beards. In the prison, therefore, Joseph would leave his beard untrimmed, but when summoned into the king's presence, he would shave it off. Abravanel notices that for each suffering of Joseph there was an exact recompense. It was for dreams that his brethren hated him, and by help of dreams he was exalted in Egypt. They stripped him of his many-coloured coat; the Egyptians clothed him in byssus. They cast him into a pit, and from the pit <span class= "ital">of </span>the prison he was drawn forth by Pharaoh.
