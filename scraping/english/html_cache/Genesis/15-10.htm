This act is part of a covenant ritual, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where parties would pass between the pieces of sacrificed animals to signify a binding agreement. This covenant is foundational for the Abrahamic promises, which include land, descendants, and blessings. It foreshadows the ultimate covenant fulfilled in Christ, who brings a new covenant through His sacrifice.<p><b>split each of them down the middle</b><br>The splitting of the animals signifies the seriousness of the covenant. In ancient times, this act symbolized that if either party broke the covenant, they would face a fate similar to the animals. This practice is seen in <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18-19</a>, where God references a similar ritual. The division of the animals can also be seen as a type of Christ's sacrifice, where His body was broken for the new covenant.<p><b>and laid the halves opposite each other</b><br>By laying the halves opposite each other, Abram sets the stage for the covenant ceremony. This arrangement creates a path between the pieces, which God will later pass through as a smoking firepot and a blazing torch, symbolizing His presence and commitment. This act signifies God's unilateral promise to Abram, emphasizing that the fulfillment of the covenant depends solely on God.<p><b>The birds, however, he did not cut in half</b><br>The birds, not being divided, may symbolize the completeness and unity of God's promise. In Levitical law, birds were often used in sacrifices for purification (<a href="/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4-7</a>), pointing to the cleansing and unifying work of Christ. The undivided birds could also represent the indivisibility of God's covenant with Abram, highlighting the eternal and unbreakable nature of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is in a covenant-making process with God.

This echoes his later obedience in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> when he rises &#8220;early in the morning&#8221; to obey another difficult command.<p>&#8226; The scene highlights personal engagement: Abram brings the animals &#8220;to Him,&#8221; standing face-to-face with the LORD in covenant-making intimacy (cf. <a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, where Moses sprinkles &#8220;the blood of the covenant&#8221; before the LORD and the people).<p>&#8226; Abram&#8217;s action underlines that faith embraces concrete steps; trusting God always shows up in real-world obedience (<a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Split each of them down the middle</b><p>&#8226; In the Ancient Near East a binding treaty was &#8220;cut&#8221;; the sacrificed animals symbolized the fate of anyone who broke the pact (<a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; By literally dividing the animals, Abram participates in a ceremony God Himself will complete in verse 17 when the &#8220;smoking firepot and flaming torch&#8221; pass between the pieces.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15-17</a> points to the necessity of death to ratify a covenant; here the shedding of blood prefigures Christ&#8217;s ultimate sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laid the halves opposite each other</b><p>&#8226; Abram arranges a pathway&#8212;two rows of flesh and blood.

The covenant&#8217;s certainty rests entirely on God&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture is solemn yet hopeful; every promise God makes is backed by His own life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The birds, however, he did not cut in half</b><p>&#8226; Smaller creatures were commonly presented whole; division was unnecessary for birds.<p>&#8226; The uncut birds still contribute blood, maintaining the theme of life poured out (<a href="/leviticus/1-14.htm">Leviticus 1:14-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Keeping them intact prevents needless mutilation, showing God&#8217;s instructions are both purposeful and measured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/15-10.htm">Genesis 15:10</a> portrays Abram&#8217;s careful obedience in preparing a covenant ceremony.

The divided pieces underscore the gravity of covenant; the uncut birds reveal thoughtful precision. Above all, the scene proclaims that the certainty of God&#8217;s word rests on God Himself, not on human strength or performance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took unto him all these, and divided</span> (a word occurring only here in Genesis, and supposed by Michaelis to have been taken by Moses from the ancient document from which he transcribed this portion of his work. The word is afterwards found in <a href="/songs/2-17.htm">Song of Solomon 2:17</a>, and <a href="/jeremiah/34-18.htm">Jeremiah 34:18</a>) them in the midst, - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.); in equal parts (Onkelos) - <span class="cmt_word">and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</span> So afterwards in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7</a>). Wordsworth detects in the non-dividing of the birds an emblem of "the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of peace and love; which is a Spirit of unity, and of "Christ's human spirit, which was not divisible." Kalisch, with more probability, recognizes as the reason of their not being divided the fact that such division was not required, both fowls being regarded as one part of the sacrifice only, and each, as the half, being placed opposite the other. Wordsworth numbers seven parts in the sacrifice, and sees a symbol of completeness and finality, the number seven being the root of <span class="accented">shaba</span>, to swear (Gesenius, p. 802); Kalisch reckons four, which he regards as "denoting perfection, but rather the external perfection of form than the internal one of the mind," and pointing "to the perfect possession of the Holy Land." The ritual here described is the same which was afterwards observed among the Hebrews in the formation of covenants (cf. <a href="/genesis/34-18.htm">Genesis 34:18</a>), and appears to have extensively prevailed among heathen nations (cf. ' Iliad,' b. 124, "<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>;" and the Latin phrase, "<span class="accented">foedus</span> icere"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/15-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Abram] brought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
