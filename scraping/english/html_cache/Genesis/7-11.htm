Noah's age reflects the antediluvian period's extended lifespans, which are documented in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>. This longevity is often interpreted as a sign of the pristine conditions of the early earth and humanity's initial state of grace before the fall and subsequent corruption.<p><b>on the seventeenth day of the second month</b><br>The specificity of the date underscores the historical nature of the flood narrative. The Hebrew calendar, which is lunar-based, places this event in the spring, a time often associated with new beginnings. This timing may symbolize a new beginning for creation post-flood. The precision of the date also serves to highlight the importance of the event in biblical history.<p><b>all the fountains of the great deep burst forth</b><br>This phrase suggests a cataclysmic event involving subterranean waters. The "fountains of the great deep" may refer to vast underground water reserves, which, when released, contributed to the floodwaters. This aligns with ancient Near Eastern cosmology, which often depicted the earth as resting on waters. The bursting forth signifies a divine intervention, as God uses creation itself to execute judgment.<p><b>and the floodgates of the heavens were opened</b><br>This imagery of the heavens opening complements the bursting of the deep, indicating a deluge from above and below. The "floodgates" suggest a controlled release of water, emphasizing God's sovereignty over creation. This dual source of water highlights the totality of the flood's impact. The opening of the heavens can also be seen as a reversal of the separation of waters in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, symbolizing a return to chaos as a result of human sin.<br><br>The flood narrative as a whole prefigures baptism, where water signifies both judgment and purification. It also foreshadows the eschatological judgment, as referenced in <a href="/2_peter/3-6.htm">2 Peter 3:6-7</a>, where the world is reserved for fire.
