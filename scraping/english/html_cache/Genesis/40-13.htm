The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine intervention, as seen in other scriptures such as Jonah's three days in the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).<p><b>Pharaoh will lift up your head</b><br>"Lifting up the head" is an idiomatic expression meaning to restore someone to their former status or position. In ancient Egyptian culture, the Pharaoh had absolute authority, and his decisions were seen as divinely sanctioned. This phrase foreshadows the cupbearer's restoration and contrasts with the baker's fate later in the chapter.<p><b>and restore your position</b><br>Restoration here implies a return to a previous state of favor and responsibility. The cupbearer&#8217;s role was significant, as he was responsible for the safety and quality of the Pharaoh's wine, a position of trust and intimacy with the king. This restoration can be seen as a type of redemption, reflecting themes of forgiveness and grace.<p><b>You will put Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand</b><br>This phrase highlights the cupbearer's duties, which included serving wine to the Pharaoh. The act of placing the cup in Pharaoh's hand signifies trust and the resumption of his official duties. This role was crucial in the royal court, as it involved both service and protection against potential poisoning.<p><b>just as you did when you were his cupbearer</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the return to a former state of service and trust. It suggests a reinstatement to a position of honor and reliability. The cupbearer's past service is acknowledged, indicating that his previous loyalty and competence are being recognized and rewarded. This mirrors the biblical theme of faithfulness being rewarded, as seen in parables like the faithful servant (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who was sold into slavery by his brothers and ended up in Egypt.

The God who numbered Joseph&#8217;s own days in prison also numbers Pharaoh&#8217;s days of decision, echoing the divine punctuality shown when Abraham&#8217;s visitors promised Isaac&#8217;s birth &#8220;at this time next year&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>) and when Jesus foretold His resurrection &#8220;after three days&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase assures the cupbearer that God&#8217;s intervention is imminent, reinforcing Joseph&#8217;s earlier confidence that &#8220;interpretations belong to God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The certainty of the timeline encourages believers to trust that the Lord moves on schedule, whether in delivering Israel at the Red Sea on &#8220;the very night&#8221; Pharaoh&#8217;s army pressed in (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>) or raising up Christ &#8220;on the third day&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-40.htm">Acts 10:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pharaoh will lift up your head</b><p>&#8226; To &#8220;lift up the head&#8221; is a royal gesture of both acknowledgment and favor. While the baker&#8217;s head will be lifted &#8220;from&#8221; him in judgment (<a href="/genesis/40-19.htm">Genesis 40:19</a>), the cupbearer&#8217;s head is lifted &#8220;up,&#8221; signaling pardon. Scripture often couples the act of lifting a head with restoration, as when the Lord is &#8220;the One who lifts my head&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>) and when Evil-merodach &#8220;lifted up the head of Jehoiachin&#8221; from prison (<a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise reveals that earthly authority, like Pharaoh&#8217;s, is ultimately held in God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>). Joseph&#8217;s prophetic word demonstrates that God can incline a ruler&#8217;s heart toward mercy in a moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and restore your position</b><p>&#8226; The cupbearer will be reinstated, underscoring God&#8217;s power to reverse circumstances. Such reversals appear throughout Genesis&#8212;Jacob replacing Esau (<a href="/bsb/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>), Joseph rising from pit to palace (<a href="/bsb/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>).<p>&#8226; Restoration also anticipates the larger biblical theme of God returning His people to lost standing, whether Israel coming back from exile (<a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>) or sinners being reconciled to the Father through Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The particular &#8220;position&#8221; matters: a cupbearer enjoyed intimate access to the throne, paralleling Nehemiah&#8217;s later role before Artaxerxes (<a href="/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>). Elevated proximity to power can serve God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will put Pharaoh&#8217;s cup in his hand</b><p>&#8226; The prophecy narrows from status to specific service. God&#8217;s word doesn&#8217;t stop with titles; it describes actions. Like Daniel interpreting Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s dreams and then governing provinces (<a href="/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48-49</a>), the cupbearer will tangibly resume his duties.<p>&#8226; Serving the king&#8217;s cup symbolizes trust; any hint of poison would doom the monarch. The scene recalls Solomon&#8217;s &#8220;cupbearers&#8221; whose presence stunned the Queen of Sheba (<a href="/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>). Trust restored here demonstrates that God can heal even broken confidences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as you did when you were his cupbearer</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promise returns the man to familiar rhythms, showing that divine intervention often redeems ordinary work rather than replacing it. Paul echoed this principle when urging believers to &#8220;remain in the situation&#8221; in which they were called (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-20.htm">1 Corinthians 7:20-24</a>) while serving Christ wholeheartedly (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures the cupbearer that the past, though marred by imprisonment, has not nullified his calling. Peter, forgiven by the risen Lord, returns to feeding sheep (<a href="/john/21-17.htm">John 21:17</a>); the cupbearer, forgiven by Pharaoh, returns to filling cups.<p>&#8226; Remembering previous faithfulness can encourage new faithfulness. The Lord who restored Job &#8220;to his former prosperity&#8221; (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>) also restores this steward to his former post.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a> promises a swift, divinely orchestrated reversal: within three days the cupbearer&#8217;s head will be lifted in favor, his rank reinstated, and his practical service resumed exactly as before. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereign timing, His authority over rulers, and His ability to restore both status and everyday vocation. Believers can take heart that the Lord who precisely fulfilled this word through Joseph still directs histories and personal stories with the same accuracy and grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/40-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Within</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;
