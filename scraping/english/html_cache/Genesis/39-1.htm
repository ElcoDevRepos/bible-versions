This phrase indicates a transition from his life in Canaan to a new chapter in Egypt. The term "down" reflects the geographical descent from the highlands of Canaan to the lower elevation of Egypt. This movement also symbolizes a descent into trials and tribulations, which God uses to fulfill His greater plan. Joseph's journey to Egypt foreshadows the later descent of the Israelites into Egypt, leading to their eventual enslavement and the Exodus.<p><b>where an Egyptian named Potiphar</b><br>Potiphar is introduced as a key figure in Joseph's life in Egypt. His name, likely of Egyptian origin, suggests a person of significant status and influence. Potiphar's role in the narrative sets the stage for Joseph's rise and fall within his household, which ultimately leads to Joseph's imprisonment and subsequent rise to power. Potiphar's position in Egyptian society provides insight into the hierarchical and bureaucratic nature of ancient Egypt.<p><b>an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard</b><br>Potiphar's titles indicate his high-ranking position in Pharaoh's court. As an officer and captain of the guard, Potiphar would have been responsible for the security of the Pharaoh and possibly involved in military or police functions. This highlights the level of trust and authority he held, making his household a place of significant influence. Joseph's placement in Potiphar's house is a strategic move in God's plan, positioning him close to the centers of power in Egypt.<p><b>bought him from the Ishmaelites</b><br>The mention of the Ishmaelites connects Joseph's story to the broader narrative of Abraham's descendants. The Ishmaelites, descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son by Hagar, were known as traders and caravan leaders. This transaction underscores the practice of slavery in the ancient Near East and the economic activities that connected different regions. Joseph's sale into slavery is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for his eventual rise to power in Egypt.<p><b>who had taken him there</b><br>The Ishmaelites' role in transporting Joseph to Egypt highlights the movement and trade routes of the ancient world. This phrase emphasizes the providential nature of Joseph's journey, as God uses the actions of others to bring about His purposes. Joseph's arrival in Egypt is not merely a result of human actions but part of a divine plan that will lead to the preservation of his family and the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, sold into slavery by his brothers.
