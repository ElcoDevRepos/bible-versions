This period reflects the deep respect and honor given to Jacob, not only by his family but also by the Egyptians. Mourning customs in ancient Egypt were elaborate, involving rituals and ceremonies that underscored the significance of the deceased. This extended mourning period also highlights the integration of Joseph into Egyptian society, as he adhered to their customs while maintaining his Hebrew identity.<p><b>Joseph said to Pharaoh&#8217;s court</b><br>Joseph, though second in command in Egypt, approaches Pharaoh's court rather than Pharaoh directly. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Egyptian governance, where even high-ranking officials often communicated through intermediaries. Joseph's approach demonstrates his respect for protocol and his understanding of the political dynamics at play. It also shows his humility and wisdom in navigating his dual identity as a Hebrew and an Egyptian leader.<p><b>If I have found favor in your eyes</b><br>This phrase indicates Joseph's reliance on the goodwill he has cultivated with Pharaoh and his court. It echoes similar language used throughout the Old Testament, where individuals seek favor from those in authority, such as Esther with King Xerxes or Nehemiah with King Artaxerxes. Joseph's request is couched in humility and respect, acknowledging the authority of Pharaoh while subtly reminding the court of his loyalty and service.<p><b>please tell Pharaoh that</b><br>Joseph's request to have his message conveyed to Pharaoh underscores the importance of proper channels of communication in ancient royal courts. It also reflects Joseph's strategic thinking, as he seeks to ensure that his request is presented in the most favorable light. This approach is consistent with Joseph's character throughout Genesis, where he consistently demonstrates wisdom, patience, and a deep understanding of human nature and political structures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt.

By telling us the days &#8220;had passed,&#8221; the text marks a clear transition from grief to responsible action&#8212;an example of <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a>, &#8220;a time to weep and a time to laugh.&#8221;<p>- Joseph models respect for both family and national customs. He did not rush God&#8217;s timing but waited until mourning was complete before seeking permission to leave for Canaan (compare <a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>, &#8220;a timely word&#8212;how good it is!&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph said to Pharaoh&#8217;s court</b><p>- Though second only to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>), Joseph approaches through officials rather than barging in. This shows humility and adherence to protocol (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> reminds believers to respect governing authorities).<p>- The term &#8220;court&#8221; points to the palace household&#8212;people who could relay messages. A similar scene unfolds in <a href="/esther/4-4.htm">Esther 4:4&#8211;5</a>, where Esther communicates through intermediaries because of protocol.<p>- Joseph&#8217;s deference protects Pharaoh&#8217;s dignity and maintains order, echoing <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>, &#8220;Honor the king,&#8221; while still pursuing obedience to his father&#8217;s final wish.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If I have found favor in your eyes</b><p>- This is a gracious, customary phrase (see <a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>; <a href="/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>) expressing humility and dependence on another&#8217;s kindness. Even wielding great authority, Joseph acknowledges his position under Pharaoh&#8212;an attitude mirrored in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, &#8220;in humility consider others as more important than yourselves.&#8221;<p>- Favor ultimately rests in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>), yet Joseph rightly seeks human approval for a civic matter. The blend of divine trust and earthly courtesy provides a balanced model for believers navigating secular structures.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>please tell Pharaoh that</b><p>- Joseph&#8217;s continued use of intermediaries may reflect ongoing mourning-related ceremonial uncleanness (compare <a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11&#8211;13</a>) or palace protocol forbidding mourners direct access.<p>- Delegating the request ensures clarity and formality. In <a href="/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1&#8211;5</a>, a similar respectful request is made to a king before undertaking a mission tied to family heritage.<p>- The phrase also introduces the content of Joseph&#8217;s appeal in verses 5&#8211;6: permission to bury Jacob in Canaan. His approach shows integrity&#8212;honoring his father (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) without neglecting his duty to Pharaoh.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/50-4.htm">Genesis 50:4</a> captures a pivotal moment of respectful transition. After fulfilling the full, culturally appropriate mourning period, Joseph carefully approaches Pharaoh&#8217;s household, humbly seeks favor, and prepares to request leave to bury his father. The verse highlights Joseph&#8217;s balance of family loyalty, submission to authority, and God-honoring humility&#8212;an enduring example for believers navigating grief, duty, and respectful communication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/50.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh.</span>--It may seem at first sight strange that Joseph should make his request through mediators, but probably no one in the attire of mourning might enter the royal presence. (Comp. <a href="/esther/4-2.htm" title="And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.">Esther 4:2</a>.) The dress of a mourner was squalid, his beard unshorn, his hair in disorder, and while these outward signs of grief were maintained, he was also expected to confine himself to his own house.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/50.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh,</span> - that Joseph did not address himself directly to Pharaoh, but through the members of the royal household, was not owing to the circumstance that, being arrayed in mourning apparel, he could not come before the king (Rosenm&uuml;ller), since it is not certain that this Persian custom (<a href="/esther/4-2.htm">Esther 4:2</a>) prevailed in Egypt, but is supposed to have been due, either to a desire on Joseph's part to put himself on a good understanding with the priesthood who composed the courtly circle, since the interment of the dead was closely connected with the religious beliefs of Egypt (Havernick), or, what was more likely, to the fact that Joseph, having, according to Egyptian custom (Herod. 2:36), allowed his beard and hair to <span class="accented">grow</span>, could not enter the king's presence without being both shaven and shorn (Hengstenberg, Kurtz, Keil). It has been suggested (Kalisch) that Joseph's power may have been restricted after the expiration of the famine, or that another Pharaoh may have succeeded to the throne who was not so friendly as his predecessor with the grand vizier of the realm; but such conjectures are not required to render Joseph's conduct in this matter perfectly intelligible - <span class="cmt_word">saying, My father made me swear</span> (<a href="/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">saying</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> my father saying), <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me</span> - not bought (Onkelos, Drusius, Ainsworth, Bohlen, and others), but digged, <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">fodi</span> (Vulgate).
