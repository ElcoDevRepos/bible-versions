According to the Hebrew, the total number of years from Shem to the birth of Abram was 390, according to the Samaritan, 1,040, and according to the LXX., 1,270. These larger totals are obtained by adding, as a rule, one hundred years to the age of each patriarch before the birth of his eldest son, and the LXX. also insert Cainan between Arphaxad and Salah. The virtual agreement of two authorities, coming from such different quarters as the Samaritan transcript and the LXX. version is remarkable, but scholars have long acknowledged that these genealogies were never intended for chronological purposes, and that so to employ them leads only to error.<p>Like the genealogy of Seth, in Genesis 5, the <span class= "ital">Toldoth Shem </span>also consists of ten generations, and thus forms, according to Hebrew ideas respecting the number ten, a perfect representation of the race. With the exception of Arphaxad (for whom see <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), the names in this genealogy are all Hebrew words, and are full of meaning.

The English term is borrowed from the LXX., the Hebrew being Arpaehshadh, a compound of which the principal part is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>, giving rise to the Chashdim or Chaldeans; whence Professor Lewis regards it as originally the name of a people transferred to their ancestor (cf. <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Two years after the flood.</span> So that in Noah's 603rd year Shem was 100, and must accordingly have been born in Noah's 503rd year, i.e. two years after Japheth (cf. <a href="/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; <a href="/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>). The mention of the Flood indicates the point of time from which the present section is designed to be reckoned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1434;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the account</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;wl&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8435.htm">Strong's 8435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Descent, family, history</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Shem.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8035.htm">Strong's 8035: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shem -- 'name', oldest son of Noah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Two years</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the flood,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mab&#183;b&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
