This figure appears multiple times in the Old Testament, often delivering messages or providing guidance. In this context, the angel's appearance signifies divine intervention and care for Hagar, an Egyptian maidservant. The angel of the LORD is seen in other key biblical moments, such as with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a> and Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, indicating a consistent divine presence and authority.<p><b>found Hagar</b><br>Hagar, an Egyptian servant of Sarai, is fleeing from her mistress due to mistreatment. Her story highlights themes of God's concern for the marginalized and oppressed. The use of "found" suggests that God actively seeks out those in distress, emphasizing His omniscience and compassion. Hagar's encounter with the divine is significant as it marks one of the few instances where God directly communicates with a woman in the Old Testament.<p><b>by a spring of water in the desert</b><br>The setting of a spring in the desert is symbolic of life and sustenance in a barren place. Water often represents spiritual refreshment and divine provision in Scripture. This location underscores God's ability to provide for Hagar in her time of need, reflecting His provision for Israel in the wilderness and foreshadowing Jesus as the "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>.<p><b>the spring along the road to Shur</b><br>The road to Shur indicates a route leading back to Egypt, suggesting Hagar's intention to return to her homeland. Shur is a region on the northeastern border of Egypt, often associated with wilderness and desolation. This geographical detail situates the narrative within a real historical context, providing insight into the ancient Near Eastern world. The mention of Shur also connects to later biblical narratives, such as the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger often seen as a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, who delivers God's messages and guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian maidservant of Sarai (later Sarah), who becomes the mother of Ishmael.
