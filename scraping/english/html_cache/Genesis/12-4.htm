This act of leaving his homeland is a significant step in the unfolding of God's covenant with Abram, which includes the promise of making him a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). Abram's obedience is later echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>, which highlights his faith in going to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, even though he did not know where he was going. This departure is a type of Christ, who also left His heavenly home to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and Lot went with him</b><br>Lot, Abram's nephew, accompanies him on this journey. This detail sets the stage for future narratives involving Lot, including his eventual settlement in Sodom and the subsequent rescue by Abram (Genesis 14). Lot's presence also foreshadows the division of land between him and Abram, which is a precursor to the fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Abram's descendants. The relationship between Abram and Lot can be seen as a reflection of familial loyalty and the complexities that arise from shared inheritance.<p><b>Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran</b><br>Abram's age at the time of departure underscores the theme of divine timing and the fulfillment of God's promises. At seventy-five, Abram is called to begin a new chapter in his life, which challenges cultural norms regarding age and productivity. This age also highlights the miraculous nature of God's promise to give Abram descendants, as he and his wife Sarai were beyond typical childbearing years. The mention of Haran connects to Abram's family history, as it was a significant location where his father, Terah, had settled (<a href="/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>). Haran serves as a transitional place in Abram's journey of faith, symbolizing a departure from the past and a step toward the fulfillment of God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

(See <a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>.)<p>&#8226; True faith acts. Abram&#8217;s feet moved because his heart trusted. James later ties such obedience to genuine belief (<a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21-23</a>).<p>&#8226; By stepping out, Abram began the journey that would shape redemptive history, leading ultimately to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the LORD had directed him</b><p>&#8226; The initiative was entirely the Lord&#8217;s; Abram&#8217;s role was to follow.
