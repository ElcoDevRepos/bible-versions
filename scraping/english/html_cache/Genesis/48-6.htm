Jacob, also known as Israel, is adopting Ephraim and Manasseh as his own, granting them equal status with his other sons. This adoption is significant because it elevates Joseph's sons to the status of tribal patriarchs, each becoming the head of a tribe of Israel. This act reflects the cultural practice of adoption in ancient Near Eastern societies, where adopted sons could receive inheritance rights. It also underscores the importance of lineage and inheritance in the biblical narrative, as these sons are integrated into the covenant promises given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and they shall be called by the names of their brothers</b><br>Here, Jacob is specifying that any future children of Joseph will not form separate tribes but will be incorporated into the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. This reflects the importance of tribal identity and inheritance in Israelite society. The naming of tribes after Ephraim and Manasseh rather than Joseph himself highlights the unique status of these two sons. This also foreshadows the significant roles that the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will play in the history of Israel, with Ephraim often representing the northern kingdom in later biblical texts.<p><b>in the territory they inherit</b><br>The mention of territory emphasizes the tangible aspect of the inheritance, which is not just a spiritual promise but also a physical land. This ties back to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham's descendants a specific land. The allocation of land to the tribes of Israel is a central theme in the book of Joshua, where the land is divided among the tribes. The inheritance of land is a fulfillment of God's promises and a crucial element of Israel's identity as a nation. This phrase also points to the future settlement in Canaan, where the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh will receive their portions, as detailed in <a href="/joshua/16.htm">Joshua 16 and 17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch who is blessing his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh, and discussing the inheritance of Joseph's future children.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's son, who is in Egypt and has brought his sons to be blessed by Jacob.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim_and_manasseh.htm">Ephraim and Manasseh</a></b><br>Joseph's sons, who are being adopted by Jacob as his own, thus receiving a share in the inheritance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph and his family are residing during the famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>The division of land and blessings among the tribes of Israel, which is a significant theme in the account of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/adoption_into_god's_family.htm">Adoption into God's Family</a></b><br>Just as Jacob adopts Ephraim and Manasseh, believers are adopted into God's family through faith in Christ.
