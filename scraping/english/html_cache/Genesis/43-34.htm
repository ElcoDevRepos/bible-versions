Joseph, now a powerful Egyptian official, extends this gesture to his brothers, indicating a shift from their previous estrangement. The act of serving from Joseph's table signifies his authority and generosity. This moment foreshadows the reconciliation and restoration of familial relationships, reminiscent of the prodigal son&#8217;s feast in <a href="/luke/15-22.htm">Luke 15:22-24</a>.<p><b>Benjamin&#8217;s portion was five times larger than any of the others</b><br>The number five in biblical numerology often symbolizes grace. Benjamin, Joseph's full brother, receives a portion five times larger, highlighting Joseph's special affection for him. This act tests the brothers' jealousy, reminiscent of their earlier envy towards Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>). It also prefigures the grace and favor shown by God to His chosen people, as seen in the blessings given to Israel.<p><b>So they feasted and drank freely with Joseph</b><br>The brothers' ability to feast and drink freely with Joseph indicates a moment of peace and acceptance. In the context of the narrative, this scene contrasts with their earlier fear and guilt (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21-22</a>). It symbolizes the breaking down of barriers and the beginning of reconciliation. This fellowship meal can be seen as a type of the Messianic banquet, where all are invited to partake in the joy and abundance of God's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The governor of Egypt, who was once sold into slavery by his brothers.
