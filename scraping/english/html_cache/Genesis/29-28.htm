This reflects his commitment and determination, despite the deception he faced. Jacob's perseverance is reminiscent of his earlier determination to obtain Esau's birthright and blessing, highlighting a recurring theme of striving and persistence in his life.<p><b>He finished the week&#8217;s celebration,</b><br>The "week's celebration" refers to the customary wedding feast, which typically lasted seven days in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This period was a time of joy and festivity, but for Jacob, it was also a time of tension and anticipation, knowing he was working towards marrying Rachel, whom he loved. This cultural practice is seen in other biblical accounts, such as Samson's wedding feast in <a href="/judges/14.htm">Judges 14</a>.<p><b>and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.</b><br>Laban's giving of Rachel to Jacob fulfills the promise made after Jacob completed the additional seven years of service. This act is significant as it marks the culmination of Jacob's long pursuit of Rachel, whom he loved deeply. The giving of Rachel also sets the stage for the complex family dynamics that follow, including the rivalry between Leah and Rachel, which plays a crucial role in the narrative of the twelve tribes of Israel. Rachel's eventual role as the mother of Joseph and Benjamin ties into the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the unfolding of His plan for the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob is a central figure in this account.

Abravanel says that as Esau ought to have married Leah, and Jacob Rachel, he acted only as his brother's substitute in taking the elder, and was still free to marry the younger sister, who was his by custom, He thinks also that Jacob, recalling the promise of a. seed numerous as the dust (<a href="/genesis/28-14.htm" title="And your seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in you and in your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.">Genesis 28:14</a>), and seeing how near the family had been to total extinction in the days of his father and grandfather, desired to place it on a more secure basis. More probably, even after Leah had been forced upon him, Jacob regarded Rachel as his own, and as polygamy was not actually forbidden, considered that he was only acting justly by her and himself in marrying her. He had seen Esau blamed, not for marrying two wives, but for taking Hittites; and his love for Rachel would make him need but little argument. The only other alternative, namely, to have divorced Leah, would have been worse, and happily divorce was not a practice as yet introduced.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob aid so, and fulfilled her week</span>.
