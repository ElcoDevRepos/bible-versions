This individual brings news to Abram, highlighting Abram's growing reputation and influence. The designation "Abram the Hebrew" is significant as it is the first use of "Hebrew" in the Bible, possibly derived from "Eber," an ancestor of Abram, or indicating a social or ethnic group. This term sets Abram apart from the surrounding peoples and foreshadows the identity of his descendants, the Israelites. The report to Abram underscores his role as a leader and protector, a type of Christ who intercedes and rescues.<p><b>Now Abram was living near the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite,</b><br>The Oaks of Mamre, also known as the terebinths, are located near Hebron, a significant site in biblical history. This area becomes a central location for Abram, where he builds an altar to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). The mention of Mamre the Amorite indicates a local chieftain or clan leader, suggesting Abram's integration and influence within the region. The Amorites were a prominent people in Canaan, and Abram's association with them shows his strategic alliances and peaceful coexistence with local tribes, reflecting wisdom and diplomacy.<p><b>a brother of Eshcol and Aner,</b><br>Eshcol and Aner, along with Mamre, are mentioned as allies of Abram. These individuals are likely leaders of their respective clans or regions. Their brotherhood may indicate a familial or tribal connection, emphasizing the importance of kinship and alliances in ancient Near Eastern culture. This alliance with local leaders demonstrates Abram's ability to form strategic partnerships, which would be crucial in the upcoming rescue mission for Lot. It also reflects the broader theme of God's providence in providing Abram with allies.<p><b>all of whom were bound by treaty to Abram.</b><br>The treaty or covenant mentioned here signifies a formal agreement, likely involving mutual protection and support. Such treaties were common in the ancient world, providing security and fostering cooperation among different groups. This alliance is pivotal in the narrative, as it enables Abram to muster a force to rescue Lot. The concept of covenant is central to biblical theology, prefiguring the covenants God makes with His people. Abram's alliances foreshadow the unity and cooperation expected among God's people, and his role as a peacemaker and leader points to the ultimate peace and leadership found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram_the_hebrew.htm">Abram the Hebrew</a></b><br>Abram, later known as Abraham, is a central figure in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

This location, near Hebron, becomes a long-term base; it later hosts the divine visitation (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>) and stands near the family burial cave at Machpelah (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Mamre the Amorite&#8221; is both a place name and the local chieftain who controls the region. Abram settles among Canaanites yet remains distinct in faith (<a href="/hebrews/11-9.htm">Hebrews 11:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting reminds us God plants His people where their obedience can shine amid pagan surroundings (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a brother of Eshcol and Aner</b><p>&#8226; Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner are introduced as brothers&#8212;likely clan leaders connected by blood or covenant.

Abram&#8217;s location, reputation, and pre-existing treaty all set the stage for the bold rescue of Lot.
