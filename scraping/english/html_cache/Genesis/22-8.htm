This moment is a test of Abraham's faith, as God had commanded him to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham's answer demonstrates his belief that God will intervene, a theme consistent with his previous experiences of God's faithfulness.<p><b>God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering</b><br>This statement is prophetic, foreshadowing God's provision of a substitute sacrifice. In the immediate context, God provides a ram caught in a thicket (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>). Theologically, this points to the ultimate provision of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), who takes away the sin of the world. The concept of substitutionary atonement is central to Christian theology, where Christ is seen as the sacrificial lamb provided by God for humanity's sins.<p><b>my son</b><br>The phrase "my son" emphasizes the personal and emotional nature of the test. Isaac is not only Abraham's son but also the child of promise through whom God had promised to establish a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>). This highlights the depth of Abraham's faith, as he is willing to sacrifice his beloved son, trusting in God's promise and provision.<p><b>And the two walked on together</b><br>This phrase underscores the unity and trust between Abraham and Isaac. Despite the gravity of the situation, they proceed together, symbolizing obedience and faith. The narrative does not record any further questioning from Isaac, suggesting his trust in his father and, by extension, in God's plan. This unity can also be seen as a type of the relationship between God the Father and Jesus, who willingly went to the cross in obedience to the Father's will (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

His words come in the midst of a test (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1&#8211;2</a>), yet they carry calm assurance&#8212;as seen later in <a href="/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17&#8211;19</a>, where Abraham&#8217;s confidence in God&#8217;s power to raise the dead is highlighted.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a> assures that the mind stayed on the LORD is kept in perfect peace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God Himself will provide</b><p>&#8226; The phrase shifts the focus from human effort to divine initiative&#8212;God is not merely helping Abraham;
