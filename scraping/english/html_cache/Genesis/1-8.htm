The act of naming in ancient Near Eastern cultures often signified dominion and understanding. The Hebrew word for "expanse" is "raqia," which can also be translated as "firmament." This term suggests a vast, stretched-out space, separating the waters above from the waters below, as described in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-7</a>. The concept of the sky as a dome or firmament was common in ancient cosmology, reflecting the understanding of the universe at the time. The sky is a testament to God's creative power and order, setting the stage for the life that will inhabit the earth. This naming also connects to other scriptural references where God demonstrates His control over the heavens, such as in <a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>, which declares the heavens as proclaiming the glory of God.<p><b>And there was evening, and there was morning&#8212;the second day.</b><br>The phrase "there was evening, and there was morning" establishes the pattern of a day in the creation account. This sequence emphasizes the orderly process of creation, with each day having a distinct beginning and end. The use of "evening" and "morning" suggests a literal day, reinforcing the rhythm and structure God instills in creation. The mention of the "second day" indicates the progression and unfolding of God's creative work. This day marks the completion of the separation of waters and the establishment of the sky, preparing the environment for the subsequent acts of creation. The repetition of this phrase throughout <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> underscores the intentionality and purposefulness of God's actions. It also foreshadows the Sabbath rest on the seventh day, highlighting the importance of rest and completion in God's design.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is actively involved in the formation of the universe.

In <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.">Genesis 1:1</a>, "the heaven" may include the abysmal regions of space; here it means the atmosphere round our earth, which, at a distance of about forty-five miles from the surface, melts away into the imponderable ether. The work of the second day is not described as being good, though the LXX. add this usual formula. Probably, however, the work of the second and third days is regarded as one. In both there was a separation of waters; but it was only when the open expanse reached the earth's surface, and reduced its temperature, that water could exist in any other form than that of vapour. But no sooner did it exist in a fluid form than the pressure of the atmosphere would make it seek the lowest level. The cooling, moreover, of the earth's surface would produce cracks and fissures, into which the waters would descend, and when these processes were well advanced, then at the end of the third day "God saw that it was good."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God called the firmament heaven</span>. Literally, the heights, <span class="accented">shamayim</span>, as in ver. 1. "This," says Principal Dawson, "may be regarded as an intimation that no definite barrier separates our film of atmosphere from the boundless abyss of heaven without;" and how appropriate the designation "heights" is, as applied to the atmosphere, we are reminded by science, which informs us that, after rising to the height of forty-five miles above the earth, it becomes imperceptible, and loses itself in the universal ether with which it is surrounded. <span class="cmt_word">And the evening and the morning were the second day.</span> For the literal rendering of this clause see on ver. 5, It is observable that in connection with the second day's work the usual formula, "And God saw that it was good," is omitted. The "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of the Septuagint is unsupported by any ancient version. The conceit of the Rabbis, that an expression of the Divine approbation was omitted because on this day the angels fell, requires no refutation. Aben Ezra accounts for its omission by making the second day's work terminate with ver. 10. Lange asks, "Had the prophetic author some anticipation that the blue vault was merely an appearance, whilst the sarans of the Septuagint had no such anticipation, and therefore proceeded to doctor the passage?" The explanation of Calvin, Delitzsch, Macdonald, and Alford, though declared by Kalisch to be of no weight, is probably the correct one, that the work begun on the second day was not properly terminated till the middle of the third, at which place, accordingly, the expression of Divine approbation is introduced (see ver. 10). <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1447;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
