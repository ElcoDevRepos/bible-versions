In the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern weddings, the bride would have been heavily veiled, and the festivities would have taken place at night, making it easier for Laban to substitute Leah for Rachel. This deception mirrors Jacob's own earlier deception of his father Isaac, when he disguised himself as Esau to receive the blessing. The principle of "reaping what you sow" is evident here, as Jacob experiences a similar deceit.<p><b>&#8220;What have you done to me?&#8221;</b><br>Jacob's question to Laban reflects his sense of betrayal and injustice. This moment is pivotal in Jacob's life, as it marks a turning point where he begins to understand the consequences of deceit. The question also underscores the personal nature of the betrayal, as Jacob had trusted Laban, his uncle and future father-in-law. This familial betrayal would have been particularly painful, highlighting the complex dynamics within family relationships in biblical narratives.<p><b>Jacob said to Laban.</b><br>Jacob addressing Laban directly indicates a confrontation that was necessary to address the wrong done to him. Laban, as the head of the household, held significant authority, and Jacob's direct approach shows his desperation and need for answers. This interaction sets the stage for the ongoing tension between Jacob and Laban, which continues throughout their relationship.<p><b>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it for Rachel that I served you?</b><br>Jacob's service for Rachel was a labor of love, as he had agreed to work for seven years to marry her. This phrase emphasizes the depth of Jacob's commitment and the extent of his disappointment. The concept of serving for a bride is rooted in the cultural practices of the time, where a bride price or service was often required. Jacob's willingness to serve for Rachel highlights the value he placed on her and the sincerity of his intentions.<p><b>Why have you deceived me?&#8221;</b><br>The theme of deception is central to this narrative, as it reflects the broader biblical theme of human fallibility and the consequences of sin. Jacob's question to Laban echoes the deception he himself practiced earlier in his life, creating a parallel that invites reflection on the nature of deceit and its repercussions. This moment also foreshadows future events in Jacob's life, where he will continue to encounter challenges and learn from his experiences. The question underscores the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by biblical characters and invites readers to consider the importance of integrity and honesty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob is a central figure in this account.

God often uses the light of a new day to reveal what darkness tries to hide (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>; <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God&#8217;s providence moves steadily forward; the dawn never surprises Him (<a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing this temporal marker first, Scripture stresses how swiftly consequences can replace celebration&#8212;echoing Jacob&#8217;s earlier night vision at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There was Leah!</b><p>&#8226; The exclamation captures Jacob&#8217;s shock. He expected Rachel but found Leah, a reversal that underscores the theme of the unexpected firstborn (cf. <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob had once disguised himself to deceive Isaac (<a href="/genesis/27-15.htm">Genesis 27:15&#8211;23</a>); now another disguise deceives him. &#8220;God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Leah&#8217;s presence also displays God&#8217;s sovereignty: though unwanted by Jacob, she becomes the mother of Judah and ultimately of Messiah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What have you done to me?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s first words mirror Esau&#8217;s anguished cry years earlier (<a href="/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>). The deceiver tastes his own medicine.<p>&#8226; Pain often awakens conscience. This question signals the divine lesson that sin&#8217;s ripple effects return to the sender (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God disciplines to transform, not destroy (<a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>). This moment begins Jacob&#8217;s reshaping into Israel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jacob said to Laban</b><p>&#8226; Scripture records the confrontation, showing the rightness of addressing wrongdoing directly (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob appeals to covenant expectations rather than violence, modeling lawful protest (<a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38&#8211;42</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene prepares us for later disputes over wages, proving that unresolved deception breeds further conflict (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it for Rachel that I served you?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Seven years of labor were a bridal price, a tangible covenant (<a href="/genesis/29-20.htm">Genesis 29:20</a>). Jacob emphasizes the justice of receiving what was promised (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>).<p>&#8226; His words spotlight faithful service: Jacob worked &#8220;for love of her,&#8221; a picture of persevering devotion (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also highlights the value Scripture places on clear commitments and the integrity to honor them (<a href="/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why have you deceived me?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jacob names the sin plainly&#8212;deceit.

Morning light exposes Laban&#8217;s treachery, Leah&#8217;s unexpected role in redemption, and God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to shape Jacob&#8217;s character. The verse teaches that sin&#8217;s consequences are certain, promises must be honored, and God&#8217;s sovereign plan advances even through human failure, ultimately pointing to the Messiah who would come through this very broken family line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, that in the morning, Behold, it was Leah.</span> If Jacob's deception, even with the veiled bride, may still be difficult to understand, it is easy to perceive in Leah's substitution for Rachel a clear instance of Divine retribution for the imposition he had practiced on his father. So the Lord oftentimes rewards evil-doers <span class="accented">according</span> to their wickedness (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he said to Laban</span> (who, Calvin conjectures, had given Jacob a splendid entertainment the night before to make him say nothing about the fraud), <span class="cmt_word">What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</span> It says much for Jacob that he did not seek to repudiate the marriage. Perhaps he saw the hand of God in what had happened, and probably considered that though he had chosen Rachel, God had selected Leah as his wife. If so, it must be set to Jacob's credit that at the call of God, thus providentially addressed to him, he was prepared to sacrifice his best affections to the claims of religion and duty. It is not Jacob, but Laban, who proposes that he should also marry Rachel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/29-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When morning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
