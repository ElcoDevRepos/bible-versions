This phrase marks a moment of negotiation between Laban and Jacob, where Laban consents to Jacob's terms regarding the division of the flocks. Historically, Laban is known for his cunning and manipulative behavior, as seen in previous chapters where he deceived Jacob into marrying Leah before Rachel. This agreement is part of a larger narrative of Laban's interactions with Jacob, which are characterized by a mix of familial ties and self-interest. The term "agreed" indicates a temporary alignment of interests, but given Laban's history, it also foreshadows potential future conflicts or deceit.<p><b>&#8220;Let it be as you have said.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects Laban's verbal commitment to the terms set by Jacob, which involved separating the speckled and spotted livestock as Jacob's wages. In the cultural and historical context of the time, verbal agreements were binding and held significant weight, often serving as the primary means of contract. The phrase also highlights the importance of spoken word in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where oaths and promises were taken seriously. This moment can be seen as a turning point in Jacob's journey, as it sets the stage for God's continued blessing and fulfillment of His promises to Jacob. Theologically, it underscores the theme of divine providence and the unfolding of God's plan, despite human manipulation and deceit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and husband to Leah and Rachel.

Yet because &#8220;the LORD reigns forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/146-10.htm">Psalm 146:10</a>), His plan is never at risk.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;said Laban.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Moses highlights the speaker to keep Laban&#8217;s character in view. Earlier he deceived Jacob on the wedding night (<a href="/genesis/29-25.htm">Genesis 29:25</a>) and would soon alter Jacob&#8217;s wages repeatedly (<a href="/genesis/31-41.htm">Genesis 31:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s words contrast with God&#8217;s words: one is unreliable, the other is utterly faithful (<a href="/psalms/119-160.htm">Psalm 119:160</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a> warns of a &#8220;double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.&#8221; Laban personifies that instability.<p>&#8226; By naming him again, the text urges us to discern between the voice of self-interest and the voice of the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let it be&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This is a formal ratification. In the culture of the Patriarchs, spoken agreements carried legal weight (cf. <a href="/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16&#8211;18</a> with Abraham&#8217;s purchase of Machpelah).<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes God&#8217;s own creative decree&#8212;&#8220;Let there be light&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). Laban can utter &#8220;let it be,&#8221; but only God can guarantee the outcome.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:5</a> cautions, &#8220;It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not fulfill it.&#8221; Laban&#8217;s affirmation makes him accountable before both Jacob and God.<p>&#8226; For believers, a simple &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>) honors God far more than elaborate promises we do not intend to keep.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;as you have said.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Laban ties the agreement specifically to Jacob&#8217;s proposal: only the speckled, spotted, and dark-colored animals will belong to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; By anchoring the terms to Jacob&#8217;s words, God leaves no room for later dispute; when the flocks multiply supernaturally, the credit is unmistakably divine (<a href="/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors Mary&#8217;s response to Gabriel&#8212;&#8220;May it be to me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>). God&#8217;s promises, when received in faith, unleash His power.<p>&#8226; The statement also foreshadows judgment on any future tampering. In <a href="/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44&#8211;49</a>, Laban and Jacob erect a heap of stones as a witness that neither will cross to harm the other, underscoring the seriousness of spoken covenants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Laban&#8217;s agreeable words in <a href="/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34</a> appear straightforward, but the context exposes mixed motives and sets the stage for God to display faithful provision. Each phrase underscores key truths: human consent cannot thwart divine purpose; words reveal character; vows carry weight; and God vindicates those who trust Him. The Lord&#8217;s integrity ensures that Jacob&#8217;s flocks&#8212;and our own lives&#8212;are ultimately secured not by human dealings but by His unwavering promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.</span> Jacob s chances of obtaining speckled animals by this arrangement were so small that Laban, with his customary selfishness, had no difficulty in closing with the offered bargain. As originally proposed by Jacob it seems to have been an honest desire on his part to commit the question of wages to the decision rather of God's providence than of his kiss-man's greed. That at this time Jacob's mind "had already formed the whole fraudulent procedure by which he acquired his wealth" (Kalisch) does not accord with the statement subsequently made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/30-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Agreed,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1425;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Laban.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3837.htm">Strong's 3837: </a> </span><span class="str2">Laban -- father-in-law of Jacob</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Let it be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as you have said.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1462;&#1469;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;i&#7695;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;re&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/30-34.htm">OT Law: Genesis 30:34 Laban said Behold I desire it (Gen.
