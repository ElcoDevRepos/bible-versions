Egypt, a powerful and fertile nation, was a place of refuge during times of famine. The phrase echoes God's promise to Abraham about his descendants being blessed and having a place to dwell. It also reflects the providence of God in providing for His people through Joseph's position in Egypt.<p><b>settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land.</b><br>Pharaoh's offer to settle Joseph's family in the best part of the land demonstrates favor and respect towards Joseph. The "best part" likely refers to the fertile region of Goshen, which was ideal for agriculture and livestock. This act of kindness fulfills God's promise to care for Jacob's family and foreshadows Israel's future prosperity in Egypt before the Exodus.<p><b>They may dwell in the land of Goshen.</b><br>Goshen was located in the eastern part of the Nile Delta, known for its rich soil and suitability for grazing. This location allowed the Israelites to maintain their distinct identity and practices, separate from the Egyptians. The choice of Goshen also aligns with God's plan to grow the Israelites into a great nation in a foreign land, as foretold to Abraham.<p><b>And if you know of any talented men among them,</b><br>Pharaoh's request for skilled men among Joseph's family highlights the value placed on talent and ability. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using individuals' skills and gifts for His purposes. It also suggests that the Israelites were known for their abilities, which would later be seen in their contributions to Egyptian society and their own community.<p><b>put them in charge of my own livestock.&#8221;</b><br>This directive shows Pharaoh's trust in Joseph's family and their expertise in livestock management. It also indicates the importance of livestock in Egypt's economy and daily life. This responsibility given to the Israelites foreshadows their future role as shepherds and leaders, and it parallels the way God entrusts His people with responsibilities to fulfill His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who grants Joseph's family the best part of the land to settle in.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob who has risen to a position of power in Egypt and is responsible for bringing his family to Egypt during the famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, father of Joseph, and his family is seeking refuge in Egypt due to famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/goshen.htm">Goshen</a></b><br>The fertile region in Egypt where Pharaoh allows Joseph's family to settle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who come to Egypt with their families and are given the opportunity to settle in Goshen.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Provision and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in providing for Jacob's family through Joseph's position in Egypt.
