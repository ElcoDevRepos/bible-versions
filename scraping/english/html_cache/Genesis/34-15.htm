In the context of <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, the sons of Jacob are responding to Shechem and Hamor's request for Dinah to marry Shechem after he defiled her. The condition set by Jacob's sons is strategic, reflecting their intent to deceive. This reflects the broader biblical theme of covenant and conditions, reminiscent of God's covenants with humanity, which often include stipulations or signs, such as the rainbow with Noah or circumcision with Abraham.<p><b>that you become circumcised like us</b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham, marking the Israelites as God's chosen people (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). By demanding circumcision, Jacob's sons are ostensibly asking the Shechemites to become part of their community and faith. However, their true intent is deceitful, as they plan to use this as a means to weaken and attack the Shechemites. This reflects the tension between outward religious rites and inward faithfulness, a theme echoed in the prophets and the New Testament, where true circumcision is of the heart (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>).<p><b>every one of your males</b><br>This requirement for all males to be circumcised emphasizes the communal aspect of the covenant sign. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such a demand would have been significant, as it involved a painful and personal commitment. The demand for all males to undergo circumcision also highlights the severity of the sons' deception, as it involves the entire community of Shechem. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of collective identity and responsibility, seen in the communal aspects of Israel's covenant relationship with God and the collective consequences of sin and obedience throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dinah.htm">Dinah</a></b><br>The daughter of Jacob and Leah, whose defilement by Shechem sets the stage for the events in <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shechem.htm">Shechem</a></b><br>The son of Hamor the Hivite, who defiles Dinah and seeks to marry her.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, who negotiates with Jacob's sons for Dinah's hand in marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_sons.htm">Jacob's Sons</a></b><br>Particularly Simeon and Levi, who deceitfully propose circumcision as a condition for intermarriage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>A significant religious and cultural practice for the Israelites, symbolizing their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_covenantal_identity.htm">The Importance of Covenantal Identity</a></b><br>Circumcision was a sign of the covenant with God, reminding believers of their distinct identity and calling.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/deception_and_its_consequences.htm">Deception and Its Consequences</a></b><br>The deceitful proposal by Jacob's sons leads to violence and further conflict, illustrating the destructive nature of deceit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_and_spiritual_boundaries.htm">Cultural and Spiritual Boundaries</a></b><br>The demand for circumcision underscores the tension between maintaining spiritual distinctiveness and engaging with surrounding cultures.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_righteousness_in_relationships.htm">The Role of Righteousness in Relationships</a></b><br>The passage challenges believers to consider how righteousness and integrity should guide their interactions and agreements.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_forgiveness_and_justice.htm">The Complexity of Forgiveness and Justice</a></b><br>The account invites reflection on how justice and forgiveness are balanced in the face of wrongdoing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_34_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 34:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_34_15_Covenant_s_role_in_bonds.htm">How does Genesis 34:15 illustrate the importance of covenant in biblical relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_34_15_Circumcision_s_cultural_role.htm">What does the demand for circumcision signify in Genesis 34:15's cultural context?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_34_15_link_to_Gen_17_covenant.htm">How does Genesis 34:15 connect to God's covenant with Abraham in Genesis 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_obedience_in_Genesis_34_15.htm">What lessons on obedience and faithfulness can we draw from Genesis 34:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_covenant_commitment_daily.htm">How can we apply the principle of covenant commitment in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_demand_circumcision_in_Gen_34_15.htm">Why did the sons of Jacob demand circumcision in Genesis 34:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_34_15_Jacob_s_sons_morality.htm">How does Genesis 34:15 reflect on the morality of Jacob's sons?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_34_15_Circumcision_s_cultural_role_2.htm">What cultural significance does circumcision hold in Genesis 34:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_genesis_34.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Genesis 34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_abrahamic_covenant.htm">What is the Abrahamic Covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_objectivism.htm">What defines a covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_circumcision_in_gen_34_22_anachronistic.htm">Genesis 34:22 -

Their words suggest openness, yet the narrative quickly reveals their intent is deceitful (<a href="/genesis/34-13.htm">Genesis 34:13</a>). Scripture often records situations where an apparent &#8220;yes&#8221; conceals another motive, such as Saul&#8217;s offer of his daughter to David while plotting harm (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17, 25</a>). The statement teaches us to weigh human promises against their later actions&#8212;remembering &#8220;the heart is deceitful above all things&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on one condition</b><p>A single stipulation governs the entire agreement. Throughout Scripture, conditional covenants are common and serious: God conditions blessing on obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>) and Joshua asks Israel to choose whom they will serve (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>). Here, Jacob&#8217;s sons set a condition that seems spiritual but is actually strategic. It reminds us that conditions can be wielded righteously&#8212;as when Paul requires repentance of the Corinthian offender (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6-8</a>)&#8212;or unrighteously, as we see in <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you become circumcised like us</b><p>Circumcision was given to Abraham as the physical sign of God&#8217;s covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>). It marked identity, separation, and submission to the Lord&#8217;s promises. By demanding it of Shechem&#8217;s people, the brothers invoke something sacred, turning a holy ordinance into a tool of vengeance. Elsewhere Scripture warns against empty ritual divorced from true devotion: &#8220;Circumcision is of value if you observe the law&#8221; (<a href="/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25-29</a>). The contrast is striking&#8212;what God intended as a symbol of faith, they deploy for violence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8212;every one of your males</b><p>Total compliance is required; no exceptions. Abraham circumcised &#8220;all the men of his household&#8221; the very day God commanded (<a href="/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23-27</a>). Later, Joshua circumcised the entire new generation before entering Canaan (<a href="/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2-9</a>), underscoring collective identity. Here, the demand for every male aims to render Shechem&#8217;s men vulnerable (<a href="/genesis/34-24.htm">Genesis 34:24-25</a>). It exposes how a command that once unified God&#8217;s people can be misused when divorced from godly motives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15</a> shows Jacob&#8217;s sons leveraging a covenant sign for personal revenge. Their conditional offer masquerades as piety but conceals violent intent. The verse warns that sacred practices lose their integrity when wielded for deceit, and it calls believers to let outward symbols reflect genuine faith and righteous motives (<a href="/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9-11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/34-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">We will consent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1461;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_225.htm">Strong's 225: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, to assent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">on one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">condition,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1434;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that you become</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(tih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">circumcised</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;him&#183;m&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Nifal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4135.htm">Strong's 4135: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut short, curtail, to blunt, to destroy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like us&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3644.htm">Strong's 3644: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like, as, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">every one of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your males.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2145.htm">Strong's 2145: </a> </span><span class="str2">Remembered, a male</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/34-15.htm">Genesis 34:15 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/34-15.htm">OT Law: Genesis 34:15 Only on this condition will we consent (Gen.
