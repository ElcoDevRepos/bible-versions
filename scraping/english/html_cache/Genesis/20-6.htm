This divine intervention highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to communicate His will directly. Abimelech, the king of Gerar, receives this message, indicating God's concern for moral integrity even among those outside the covenant community. This event parallels other biblical instances where God uses dreams to guide or warn individuals, such as Joseph's dreams in <a href="/genesis/37.htm">Genesis 37</a> and Pharaoh's dreams in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>.<p><b>Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience</b><br>God acknowledges Abimelech's innocence in taking Sarah, believing her to be Abraham's sister. This phrase underscores the importance of intention and moral integrity in God's judgment. It reflects the biblical principle that God examines the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) and values a clear conscience (<a href="/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>). Abimelech's clear conscience is crucial in understanding why God intervenes to prevent sin.<p><b>and so I have kept you from sinning against Me</b><br>God's intervention to prevent Abimelech from sinning demonstrates His protective nature over His covenant promises and His people. The phrase "sinning against Me" indicates that any wrongdoing against Sarah would ultimately be an offense against God Himself. This reflects the biblical theme that sin is primarily against God, as seen in David's confession in <a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>. God's active role in preventing sin highlights His grace and the seriousness with which He guards His covenant.<p><b>That is why I did not let you touch her</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's providential care and protection over Sarah, ensuring the purity of the lineage through which the promised Messiah would come. The protection of Sarah is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). This act of divine intervention prefigures the protection and preservation of the messianic line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. It also underscores the sanctity of marriage and God's involvement in upholding its integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>- A patriarch of the faith, Abraham is central to this account.
