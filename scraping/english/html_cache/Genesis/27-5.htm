Her attentiveness sets the stage for the unfolding events. In the cultural context of the time, women often played crucial roles within the family, and Rebekah's actions demonstrate her influence. This moment also highlights the family dynamics and favoritism present, as Rebekah favored Jacob while Isaac favored Esau. The act of listening can be seen as a catalyst for the fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where God told her that the older would serve the younger. This moment foreshadows the deception that will follow, aligning with the theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises despite human actions.<p><b>So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back,</b><br>Esau's departure to hunt game is a reflection of his character and lifestyle. Known as a skillful hunter, Esau's actions are consistent with his identity and the blessing Isaac intended to give him, which was associated with the abundance of the earth and the dew of heaven (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>). The field represents a place of labor and provision, but also a setting where Esau is vulnerable to losing his blessing. This moment connects to the earlier narrative in <a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>, where Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a meal, emphasizing his impulsive nature and lack of foresight. The act of hunting also ties into the broader biblical theme of provision and reliance on God, contrasting with Jacob's reliance on cunning and strategy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.

Had her faith been pure and exalted, she would have known that God would fulfil His word without her help; but all alike act from unworthy motives, and all have their meed of punishment.
