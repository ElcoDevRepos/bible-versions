Their compliance marks a significant change from their earlier actions when they sold Joseph into slavery. This obedience can be seen as a step towards reconciliation and restoration within the family. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience to God's will, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>, where blessings are promised for obedience.<p><b>Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed,</b><br>The mention of wagons is significant as it indicates the wealth and resources of Egypt, which was one of the most powerful nations at the time. Wagons were not commonly used in Canaan, suggesting the luxury and generosity of Pharaoh's provision. This act of giving aligns with Joseph's role as a type of Christ, who provides abundantly for His people. The wagons symbolize the means by which God facilitates the fulfillment of His promises, similar to how God provided for the Israelites during their exodus from Egypt.<p><b>and he also gave them provisions for their journey.</b><br>Joseph's provision for his brothers' journey underscores his forgiveness and care for them, despite their past betrayal. This act of kindness is reminiscent of God's provision for the Israelites in the wilderness, as seen in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a> with the manna from heaven. It also foreshadows the spiritual sustenance that Christ provides for believers, as mentioned in <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>, where Jesus declares Himself the bread of life.

Their earlier rebellion against Joseph&#8217;s dreams is gone; now they yield to the brother they once rejected, echoing the pattern of <a href="/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18&#8211;20</a> where the prodigal son returns in humility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had instructed</b><p>&#8226; Wagons were premium Egyptian transport, seldom granted to foreigners. By passing on Pharaoh&#8217;s generous order (<a href="/genesis/45-19.htm">Genesis 45:19</a>), Joseph honors authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) while blessing his family.<p>&#8226; The gift publicly vindicates Joseph. Years earlier, his brothers stripped him of a coat (<a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23</a>); now he clothes them with honor, foreshadowing how God &#8220;prepares a table in the presence of my enemies&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The wagons also serve as visible proof to Jacob that Joseph is alive and exalted (<a href="/genesis/45-27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>), much like the empty tomb authenticated Christ&#8217;s resurrection (<a href="/john/20-6.htm">John 20:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he also gave them provisions for their journey</b><p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s practical care&#8212;food, clothes, and money (<a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22&#8211;23</a>)&#8212;shows that love is expressed in tangible deeds (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; These provisions recall earlier episodes when Joseph filled their sacks secretly (<a href="/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>), portraying unearned grace.

The family must move toward the promised preservation in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/45-11.htm">Genesis 45:11</a>), just as believers press on toward the heavenly city, trusting daily bread along the way (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/45-21.htm">Genesis 45:21</a> captures a beautiful chain of obedience and grace.
