The Philistines, represented by Abimelech, seek assurance from Isaac that he will not retaliate against them. This reflects the fear and respect they have for Isaac's growing power and wealth, which they attribute to divine favor. The request for non-harm is a recognition of Isaac's potential for influence and strength, similar to the covenants made with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22-24</a>).<p><b>just as we have not harmed you</b><br>The Philistines claim they have not harmed Isaac, which is a diplomatic way of smoothing over past tensions, such as the earlier disputes over wells (<a href="/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15-22</a>). This statement may not fully align with previous actions, but it serves to establish a basis for peace. It highlights the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness, themes prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>but have done only good to you</b><br>This assertion of goodwill is part of the negotiation strategy, emphasizing the positive aspects of their interactions. While the Philistines had previously filled Isaac's wells with dirt, they now focus on the peaceful resolution of conflicts. This reflects a broader biblical principle of seeking peace and pursuing it (<a href="/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>).<p><b>sending you on your way in peace</b><br>The act of sending someone away in peace was a formal gesture of goodwill and reconciliation. It signifies the end of hostilities and the beginning of a peaceful relationship. This mirrors the biblical theme of peace as a fruit of righteousness and a gift from God (<a href="/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>, <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>And now you are blessed by the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The acknowledgment of Isaac's blessing by the LORD underscores the recognition of God's hand in his prosperity. This blessing is a continuation of the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate blessing through Jesus Christ, a descendant of Isaac, who brings salvation to all nations (<a href="/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>). The Philistines' recognition of this blessing highlights the theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the central figure in this chapter.

Each phrase highlights key truths: God&#8217;s people should give and receive assurances against harm, maintain blameless conduct, practice active goodness, foster peaceful departures, and live so evidently under divine blessing that even outsiders acknowledge it. The passage invites believers to trust the Lord&#8217;s protection, keep relationships honorable, and let visible blessing point others to the One who bestows it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thou wilt do us no hurt</span>, - literally, <span class="accented">if thou wilt do us evil</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. thy curse come upon thee!); the force being to negative in the strongest way possible any intention of injury (cf. <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">as we have not touched thee,</span> - i.e. injured thee; which was not true, as they, through their servants, had robbed Isaac of at least two wells - <span class="cmt_word">and as we have done unto thee nothing but good</span>, - Abimelech's estimate of his own behavior, if exceedingly favorable to himself, is at least natural (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and have sent thee away in peace</span> (without open violence certainly, because of Isaac's yielding, but scarcely without hostility): <span class="cmt_word">thou art now the blessed of the Lord</span>.
