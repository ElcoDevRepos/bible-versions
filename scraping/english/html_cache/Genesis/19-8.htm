Lot's offer of his daughters reflects the extreme measures he was willing to take to protect his guests, emphasizing the sacred duty of hospitality in the ancient Near East. This act also underscores the depravity of Sodom, as Lot felt compelled to offer his daughters to prevent a greater sin against his guests.<p><b>Let me bring them to you, and you can do to them as you please.</b><br>Lot's willingness to sacrifice his daughters is shocking and illustrates the moral decline of Sodom, as well as the complex ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in a fallen world. This phrase can be compared to the story of the Levite and his concubine in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>, where similar themes of hospitality, protection, and moral corruption are present. It also raises questions about the value of women in ancient societies and the lengths to which one might go to uphold social customs.<p><b>But do not do anything to these men,</b><br>Lot's plea underscores the importance of protecting guests, who were considered sacred under one's roof. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of hospitality, where the host was responsible for the safety and well-being of their guests. The protection of guests is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in the story of Abraham entertaining angels in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>.<p><b>for they have come under the protection of my roof.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase highlights the inviolable nature of hospitality in the ancient world. Once someone entered a home, they were under the host's protection, a concept deeply ingrained in the culture of the time. This protection is seen as a moral obligation, and Lot's insistence on safeguarding his guests, even at great personal cost, reflects the seriousness with which this duty was regarded. This concept of protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers refuge and safety to those who come to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, residing in Sodom.

Scripture faithfully reports Lot&#8217;s words without endorsing them, thereby warning every reader to guard the heart, resist societal pressure, and uphold God&#8217;s uncompromising standard of righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">I have two daughters.</span>--It is plain from <a href="/judges/19-24.htm" title="Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man do not so vile a thing.">Judges 19:24</a> that this proposal was not viewed in old time with the horror which it seems to deserve. Granting with St. Ambrose that it was the substitution of a smaller for a greater sin, and with St. Chrysostom that Lot was bound by the laws of hospitality to do his utmost to protect his guests, yet he was also bound as a father equally to protect his daughters to the last extremity: and if men might substitute smaller for greater sins, they would have an excuse for practising every form of wickedness. The difficulty arises from the high character given of Lot by St. Peter (<a href="/context/2_peter/2-7.htm" title="And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:">2Peter 2:7-8</a>): but Lot was righteous only relatively; and though his soul was daily vexed by what he saw, it was not vexed enough to make him quit such evil surroundings, and return to the healthy and virtuous life of the mountains. And, when finally he sought refuge in them, as it was not of his own free will, but on compulsion (<a href="/genesis/19-30.htm" title="And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelled in a cave, he and his two daughters.">Genesis 19:30</a>), he found there no peace, but shared, even if unknowingly, in deeds of horrible lust. The warning of his fall is, that men who part with religious privileges for the sake of worldly advantage are in danger of sinking into moral degradation, and of losing, with their faith and hope, not only their self-respect and happiness, but even that earthly profit for the sake of which they sacrificed their religion.<p><span class= "bld">Unto these men.</span>--The form of the pronoun is archaic, and occurs again in <a href="/genesis/19-25.htm" title="And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.">Genesis 19:25</a>.
