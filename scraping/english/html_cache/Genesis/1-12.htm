The production of vegetation signifies the beginning of life on earth, setting the stage for the sustenance of all living creatures. In biblical context, this act of creation emphasizes God's sovereignty over nature and His provision for His creation. The earth's ability to produce vegetation without human intervention underscores the divine order established by God.<p><b>Seed-bearing plants according to their kinds:</b><br>The mention of "seed-bearing plants" indicates the introduction of a reproductive system within creation, ensuring the perpetuation of plant life. The phrase "according to their kinds" suggests a divine order and categorization within creation, reflecting the intentionality and precision of God's work. This concept of "kinds" is foundational in understanding the biblical view of creation, where each species is distinct and reproduces within its own category, aligning with the natural laws established by God.<p><b>And trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds:</b><br>Trees bearing fruit with seed further illustrate the provision and abundance within God's creation. The fruit serves as nourishment for both humans and animals, while the seeds ensure the continuation of plant life. The repetition of "according to their kinds" reinforces the idea of order and distinction within creation. This phrase also foreshadows the importance of trees and fruit in biblical narratives, such as the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in <a href="/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>.<p><b>And God saw that it was good:</b><br>This declaration of goodness reflects God's satisfaction with His creation. It signifies the completion and perfection of this stage of creation, affirming that everything God made was in harmony with His divine purpose. The repeated affirmation of goodness throughout the creation account underscores the inherent value and beauty of the created world. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's goodness and the ultimate restoration of creation, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-5</a>, where God makes all things new.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who commands the earth to bring forth vegetation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The place where vegetation is produced, responding to God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vegetation.htm">Vegetation</a></b><br>Includes seed-bearing plants and fruit-bearing trees, each according to its kind.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The event of God bringing forth life on earth, specifically plant life on the third day of creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>God commands, and creation responds.

In all probability the seed forms were in the soil from the first, only waiting to be vitalized by the <span class="accented">Ruach Elohim - The</span> Spirit of God; or they may have been then created. Certainly they were not evolved from the dead matter of the dry land. Scripture, no more than science, is acquainted with Abiogenesis. Believing that "if it were given to her to- look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time, she might "witness the evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter," science yet honestly affirms "that she sees no reason for believing that the feat (of vitalizing dead matter) has been performed yet" (Huxley's 'Brit.

The time when the earth put forth its verdure, viz., towards the close of the third day, after light, air, earth, and water had been prepared and so adjusted as to minister to the life of plants, was a signal proof of the wisdom of the Creator and of the naturalness of his working. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
