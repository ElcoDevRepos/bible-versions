In the ancient Near Eastern context, garments often symbolized authority and identity. Joseph's cloak, a significant piece of clothing, represents his position and trust within Potiphar's household. The act of grabbing the cloak signifies an attempt to seize control and assert dominance over Joseph. This incident echoes the earlier event in <a href="/genesis/37-23.htm">Genesis 37:23</a>, where Joseph's brothers stripped him of his robe, symbolizing betrayal and loss of status.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Sleep with me!&#8221;</b><br>The directness of Potiphar's wife's demand reflects the moral and ethical challenges Joseph faced in a foreign land. In Egyptian society, sexual immorality was not uncommon, and Joseph's refusal to comply with her request demonstrates his commitment to God's standards and his loyalty to Potiphar. This temptation parallels the broader biblical theme of resisting sin, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, which warns against the seduction of an adulterous woman. Joseph's response serves as a model of integrity and faithfulness.<p><b>But leaving his cloak in her hand</b><br>Joseph's decision to leave his cloak behind underscores his determination to flee from sin, even at the cost of his personal belongings and reputation. This act of leaving the cloak can be seen as a metaphor for shedding anything that hinders one's spiritual walk. <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a> encourages believers to "lay aside every weight" that entangles them. Joseph's choice to prioritize righteousness over material possessions foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of seeking God's kingdom above all else (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><b>he escaped and ran outside</b><br>Joseph's escape is a physical manifestation of the biblical principle to flee from temptation, as advised in <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>. His immediate action highlights the urgency and seriousness with which one should respond to sin. This moment of flight is reminiscent of the deliverance themes throughout Scripture, where God provides a way of escape for His people, such as the Israelites' exodus from Egypt. Joseph's actions prefigure the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who empowers believers to overcome sin and temptation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man, sold into slavery by his brothers, who becomes a servant in Potiphar's house in Egypt.

Potiphar&#8217;s wife is no longer merely speaking; she seizes Joseph, showing how temptation can move from suggestion to assault (cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-13.htm">Proverbs 7:13&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s cloak becomes a symbol of his integrity under attack. Earlier a cloak marked him as favored (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>); now another cloak is used in an attempt to compromise him.<p>&#8226; Scripture portrays the believer&#8217;s body as a temple to be guarded (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19&#8211;20</a>); Joseph&#8217;s immediate danger reminds us that holiness often requires vigilance in everyday settings, not just overtly &#8220;religious&#8221; moments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said, &#8220;Sleep with me!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The temptation is clear, direct, and repeated (<a href="/genesis/39-7.htm">Genesis 39:7</a>,10). No ambiguity exists about what is being asked.<p>&#8226; Joseph has already rehearsed his refusal (39:8-9), which equips him to stand firm when the pressure intensifies&#8212;paralleling Jesus&#8217; use of rehearsed Scripture in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin always promises pleasure while ignoring its price (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). Joseph&#8217;s earlier statement&#8212;&#8220;How could I do this great evil and sin against God?&#8221;&#8212;keeps God at the center, anchoring his moral compass (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But leaving his cloak in her hand</b><p>&#8226; Joseph chooses to lose a garment rather than lose his purity. Better to surrender a possession than surrender obedience (<a href="/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The cloak in her hand becomes evidence she will later twist into false accusation, yet Joseph accepts that risk. Faithfulness sometimes invites misunderstanding and injustice (<a href="/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; His decision illustrates the call to separate from compromising situations, even when consequences loom (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he escaped and ran outside</b><p>&#8226; Fleeing is not cowardice; Scripture commands it: &#8220;Flee sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>) and &#8220;Flee youthful passions&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s faithfulness provides &#8220;a way of escape&#8221; with every temptation (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). Joseph literally takes that way.<p>&#8226; Running outside puts distance between him and sin, echoing <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>: &#8220;Avoid it&#8230;turn away from it and pass on.&#8221; Practical steps&#8212;physical removal, accountability, transparent living&#8212;remain timeless strategies.<p>&#8226; His swift exit prefigures the believer&#8217;s spiritual armor: &#8220;having done everything, to stand firm&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>), sometimes by strategically retreating.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-12.htm">Genesis 39:12</a> shows temptation turning aggressive, Joseph&#8217;s unwavering resolve, and the God-provided escape he seizes. He sacrifices a cloak to preserve a clear conscience, demonstrating that holiness may cost something tangible but yields enduring honor. The verse invites every believer to predetermine obedience, recognize the moment to flee, and trust God to vindicate faithfulness even when the world misreads our motives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She grabbed [Joseph]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1461;&#1447;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7791;&#183;p&#601;&#183;&#347;&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
