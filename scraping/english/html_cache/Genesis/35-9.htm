Paddan-aram, located in the region of Mesopotamia, was where Jacob fled to escape his brother Esau's wrath and where he married Leah and Rachel. This return signifies a fulfillment of God's promise to bring Jacob back to the land of his fathers (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). It also represents a transition from a period of exile and servitude under Laban to a time of establishing his own household in the Promised Land.<p><b>God appeared to him again</b><br>This appearance of God to Jacob is a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to a human. It is significant because it reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Jacob. The use of "again" indicates that this is not the first encounter Jacob has had with God; previous encounters include the dream at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12-15</a>) and the wrestling with God at Peniel (<a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>). These divine encounters underscore God's ongoing guidance and presence in Jacob's life.<p><b>and blessed him</b><br>The blessing from God is a reaffirmation of the Abrahamic covenant, which includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing to all nations through his lineage (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This blessing is not just a personal favor but a continuation of God's redemptive plan through Jacob's family line, which ultimately leads to the coming of Jesus Christ, a descendant of Jacob. The blessing also serves as a divine endorsement of Jacob's role as the patriarch of the Israelite nation, reinforcing his new identity as Israel, which means "he struggles with God" (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandson of Abraham.

At Beth-el Jacob, when going forth, had seen the dream which assured him of Divine protection; at Beth-el, on his return, God renews the covenant, confirms to him the name of Israel, and transfers to him the promises of a numerous seed and of the possession of the land.
