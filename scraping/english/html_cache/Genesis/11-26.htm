This age marks a period in the post-Flood world where lifespans were gradually decreasing. Terah's age also sets the stage for the narrative of Abram, who would later be called Abraham, a central figure in biblical history.<p><b>he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran</b><br>Abram, later known as Abraham, is a pivotal figure in the Bible, often called the "father of faith." His story begins here, and he is a key ancestor of the Israelites, as well as a spiritual forefather to Christians and Muslims. Nahor and Haran are less prominent but still important; Nahor's descendants include Rebekah, who becomes Isaac's wife, and Haran is the father of Lot, who plays a significant role in the narrative of Sodom and Gomorrah. The mention of these three sons together suggests a family unit that would have been typical in ancient Mesopotamian culture, where family lineage and inheritance were crucial. This phrase also sets the stage for the call of Abram by God, which is a foundational moment in the biblical narrative, leading to the establishment of the covenant with Abraham and the eventual formation of the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/terah.htm">Terah</a></b><br>The father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

First named on account of his spiritual pre-eminence. If Abram was Terah's eldest son, then, as Abram was seventy-five years of age when Terah died (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>), Terah's whole life could only have been 145 years. But Terah lived to the age of 205 years (<a href="/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>); therefore Abram was born in Terah's 130th year. This, however, makes it surprising that Abraham should have reckoned it impossible for him to have a son at 100 years (<a href="/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>); only, after having lived so long in childless wedlock, it was not strange that he should feel somewhat doubtful of any issue by Sarai. Kalisch believes that Stephen (<a href="/acts/7-4.htm">Acts 7:4</a>) made a mistake in saying Terah died before his son's migration from Charran, and that he really survived that event by sixty years; while the Samaritan text escapes the difficulty by shortening the life of Terah to 145 years. <span class="cmt_word">And Nahor</span>, who must have been younger than Haran, since he married Haran's daughter. <span class="cmt_word">And Haran</span>, who, as the eldest, must have been born in Terah's seventieth year. Thus the second family register, like the flint, concludes after ten generations with the birth of three sons, who, like Noah's, are mentioned not in the order of their ages, but of their spiritual pre-eminence. <p> From this table it appears that 292 years, according to the Hebrew text, passed away between the Flood and the birth, or 292 +75 = = 367 between the Flood and the call of Abraham. Reckoning, however, the age of Torah at Abram's birth as 130 (<span class="accented">vide</span> Exposition), the full period between the Deluge and the patriarch's departure from Haran will be 367 + 60 = = 427 years, which, allowing five pairs to each family, Murphy computes, would in the course of ten generations yield a population of 15,625,000 souls; or, supposing a rate of increase equal to that of Abraham's posterity in Egypt during the 400 years that elapsed from the call to the exodus, the inhabitants of the world in the time of Abraham would be between seven and eight millions. It must, however, be remembered that an element of uncertainty enters into all computations based upon even the Hebrew text. The age of Terah at the birth (apparently) of Abram is put down at seventy. But it admits of demonstration that Abram was born in the 130th year of Terah. What guarantee then do we possess that in every instance the registered son was the firstborn? In the case of Arphaxad this is almost implied in the statement that he was born two years after the Flood. But if the case of Eber were parallel with that of Terah, and Joktan were the son that he begat in his thirty-fourth year, then obviously the birth of Peleg, like that of Abram, may have happened sixty years later; in which case it is apparent that any reckoning which proceeded on the minute verbal accuracy of the registered numbers would be entirely at fault. This consideration might have gone far to explain the wide divergence between the numbers of the Samaritan and Septuagint as compared with the Hebrew text, had it not been that they both agree with it in setting down seventy as the age of Terah at the date of Abram's birth. The palpable artificiality also of these later tables renders them even less worthy of credit than the Hebrew. The introduction by the LXX. of Cainan as the son of Arphaxad, though seemingly confirmed by Luke (<a href="/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35, 36</a>), is clearly an interpolation. It does not occur in the LXX. version of <a href="/1_chronicles/1-24.htm">1 Chronicles 1:24</a>, and is not found in either the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Targums or the ancient versions, in Josephus or Philo, or in the Codex Beza of the Gospel of Luke. Its appearance in Luke (and probably also in the LXX.) can only be explained as an interpolation. Wordsworth is inclined to regard it as authentic in Luke, and to suppose that Cainaan was excluded from the Mosaic table either to render it symmetrical, as Luke's table is rendered symmetrical by its insertion, or because of some moral offence, which, though necessitating his expulsion from a Hebrew register, would not prevent his reappearance in his proper place under the gospel. <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Terah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;e&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8646.htm">Strong's 8646: </a> </span><span class="str2">Terah -- Abraham's father, also a place in the desert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">To live, to revive</span><br /><br /><span class="word">70</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7657.htm">Strong's 7657: </a> </span><span class="str2">Seventy (a cardinal number)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years old,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8141.htm">Strong's 8141: </a> </span><span class="str2">A year</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he became the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1433;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;le&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Abram,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_87.htm">Strong's 87: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abram -- 'exalted father', the original name of Abraham</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nahor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5152.htm">Strong's 5152: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nochor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Haran.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2039.htm">Strong's 2039: </a> </span><span class="str2">Haran -- 'mountaineer', a brother of Abram, also an Israelite</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/11-26.htm">OT Law: Genesis 11:26 Terah lived seventy years and became (Gen.
