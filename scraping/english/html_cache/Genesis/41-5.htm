In the ancient Near East, dreams were often considered a medium for divine communication. The repetition of dreams in Joseph's story (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) and here with Pharaoh suggests the certainty and importance of the message. The act of falling back asleep and dreaming again underscores God's sovereignty in ensuring Pharaoh receives the full revelation needed for the future of Egypt and the surrounding nations.<p><b>Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe,</b><br>The number seven in biblical literature often symbolizes completeness or perfection, seen in the creation week (Genesis 1) and numerous other instances throughout Scripture. The heads of grain being "plump and ripe" suggest abundance and prosperity, which is later interpreted by Joseph as seven years of plenty (<a href="/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26</a>). This imagery would resonate with an agrarian society like Egypt, where grain was a staple and a symbol of wealth and sustenance. The plumpness of the grain contrasts with the subsequent dream of thin and scorched heads, highlighting the impending famine.<p><b>came up on one stalk:</b><br>The image of multiple heads of grain on a single stalk signifies an extraordinary yield, further emphasizing the abundance to come. In the context of Egyptian agriculture, such a phenomenon would be seen as a divine blessing, as it defies natural expectations. This detail foreshadows the miraculous provision and the need for wise stewardship during the years of plenty. The singular stalk can also be seen as a type of unity and strength, which is later mirrored in Joseph's leadership and the unification of resources to save many lives during the famine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who experiences the dreams that Joseph later interprets.

The statement of Herodotus (ii. 36), that the Egyptians regarded it as disgraceful to feed upon wheat or barley, is disproved by the paintings in the temples, especially in the district of Thebes, which show that it was the main crop there, and its cultivation held in high honour.

The assertion of Herodotus, that the Egyptians counted it a disgrace to live on wheat and barley (2:36), Wilkinson regards as incorrect, since "both wheat and barley are noticed in Lower Egypt long before Herodotus' time (<a href="/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 32</a>), and the paintings of the Thebaid prove that they were grown extensively in that part of the country; they were among the offerings in the temples; and the king, at his coronation, cutting some ears of wheat, afterwards offered to the gods as the staple production of Egypt, shows how great a value was set on a grain which Herodotus would lead us to suppose was held in abhorrence" (Rawlinson's 'Hexodotus,' vol. 2. p. 49). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but he fell back asleep</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1429;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
