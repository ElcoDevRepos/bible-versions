This lineage is significant as it leads to Noah and eventually to Jesus Christ. The birth of Seth's son marks a new generation and a continuation of hope and faithfulness to God. The genealogical records in Genesis emphasize the importance of lineage and heritage in biblical history.<p><b>and he called him Enosh</b><br>The name Enosh means "man" or "mortal," highlighting the human condition and the frailty of life. This naming reflects an awareness of human mortality and dependence on God. Enosh's birth signifies a new beginning and a renewed focus on spiritual matters, as his generation is noted for initiating a public worship of God.<p><b>At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD</b><br>This phrase indicates a significant development in the spiritual life of humanity. "Calling upon the name of the LORD" suggests a formal and communal act of worship, prayer, and reliance on God. It marks the beginning of organized worship and a collective acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. This act of calling upon the LORD is seen throughout Scripture as a sign of faith and devotion, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on calling upon the name of Jesus for salvation, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>. This moment in Genesis represents a turning point where humanity begins to seek a deeper relationship with God amidst a world increasingly marked by sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/seth.htm">Seth</a></b><br>The third son of Adam and Eve, born after the death of Abel.

Up to this time there had been two names for <span class= "ital">man: </span>Adam, which also in Assyrian--another Semitic dialect--has the same meaning, as Sir H. Rawlinson has shown: and Ish, a <span class= "ital">being. </span>(See on <a href="/genesis/2-23.htm" title="And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.">Genesis 2:23</a>.) We have now Enosh, which, according to Frst and others, signifies <span class= "ital">mortal; </span>but of this there is no proof. Most probably it is the generic word for man. and is used as such in the Aramaic dialects. Thus in Syriac and Chaldee our Lord is styled <span class= "ital">bar-enosh, </span>the son of man: not the son of a mortal, but the son of man absolutely.<p><span class= "bld">Then began men (Heb., <span class= "ital">then it was begun</span>) to call upon the name of the Lord (Jehovah).</span>--That is, the notion of Divinity began now to be attached to this name, and even in their worship men called upon God as Jehovah. Eve, as we have seen, attached no such idea to it; and when, in <a href="/genesis/4-3.htm" title="And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD.">Genesis 4:3</a>, we read that Cain and Abel brought an offering to Jehovah, these are the words of the narrator, who in the story of the fall had expressly styled the Deity Jehovah-Elohim, that is, Jehovah-God, or more exactly, "the coming God," in order to show that Elohim and Jehovah are one. Two hundred and thirty-five years had elapsed between the birth of Cain and that of Enos, and men had learned a truer appreciation of the promise given to their primal mother, in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>, than she herself had when she supposed that her first child was to win back for her the Paradise. Probably they had no exact doctrinal views about His person and nature; it was the office of prophecy "by divers portions" to give these (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>). But they had been taught that "He who should be" was Divine, and to be worshipped. It is the hopeless error of commentators to suppose that Eve, and Enos, and others, knew all that is now known, and all that the inspired narrator knew. They thus do violence to the plainest language of Holy Scripture, and involve its interpretation in utter confusion. Read without these preconceived notions, the sense is plain: that the name Jehovah had now become a title of the Deity, whereas previously no such sacredness had been attached to it. It was long afterwards, in the days of Moses, that it became the personal name of the covenant God of the Jews.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And to Seth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1444;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
