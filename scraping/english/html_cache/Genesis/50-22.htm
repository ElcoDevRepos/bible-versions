This phrase highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>). The presence of Joseph's family in Egypt sets the stage for the eventual enslavement and subsequent Exodus, a pivotal event in Israelite history. Theologically, this period in Egypt is seen as a time of preservation and growth for the nascent nation of Israel.<p><b>and Joseph lived to the age of 110</b><br>Joseph's lifespan of 110 years is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where 110 was considered an ideal age, symbolizing a full and blessed life. This reflects the favor and blessing Joseph received from God throughout his life, despite the trials he faced. His long life allowed him to see the fulfillment of God's promises to his family and to ensure the continuation of the covenant through his descendants. Joseph's life can be seen as a type of Christ, as he was a savior to his people, providing for them in times of need, much like Christ provides salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A key figure in the Book of Genesis, Joseph is the son of Jacob and Rachel.
