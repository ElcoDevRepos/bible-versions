The delay was due to their father Jacob's reluctance to send Benjamin to Egypt, which was necessary to secure more grain and prove their honesty to Joseph, whom they did not recognize. This highlights the tension between obedience to parental authority and the necessity of action in dire circumstances. The delay also serves as a narrative device to heighten the drama and anticipation of the brothers' second journey to Egypt.<p><b>we could have come and gone</b><br>The phrase suggests the efficiency and speed with which the brothers could have completed their mission had they acted sooner. It underscores the practical nature of their journey, which involved traveling from Canaan to Egypt, a significant distance that would have taken considerable time and effort. This journey is emblematic of the broader theme of pilgrimage and movement in the biblical narrative, reflecting the transient nature of life and the pursuit of sustenance and survival.<p><b>twice by now.&#8221;</b><br>This emphasizes the extent of the delay and the missed opportunities due to hesitation. The mention of "twice" indicates that sufficient time had passed for two round trips, highlighting the urgency of their need for food during the famine. This also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and fulfillment of God's plan for the family of Jacob, as the delay ultimately leads to a deeper understanding and resolution of past grievances. The concept of "twice" can also be seen as a reflection of the dual nature of God's provision and timing, which often surpasses human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of Jacob's sons, who takes a leadership role in persuading his father to send Benjamin to Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, who is hesitant to send his youngest son, Benjamin, to Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob, whose presence is required in Egypt to secure more grain.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph, Jacob's son, is a powerful official and where the brothers must go to buy grain.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe famine affecting Canaan and surrounding regions, prompting the need for grain from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timely_obedience.htm">The Importance of Timely Obedience</a></b><br>Delays in obedience can lead to missed opportunities and prolonged suffering.
