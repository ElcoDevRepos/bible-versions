Wells were vital for survival in the arid regions of the ancient Near East, symbolizing life and sustenance. The act of digging another well signifies perseverance and faith in God's provision, despite opposition. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness and the need for human persistence in the face of adversity.<p><b>and quarreled over that one also;</b><br>The recurring disputes over wells highlight the ongoing tension between Isaac and the Philistines. This reflects the historical context of territorial disputes common in the ancient world, where water rights were crucial for survival. The quarreling over wells can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual struggles, where believers must contend for the blessings and promises of God. This theme of conflict over resources is echoed in other biblical narratives, such as the disputes between Jacob and Laban.<p><b>so he named it Sitnah.</b><br>The name "Sitnah" means "opposition" or "hostility," capturing the essence of the conflict Isaac faced. Naming places based on events was a common practice in biblical times, serving as a reminder of God's intervention or human experiences. This act of naming also foreshadows the ongoing enmity between the descendants of Isaac and the surrounding nations. The concept of naming as a form of memorial is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the naming of Bethel by Jacob. The opposition Isaac faced can be seen as a type of the opposition Jesus Christ faced during His earthly ministry, where He too encountered hostility but continued His mission with perseverance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the central figure in this passage.

signals a continuation of obedience in motion.<p>&#8226; The word links back to Isaac reopening his father&#8217;s wells (<a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>) and digging at Esek (<a href="/genesis/26-20.htm">Genesis 26:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Even after conflict, Isaac&#8217;s next step is still action, not retreat&#8212;mirroring <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>&#8217;s call to live peaceably &#8220;if possible.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; underscores a life paced by trust; every subsequent move comes after God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a> that He is &#8220;with&#8221; Isaac.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They dug another well</b><p>Digging a well in the Negev is back-breaking and costly, yet Isaac&#8217;s servants begin again.<p>&#8226;

(<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12</a>), so Isaac acts in faith that the land will yield water again.<p>&#8226; Stewardship: Like Jacob later rolling away the stone at a well (<a href="/genesis/29-10.htm">Genesis 29:10</a>), Isaac takes practical steps toward God&#8217;s provision rather than waiting passively.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And quarreled over that one also</b><p>The Philistines&#8217;
