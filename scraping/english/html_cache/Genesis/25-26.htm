The act of Jacob grasping Esau's heel is symbolic of the conflict that would characterize their relationship. In Hebrew, the name Jacob (Ya'akov) is related to the word for "heel" (akev), indicating his role as the one who follows or supplants. This foreshadows Jacob's later actions in obtaining Esau's birthright and blessing. The imagery of grasping the heel also suggests a struggle for dominance, which is a recurring theme in their lives and the history of their descendants, the Israelites and Edomites.<p><b>so he was named Jacob.</b><br>The name Jacob means "he grasps the heel" or "he deceives," reflecting both his birth action and his later life. Names in the Bible often carry significant meaning and can reflect character or destiny. Jacob's life is marked by instances of deception, such as when he tricks Esau out of his birthright and deceives his father Isaac to receive the blessing meant for Esau. This name also points to the transformative journey Jacob undergoes, as he later wrestles with God and is renamed Israel, meaning "he struggles with God," indicating a shift in his character and relationship with God.<p><b>And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.</b><br>Isaac's age at the birth of Jacob and Esau highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants. Isaac, the child of promise, waited twenty years after marrying Rebekah to have children, emphasizing the theme of divine timing and faith in God's promises. This period of waiting also mirrors the experiences of other patriarchs, such as Abraham and Sarah, who waited for the birth of Isaac. The age of Isaac at the twins' birth underscores the continuation of the covenantal line through Jacob, despite the challenges and delays faced by the patriarchs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The second son of Isaac and Rebekah, born grasping his brother Esau's heel.
