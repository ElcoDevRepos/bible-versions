This practice is also seen with Sarah and Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>. Rachel's decision reflects her desperation and desire to compete with her sister Leah, who had already borne several children to Jacob. The giving of a servant as a wife was a legal and socially accepted practice, though it often led to familial strife, as seen in the tensions between Sarah and Hagar. This act also highlights the polygamous nature of some patriarchal families, which, while recorded in Scripture, often led to complications and was not God's original design for marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>).<p><b>and he slept with her</b><br>This phrase indicates the consummation of the relationship, which was necessary for Bilhah to conceive and bear children for Rachel. The act of sleeping with Bilhah was not merely a physical union but also a legal one, as it established Bilhah's role as a secondary wife or concubine. This action set the stage for the birth of Dan and Naphtali, two of the twelve tribes of Israel. The narrative underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises despite human manipulation and flawed decisions. It also foreshadows the complex family dynamics that would later affect the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who was initially barren and desperate to bear children.
