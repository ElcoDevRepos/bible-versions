Chariots were symbols of power and prestige in ancient Egypt, often used by royalty and high-ranking officials. The "second chariot" signifies Joseph's rank as the second most powerful man in the kingdom. This elevation is a fulfillment of the dreams Joseph had in his youth (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), where his brothers' sheaves bowed to his sheaf, symbolizing his future leadership and authority.<p><b>with men calling out before him, &#8220;Bow the knee!&#8221;</b><br>The command to "Bow the knee" reflects the respect and submission required by those who encountered Joseph. This public proclamation ensured that all recognized Joseph's authority and position. The act of bowing is a sign of reverence and submission, which is consistent with the cultural practices of the time. This scene foreshadows the ultimate submission to Christ, as <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a> states that every knee will bow to Jesus, acknowledging His lordship.<p><b>So he placed him over all the land of Egypt</b><br>Joseph's appointment over all the land of Egypt demonstrates God's providence and the fulfillment of His promises. Despite Joseph's earlier trials, including being sold into slavery and unjustly imprisoned, God's plan for him prevailed. This mirrors the biblical theme of God raising the humble and exalting those who are faithful (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>).

Joseph ride in his second chariot</b><p>&#8226; Pharaoh publicly elevates Joseph by giving him &#8220;his second chariot,&#8221; the royal vehicle that follows directly behind Pharaoh&#8217;s own. This is a tangible symbol that Joseph is now second only to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; Riding in the king&#8217;s procession shows immediate, visible authority. Similar royal pageantry appears when Mordecai is honored in <a href="/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8&#8211;11</a>, where a king&#8217;s horse and royal garb certify status.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence shines through: the same Joseph once carried to Egypt as a slave now rides in splendor. <a href="/psalms/105-17.htm">Psalm 105:17&#8211;21</a> recalls this reversal, stressing that the Lord &#8220;sent a man before them&#8212;Joseph... the king released him; the ruler of peoples set him free.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This moment illustrates <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>: &#8220;Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will stand before kings.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s God-given wisdom places him where only God could put him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with men calling out before him, &#8220;Bow the knee!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Heralds run ahead shouting an unmistakable command of homage. The phrase guarantees that every onlooker recognizes Joseph&#8217;s new rank (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Such forced recognition foreshadows a greater truth: one day every knee will bow to the Lord&#8217;s exalted Servant (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>). Joseph&#8217;s honor points forward to Christ&#8217;s supreme exaltation.<p>&#8226; The call to bow also pictures submission to God-appointed authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>). Those who bowed to Joseph were, indirectly, bowing to the wisdom of the God who placed him there.<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4-6</a> shows a pagan counterfeit of this scene, demanding worship of an idol. In sharp contrast, Joseph&#8217;s elevation is rooted in the true God&#8217;s plan, not human pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he placed him over all the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Pharaoh seals the promotion: Joseph now administers the entire nation (<a href="/genesis/41-44.htm">Genesis 41:44</a>). This entrustment echoes the dominion mandate originally given in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, now exercised through a faithful servant.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s stewardship prepares for the coming famine, preserving countless lives, including the covenant family of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> shines through&#8212;God works &#8220;all things together for good&#8221; even when the path includes betrayal and prison.<p>&#8226; Stephen&#8217;s sermon highlights this decisive placement: &#8220;God gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh... and appointed him ruler over Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-10.htm">Acts 7:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern recurs throughout Scripture&#8212;God lifts up the humble (<a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a>) and places them where His redemptive purposes advance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a> shows Pharaoh&#8217;s threefold act: positioning Joseph in the royal chariot, commanding public homage, and granting him authority over Egypt.

The scene testifies to the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty, His faithfulness to exalt the humble, and His ability to turn adversity into blessing for His people and the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/41.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">In the second chariot.</span>--The object of this procession was to display Joseph to the people as their new governor.
