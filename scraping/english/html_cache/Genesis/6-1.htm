The multiplication of humanity fulfills God's command in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> to "be fruitful and multiply." This growth sets the stage for the events leading to the flood, as the increase in population also leads to an increase in wickedness. The phrase "on the face of the earth" emphasizes the widespread nature of this growth, covering the entire inhabited world at the time.<p><b>and daughters were born to them</b><br>The mention of daughters highlights the natural process of human reproduction and the continuation of family lines. This detail is significant in the context of the following verses, where the "sons of God" take notice of these daughters. The birth of daughters is a normal part of human expansion, but it also introduces the narrative of intermingling between different groups, which some interpretations suggest led to moral and spiritual decline. This phrase sets up the context for the subsequent events involving the Nephilim and the divine judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men (Humanity)</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Adam and Eve, who began to increase in number on the earth.

God&#8217;s first mandate to humanity was, &#8220;Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). <a href="/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a> shows that this command was being fulfilled literally as generations followed Adam&#8217;s line (<a href="/bsb/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a>).<p>&#8226; Rapid population growth marks the period just before the Flood; Jesus later linked that busy, thriving society with the time immediately prior to His return (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-38</a>).<p>&#8226; The multiplication of people emphasizes both human blessing and human sin: more image-bearers on earth (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>), yet also more hearts &#8220;only evil continually&#8221;

&#8220;Face of the earth&#8221; also reminds us that God sees everything done under heaven (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>) and holds all accountable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and daughters were born to them</b><p>&#8226;

here the focus on daughters points to intermarriage that would compromise godly lines (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>).<p>&#8226;

There may have been other substitutions besides that of Seth for Cain; and Noah, born when his father was 182 years of age, seems a case in point. He was selected to be the restorer of mankind because of his piety, and may have had many brothers and sisters older than himself. Each patriarch, however, begat "sons and daughters," and as we find Cain building a city, he must have seen, at all events, the possibility of a considerable population settling round him. It was probably, as we saw above, about the time of Enoch that the corruption of the family of Adam began to become general.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">it was</span>; not in immediate sequence to the preceding chapter, but at some earlier point in the antediluvian period; perhaps about the time of Enoch (corresponding to that of Lamech the Cainite), if not in the days of Enos.
