Jacob's favoritism echoes the preferential treatment he received from his mother Rebekah over his brother Esau. This favoritism sets the stage for familial discord, as seen in the jealousy and hatred it incites among Joseph's brothers. The theme of favoritism and its consequences is a significant motif in Genesis, illustrating the complexities of family dynamics and the unfolding of God's plan through flawed human relationships.<p><b>because Joseph had been born to him in his old age</b><br>Joseph was the firstborn of Rachel, Jacob's favored wife, which added to his special status. The mention of Jacob's old age emphasizes the long-awaited fulfillment of his desire for a son from Rachel, further intensifying his affection for Joseph. This detail also underscores the miraculous nature of Joseph's birth, as it occurred when Jacob was advanced in years, reminiscent of other biblical figures like Isaac, who was born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age.<p><b>so he made him a robe of many colors</b><br>The robe, often translated as a "coat of many colors" or a "richly ornamented robe," symbolizes Joseph's favored status and possibly a position of authority within the family. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such garments were typically worn by nobility or those in positions of honor. The robe becomes a focal point of the brothers' jealousy and a catalyst for the events that follow, including Joseph's eventual sale into slavery. This garment can also be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus' own rejection by His brethren and His ultimate exaltation. The robe's significance is further highlighted in its connection to the broader narrative of Joseph's life, which parallels the story of redemption and divine providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, formerly known as Jacob.

What begins as a father&#8217;s special affection sets in motion events that God will turn to blessing, proving again that He works all things together for His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/37.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">He was the son of his old age.</span>--Jacob was ninety-one when Joseph was born; but at Benjamin's birth he was eight or nine years older; and according to the common belief that Jacob was only twenty years in Padan-aram, the four sons of the handmaids must have been about Joseph's age, and Leah's last two sons even younger. But the epithet is intelligible if Jacob had waited twenty-seven years after his marriage with Rachel, before Joseph was born. There would then be a considerable interval between him and the other sons; and though Rachel had a second son some years afterwards, yet Joseph would continue to be the son long looked for, whose birth had given him so great happiness; whereas his joy at Benjamin's coming was bought at the terrible price of the mother's death.<p><span class= "bld">A coat of many colours.</span>--Two explanations are given of this phrase; the first, that it was a long garment with sleeves or fringes; the other, that it was composed of patchwork of various colours. The latter is the more probable interpretation; for from the tomb at Beni-Hassan we learn that such dresses were worn in Palestine, as a train of captive Jebusites is represented upon it clad in rich robes, the patterns of which seem to have been produced by sewing together small pieces of different colours. So also in India beautiful dresses are made by sewing together strips of crimson, purple, and other colours. (Roberts' <span class= "ital">Oriental Illustrations, </span>p. 43.) Some have thought that Jacob by this dress marked out Joseph as the future head of the family, in the place of Reuben, supposing it to indicate the priestly office borne by the firstborn; but this is doubtful, and it was Judah to whom Jacob gave the right of primogeniture.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/37.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">Israel loved Joseph more than all his children</span> (literally, sons), <span class="cmt_word">because he was the son of his old age</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a son of old age</span> (was) he <span class="accented">to him</span>; not a son possessing the wisdom of advanced years (Onkelos), but a son born in his old age (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Kalisch, et <span class="accented">alii</span>), which was literally true of Joseph, since he was born in his father's ninety-first year. Yet as Joseph was only a year or two younger than the children of Bilhah and Zilpah, and as Benjamin was still later born than he, the application of this epithet to Joseph has been explained on the ground that Benjamin was at this time little more than a child (Keil), and had not much come into notice (Murphy), or perhaps was not born when this portion of the narrative was originally written ('Speaker's Commentary); or that Joseph had obtained the name before Benjamin's birth, and that it had clung to him after that event (Inglis). Josephus ('Ant.,' 2:02, 1) gives another reason for Jacob's partiality which is not inconsistent with the statement in the text, viz., the beauty of his person and the virtue of his mind, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And he made him a coat of many colors</span> - literally, <span class="accented">a coat</span> (<span class="accented">kithoneth</span>, from <span class="accented">kathan</span>, to cover; <span class="accented">vide Genesis</span> 3:21) of ends (Keil, Lange), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a tunic reaching to the ancles, and with sleeves reaching to the wrists, and commonly worn by boys and girls of the upper ranks (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 7:08, 9; <a href="/2_samuel/13-18.htm">2 Samuel 13:18</a>), or a coat of pieces (Kalisch, T.

"Such garments are represented on some of the monuments of Egypt. At Beni-Hassan, for example, there is a magnificent excavation forming the tomb of Pihrai, a military officer of Osirtasen I., in which a train of foreign captives appears, who are supposed to be Jebusites, an inscription over one person in the group reading, "The Chief of the Land of the Jebusites. 'The whole of the captives are clad in parti-colored garments, and the tunic of this individual in particular may be called "a coat of many colors" (Thornlcy Smith, 'Joseph and his Times,' p. 12). It has been supposed that Jacob's object in conferring this distinction on Joseph was to mark him out as the heir to whom the forfeited birthright of Reuben (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>) was to be transferred (Kurtz, Lange, Gerlach, Bush, Wordsworth, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc.); but the historian only mentions it as a token of affection, such as was customary in those times for princes to bestow upon their subjects, and parents on their children (vide Thornley Smith, 'Joseph and his Times,' p. 11). Roberts says the same thing is still done among the Hindoos, crimson, purple, and other colors being often tastefully sewed together for beautiful or favored children (<span class="accented">vide</span> 'Oriental Illustrations,' p. 43). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/37-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
