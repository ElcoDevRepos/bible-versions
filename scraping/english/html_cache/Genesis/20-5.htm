This action reflects the cultural practices of the time, where familial relationships could be used strategically for protection. It also underscores the human tendency to rely on self-preservation rather than fully trusting in God's promises. The repetition of this scenario in Abraham's life serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle between faith and fear.<p><b>And she herself said, &#8216;He is my brother.&#8217;</b><br>Sarah's participation in the deception indicates the complexity of their situation and the societal norms that might have influenced their decision. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, women often had limited agency, and Sarah's compliance could reflect her role within the patriarchal structure. This phrase also emphasizes the unity between Abraham and Sarah in their actions, despite the moral ambiguity. It serves as a reminder of the challenges faced by God's people in maintaining integrity amidst difficult circumstances.<p><b>I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.&#8221;</b><br>Abimelech's defense highlights the importance of intention and moral integrity. In the ancient world, the heart was seen as the center of thought and intention, while the hands symbolized actions. Abimelech's claim of innocence is significant, as it reflects a universal understanding of justice and righteousness that transcends cultural boundaries. This appeal to integrity and innocence is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>, which speaks of having clean hands and a pure heart. It underscores the biblical principle that God judges not only actions but also the intentions behind them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>- A patriarch in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.

The verse contrasts human deception with God&#8217;s watchful protection, showing that integrity of heart and innocence of hands matter to the Lord. It reminds believers to trust God rather than shade the truth, and it highlights God&#8217;s ability to safeguard His redemptive promises even when His people falter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">In the integrity of my heart . . . --</span>Not only does Abimelech assert this, but Elohim (see <a href="/genesis/20-6.htm" title="And God said to him in a dream, Yes, I know that you did this in the integrity of your heart; for I also withheld you from sinning against me: therefore suffered I you not to touch her.">Genesis 20:6</a>) admits the plea. And yet this Philistine king indulges in polygamy, and claims the right of taking the female relatives of any one passing through his territory to add them to his harem. But the words mean no more than that he was not consciously violating any of his own rules of morality, and thus illustrate the Gospel principle that men will be punished not by an absolute decree, but equitably, according to their knowledge (<a href="/context/luke/12-47.htm" title="And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.">Luke 12:47-48</a>). Abimelech was doing wrong, and was suffering punishment, but the punishment was remedial, and for his advancement in right-knowing and right-doing. It is thus by means of revelation that men have attained to a proper understanding of the moral law. Though often called "the law of Nature," yet Nature does not give it, but only acknowledges it when given. The inner light is but a faint and inconstant glimmering, but Christ is the true light; for only by Him does the law of Nature become a clear-rule for human guidance (<a href="/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>; <a href="/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-23.htm" title="But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness.
