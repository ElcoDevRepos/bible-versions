The act of falling upon his father's face signifies profound grief and love. In ancient Near Eastern culture, physical expressions of mourning were common, and this act demonstrates Joseph's respect and affection. The patriarchal relationship is central in Genesis, and Joseph's actions reflect the honor due to a father, aligning with the commandment to honor one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>).<p><b>wept over him</b><br>Weeping is a natural human response to loss and is frequently mentioned in the Bible as a sign of mourning. Joseph's weeping indicates his genuine sorrow and the depth of his loss. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical figures who wept over loved ones, such as David mourning for Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>). It also foreshadows the compassion of Jesus, who wept at the death of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), highlighting the humanity and empathy of both Joseph and Christ.<p><b>and kissed him</b><br>The act of kissing the deceased was a customary practice in ancient times, symbolizing farewell and love. This gesture underscores the personal and familial bonds that were highly valued in biblical narratives. It also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where physical touch was an important part of expressing emotions. The kiss can be seen as a final act of devotion, similar to the anointing of Jesus by Mary (<a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>), which was an expression of love and reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt.
