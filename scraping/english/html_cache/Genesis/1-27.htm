Unlike other creatures, humans are made in the "image" of God, suggesting a special relationship and responsibility. The concept of being made in God's image implies attributes such as rationality, morality, and the ability to have a relationship with God. This sets the foundation for the inherent dignity and worth of every human being. Theologically, this reflects the idea of humans as representatives of God's authority on earth, tasked with stewardship over creation (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The phrase also connects to the New Testament, where believers are called to be conformed to the image of Christ (<a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>), indicating a restoration of this original image marred by sin.<p><b>in the image of God He created him;</b><br>Repetition here underscores the importance of the concept. The singular "him" can be seen as a collective noun, representing humanity as a whole. This phrase reinforces the idea that every individual bears God's image, regardless of gender, race, or status. Historically, this understanding has been foundational for concepts of human rights and equality. Theologically, it points to the relational aspect of God, as humans are created to live in community, reflecting the relational nature of the Trinity. This also prefigures the incarnation of Christ, who is described as the "image of the invisible God" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), perfectly embodying what it means to be made in God's image.<p><b>male and female He created them.</b><br>This phrase highlights the intentional creation of gender, affirming both male and female as integral to God's design. It establishes the equality and complementarity of the sexes, each reflecting God's image in unique ways. Culturally, this was a radical affirmation in ancient times, where women often had lesser status. Theologically, it underscores the importance of relationships and community, as seen in the subsequent narrative of Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18-24</a>). This also foreshadows the unity and diversity within the body of Christ, where there is neither male nor female, but all are one in Christ Jesus (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The creation of male and female also points to the future union of Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-31.htm">Ephesians 5:31-32</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator, who is sovereign and omnipotent, responsible for the creation of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man (Humanity)</a></b><br>Refers to both male and female, created in the image of God, signifying the unique and special place of humans in creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The act of God bringing the universe and all life into existence, with humanity as the pinnacle of His creative work.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_imago_dei.htm">The Imago Dei (Image of God)</a></b><br>Humanity's creation in God's image signifies inherent dignity and worth.<br><br>This concept calls for respect and honor towards all people, regardless of differences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/gender_and_equality.htm">Gender and Equality</a></b><br>The creation of both male and female in God's image establishes the foundation for gender equality.<br><br>It challenges cultural norms that devalue or discriminate based on gender.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_and_responsibility.htm">Purpose and Responsibility</a></b><br>Being made in God's image implies a purpose to reflect His character and attributes.<br><br>It includes a responsibility to steward creation and live in a way that honors God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_and_value.htm">Identity and Value</a></b><br>Our identity is rooted in being God's image-bearers, not in societal status or achievements.<br><br>This truth provides a foundation for self-worth and combats feelings of inadequacy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_1_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 1:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_1_27_s_impact_on_identity_purpose.htm">How does Genesis 1:27 shape our understanding of human identity and purpose?

It indicates, first, that man has that in him which was not a development or evolution, but something new. He is, in fact, the most perfect work of the creative energy, and differs from the animals not only in degree, but in kind, though possessing, in common with them, an organised body. And next, it indicates the rejoicing of the Deity at the completion of His purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span> (or and) <span class="cmt_word">God created</span> (<span class="accented">bars</span>, as in vers. 1, 21, q.v.) <span class="cmt_word">man</span> (literally; the Adam referred to in ver. 26) <span class="cmt_word">in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them</span>. The threefold repetition of the term "created" should be observed as a significant negation of modern evolution theories as to the descent of man, and an emphatic proclamation of his Divine <span class="accented">original</span>. The threefold parallelism of the members of this verse is likewise suggestive, as Umbreit, Ewald, and Delitzsch remark, of the jubilation with which the writer contemplates the crowning work of Elohim's creative word. Murphy notices two stages in man's creation, the general fact being stated in the first clause of this triumphal song, and the two particulars - first his relation to his Maker, and second his sexual distinction - in its other members. In the third clause Luther sees an intimation "that the woman also was created by God, and made a partaker of the Divine image, and of dominion over all." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/1-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;
