It reflects a commitment to resolve matters promptly and with sincerity.<p><b>and swore an oath to each other.</b><br>Oaths were solemn promises made before God, binding the parties involved. In the ancient Near Eastern context, oaths were crucial for establishing trust and formalizing agreements. This oath between Isaac and Abimelech echoes the covenantal themes found throughout Genesis, such as God's covenant with Abraham. It underscores the importance of peace and mutual respect, even among those who were previously in conflict.<p><b>Then Isaac sent them on their way,</b><br>Sending them on their way indicates a formal conclusion to their meeting, suggesting that the terms of their agreement were satisfactory to both parties. This act of hospitality and respect is consistent with the cultural norms of the time, where hosting and sending off guests were significant social duties.<p><b>and they left him in peace.</b><br>Peace, or "shalom" in Hebrew, signifies more than the absence of conflict; it encompasses wholeness, harmony, and well-being. This outcome fulfills the biblical ideal of reconciliation and harmony among peoples. It also reflects God's promise to Isaac of blessing and protection, as seen earlier in <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-5</a>.
