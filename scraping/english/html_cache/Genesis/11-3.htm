It reflects the unity and shared purpose of the group, which is a recurring theme in the early chapters of Genesis. This unity, however, is directed towards a purpose that ultimately opposes God's command to fill the earth (<a href="/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>). The communal aspect of their decision can be contrasted with the individual obedience seen in figures like Noah.<p><b>&#8220;Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.&#8221;</b><br>The use of bricks signifies a technological advancement for the people of that time. In the Mesopotamian region, where the Tower of Babel narrative is set, natural stone was scarce, prompting the innovation of brick-making. This process involved baking clay bricks to harden them, making them more durable. The phrase suggests human ingenuity and self-reliance, which can be seen as a departure from reliance on God. This technological progress is not condemned in itself but becomes problematic when used to defy divine will.<p><b>So they used brick instead of stone</b><br>This substitution highlights the adaptability and resourcefulness of the people. In the ancient Near East, stone was often used for construction, but in the plains of Shinar, where the narrative is set, stone was not readily available. The choice to use brick instead of stone underscores the human desire to overcome natural limitations. This can be seen as a metaphor for humanity's attempt to assert independence from God, paralleling the pride and self-sufficiency that led to the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>and tar instead of mortar.</b><br>Tar, or bitumen, was a common adhesive in Mesopotamian construction due to its waterproof properties. This choice of materials indicates a sophisticated understanding of building techniques. The use of tar instead of traditional mortar suggests a desire for permanence and security in their construction, reflecting humanity's attempt to create a lasting legacy apart from God. This mirrors the later biblical theme of building on a firm foundation, as seen in Jesus' parable of the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>), where the true foundation is obedience to God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_shinar.htm">The People of Shinar</a></b><br>The collective group of people who settled in the land of Shinar, which is often associated with the region of Mesopotamia.

The text records an authentic Mesopotamian technique: kiln-fired bricks cemented with pitch.<p>- Substituting uniform bricks for varied stones hints at forced conformity&#8212;unity at the expense of diversity&#8212;anticipating God&#8217;s later scattering (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>- Tar (also used to seal Noah&#8217;s ark, <a href="/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a>) ironically connects this project to God&#8217;s preservation of Noah, yet here it is misapplied to defy Him.<p>- By relying on their own resources rather than seeking God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>), the people trust technology over obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-3.htm">Genesis 11:3</a> shows humanity rallying around a self-directed plan, crafting bricks and tar to build a monument of pride. Their cooperative spirit, technical skill, and determination are real and impressive, but they channel these gifts toward autonomy from their Creator. The verse thus sets the stage for God&#8217;s intervention, reminding us that lasting achievement begins with humble dependence on Him rather than with bricks fashioned by our own hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Let us make brick, and burn them throughly.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">for a burning. </span>Bricks in the East usually are simply dried in the sun, and this produces a sufficiently durable building material.

In fact, Mr. Layard says that at Birs-Nimroud it was scarcely possible to detach the bricks one from another, as the cement by which they were united was most tenacious (<span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon, </span>p. 499).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another</span>.
