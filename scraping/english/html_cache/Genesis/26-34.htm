This age is notable in the lives of several biblical figures, such as Moses, who spent forty years in Egypt, forty years in Midian, and forty years leading Israel. Esau's decision to marry at this age suggests a transition into a new phase of life, aligning with cultural expectations of adulthood and responsibility.<p><b>he took as his wives</b><br>Polygamy was a common practice in the ancient Near East, including among the patriarchs. However, it often led to familial strife, as seen in the lives of Abraham, Jacob, and others. Esau's choice to take multiple wives reflects the customs of his time but also foreshadows potential discord, as later events in Genesis reveal.<p><b>Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite</b><br>The Hittites were a significant group in the land of Canaan, known for their advanced culture and influence. Marrying a Hittite woman indicates Esau's integration into the local Canaanite society, which was contrary to the desires of his parents, Isaac and Rebekah, who preferred marriages within their own kin to preserve the covenantal line. This decision highlights Esau's disregard for the spiritual heritage of his family.<p><b>and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite</b><br>The repetition of Esau marrying another Hittite woman underscores his departure from the covenantal expectations. The name Basemath, meaning "fragrance" or "perfume," might suggest her attractiveness or social standing. This choice further alienates Esau from his family's values and foreshadows the tension between Esau and his parents, as well as the eventual separation of his descendants from the covenantal promises given to Abraham and Isaac.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The elder son of Isaac and Rebekah, known for selling his birthright to his brother Jacob for a meal.

At forty, Isaac had taken Rebekah as wife (<a href="/genesis/25-20.htm">Genesis 25:20</a>), so Esau is consciously mirroring his father&#8217;s timeline&#8212;but not his father&#8217;s faith.<p>&#8226; Forty in Scripture often marks completion or testing (e.g., <a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>). Esau&#8217;s test is whether he will honor the covenant line; his choice reveals his heart (<a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; His age also means full personal responsibility; he is no impulsive youth. The grief his marriage choices cause (<a href="/genesis/26-35.htm">Genesis 26:35</a>) cannot be blamed on immaturity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He took as his wives</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;took&#8221; underscores Esau&#8217;s initiative; he acts without seeking Isaac and Rebekah&#8217;s counsel, unlike Abraham&#8217;s careful arrangement for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; By taking two wives he embraces early polygamy, a practice first modeled by Lamech (<a href="/genesis/4-19.htm">Genesis 4:19</a>) and always portrayed as complicating family dynamics (<a href="/bsb/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>; <a href="/bsb/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1</a>).<p>&#8226; Esau&#8217;s disregard for spiritual compatibility foreshadows Israel&#8217;s later warnings: &#8220;You must not intermarry with them&#8230; for they will turn your sons away&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). His later attempt to &#8220;fix&#8221; the problem by marrying an Ishmaelite (<a href="/genesis/28-6.htm">Genesis 28:6-9</a>) shows he eventually realizes his error but misunderstands its root.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite</b><p>&#8226; The Hittites are Canaanites, people God would later command Israel to dispossess (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-17.htm">Deuteronomy 20:17</a>). Abraham had refused a Canaanite bride for Isaac (<a href="/genesis/24-3.htm">Genesis 24:3-4</a>), highlighting Esau&#8217;s spiritual insensitivity.<p>&#8226; Judith&#8217;s name appears only here and in <a href="/genesis/26-35.htm">Genesis 26:35</a>, where both wives are called &#8220;a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.&#8221; Their influence likely promotes idolatry, echoing later patterns such as Solomon&#8217;s foreign wives turning his heart (<a href="/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of her father &#8220;Beeri&#8221; roots the narrative in real history and underscores that this union binds Esau to Hittite clan alliances rather than covenant promises.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite</b><p>&#8226; A second Hittite wife compounds the problem&#8212;Esau isn&#8217;t merely careless; he is consistent.

Isaac and Rebekah&#8217;s later lament&#8212;&#8220;If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth&#8230; what good will my life be to me?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>)&#8212;springs directly from Esau&#8217;s precedent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Esau, at a mature and accountable age, chooses multiple wives from the pagan Hittites, ignoring the covenant priorities modeled by his grandfather Abraham and father Isaac.
