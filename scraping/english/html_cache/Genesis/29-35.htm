This phrase emphasizes God's ongoing provision and the fulfillment of His promise to Abraham regarding numerous descendants. Leah's fertility contrasts with Rachel's initial barrenness, setting the stage for future family dynamics and the unfolding of God's plan through Jacob's lineage.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This time I will praise the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>Leah's declaration marks a significant shift in her focus from seeking her husband's affection to acknowledging and praising God. This reflects a spiritual maturation and recognition of God's sovereignty in her life. The act of praising God is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with gratitude and acknowledgment of His works (e.g., <a href="/psalms/150.htm">Psalm 150</a>). Leah's decision to praise God for her son foreshadows the importance of Judah's lineage, from which King David and ultimately Jesus Christ would come.<p><b>So she named him Judah.</b><br>The name "Judah" means "praise" or "thanksgiving," directly correlating with Leah's expression of praise to God. Judah's significance extends beyond his birth, as he becomes the forefather of the tribe of Judah, one of the most prominent tribes in Israel. This tribe would later produce significant biblical figures, including King David and Jesus Christ, fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah coming from the line of Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-3</a>).<p><b>Then Leah stopped having children.</b><br>This phrase indicates a pause in Leah's childbearing, which may suggest a period of reflection or transition in her life. It also sets the stage for Rachel's eventual conception, balancing the family dynamics and continuing the narrative of God's providence and timing. Leah's temporary cessation of childbirth highlights the sovereignty of God in opening and closing the womb, a theme seen throughout the Bible (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah is often seen as the less favored wife compared to her sister Rachel.
