This act of naming signifies a transformation of the place into a sacred site. Bethel becomes a significant location in Israel's history, often associated with worship and divine revelation. It is here that Jacob acknowledges God's presence and the covenant promises made to his forefathers. Bethel later becomes a central place of worship for the Israelites, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a> and <a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>, where it is mentioned as a site of one of the golden calves set up by Jeroboam, indicating its continued religious significance.<p><b>though previously the city had been named Luz</b><br>Luz, the original name of the city, suggests a place that was known before Jacob's renaming. The renaming signifies a shift from a secular to a sacred identity, marking the location as a place of divine encounter. Luz is mentioned again in <a href="/judges/1-23.htm">Judges 1:23-26</a>, where the city is captured by the tribe of Joseph, indicating its strategic importance. The transformation from Luz to Bethel reflects a broader biblical theme of God transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary, paralleling the transformation of individuals who encounter God. This renaming also prefigures the transformative work of Christ, who redefines and redeems places and people for God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac and Rebekah, who is on a journey to find a wife from his mother's family.

Naming is an act of authority and testimony; by giving the site a new name he publicly marks what God has done (compare <a href="/genesis/2-19.htm">Genesis 2:19</a>; 32:28). Scripture shows many moments where a fresh experience with the LORD prompts a new name, underscoring that genuine faith always expresses itself in concrete action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that place</b><p>The word &#8220;place&#8221; ties back to <a href="/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>&#8212;Jacob had stopped at a seemingly ordinary spot. God&#8217;s presence turns an unremarkable location into holy ground (<a href="/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>). The emphasis reminds us that divine encounters are not limited to temples or sanctuaries; wherever the LORD meets His people becomes sacred.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bethel</b><p>&#8220;Bethel&#8221; means &#8220;house of God.&#8221; By this title Jacob captures the heart of his vision: a ladder uniting heaven and earth, angels ascending and descending, and the LORD standing above it (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12-13</a>). Calling it Bethel affirms:<p>&#8226; God is near, not distant (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Heaven&#8217;s resources are open to those in covenant with Him (<a href="/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>).<p>&#8226; The promise of land and offspring is anchored in God&#8217;s own presence (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>).<p>From this point forward Bethel becomes a significant worship center for Israel (<a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1-7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-3.htm">1 Samuel 10:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>though previously</b><p>These words contrast past and present. What Jacob once knew only as a stop on his journey is now transformed. Scripture often highlights the &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; to show God&#8217;s redemptive power (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-5</a>). The phrase invites reflection on how meeting the LORD redefines both places and people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the city had been named</b><p>A city&#8217;s name preserves its identity and history. Changing that name signals a fresh start under God&#8217;s purposes (<a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>). Jacob&#8217;s renaming asserts that the area&#8217;s future story will revolve around the covenant rather than its former associations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Luz</b><p>&#8220;Luz&#8221; was a Canaanite town (<a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>; <a href="/judges/1-23.htm">Judges 1:23</a>). The old name evokes a pagan past; the new name proclaims the presence of the living God. The shift from Luz to Bethel mirrors the believer&#8217;s journey from darkness to light (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>). Even geographic labels testify that when God steps in, everything changes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a> records Jacob&#8217;s act of renaming Luz as Bethel, turning an ordinary place into a lasting witness of God&#8217;s nearness and covenant faithfulness. Each phrase shows the progression&#8212;from Jacob&#8217;s decisive action, to the sanctifying of the spot, to the declaration that this is now the &#8220;house of God,&#8221; supplanting its former pagan identity. The verse calls us to recognize and mark the moments when the LORD meets us, allowing His presence to redefine our surroundings and our future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Beth-el </span>. . . <span class= "bld">Luz.</span>--In <a href="/context/joshua/16-1.htm" title="And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, to the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,">Joshua 16:1-2</a>, we find that Luz and Beth-el were distinct places, though near one another; and with this agrees the present passage. For plainly, Jacob and his attendants did not go inside the city, but slept on the open ground; and as they would carry their provisions with them, they would need no supplies from its Canaanite inhabitants. Probably at the time of Joshua's conquest Beth-el was rather a holy place than a town, and when Ephraim seized upon Luz and put the people to the sword (<a href="/context/judges/1-23.htm" title="And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)">Judges 1:23-25</a>), the victors transferred the name of Beth-el to it. Thus the spot where Jacob slept would not be the town of Beth-el, but some place a mile or two away from it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he called the name of that place Bethel</span> - i.e. a house of God. Rosenm&uuml;ller and Kalisch find a connection between Bethel and Baetylia, the former regarding Beetylia as a corruption of Bethel, and the latter viewing Bethel as the Hebraised form of Beetylion.

From the circumstances recorded in the narrative, Jacob called the spot where he slept (in the vicinity of Luz) Bethel - the designation afterwards extending to the town (<a href="/genesis/35-6.htm">Genesis 35:6</a>). Until the conquest both titles appear to have been used - Luz by the Canaanites, Bethel by the Israelites. When the conquest was completed the Hebrew name was substituted for the Hittite, the sole survivor of the captured city building another Luz in another part of the country (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/judges/1-26.htm">Judges 1:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/28-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1435;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
