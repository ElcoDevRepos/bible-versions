The intensity of childbirth in ancient times often led to life-threatening situations, as medical knowledge and resources were limited. Rachel's labor is a poignant moment, reflecting the harsh realities faced by women in biblical times. Her last breath signifies the culmination of her life journey, which began with her introduction in <a href="/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29</a> as Jacob's beloved wife.<p><b>for she was dying</b><br>Rachel's death during childbirth is a tragic event, emphasizing the fragility of life. Her death fulfills the sorrowful prophecy of <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>, where she expressed desperation for children. This moment also foreshadows the sorrow associated with Bethlehem, where Rachel is buried, and which later becomes significant in the prophecy of <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, referenced in <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a> concerning the massacre of the innocents.<p><b>she named him Ben-oni</b><br>The name "Ben-oni" means "son of my sorrow" or "son of my trouble," reflecting Rachel's anguish and the circumstances of his birth. Naming in the Bible often carries prophetic or symbolic significance, and Rachel's choice underscores the pain and loss she experiences. This moment connects to the broader biblical theme of names reflecting personal or divine encounters, as seen with Jacob's own name change to Israel.<p><b>But his father called him Benjamin</b><br>Jacob's decision to rename his son "Benjamin," meaning "son of the right hand" or "son of the south," signifies a shift from sorrow to strength and favor. The right hand is often associated with power and blessing in biblical literature, as seen in <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>. This renaming reflects Jacob's authority and hope for his son's future, aligning with the patriarchal tradition of bestowing names that convey destiny and identity. Benjamin's tribe later plays a significant role in Israel's history, producing notable figures like King Saul and the Apostle Paul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel.htm">Rachel</a></b><br>The beloved wife of Jacob, who is giving birth to her second son.

Scripture&#8217;s accuracy shows that both realities coexist: honest grief and forward-looking faith. The verse calls us to acknowledge pain while speaking God-centered hope over the next generation, believing He can transform loss into lasting blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/35.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Ben-oni . . .

Jacob's name, "son of the right hand," was probably given not merely that the child might-bear no ill-omened title, but to mark his sense of the value and preciousness of his last born son. Abravanel well remarks that earthly happiness is never perfect, and that the receiving of Divine revelations made no difference to Jacob's earthly lot. God had just solemnly appeared to him, and he is on his last journey, within two days' easy march of Hebron, when he loses the wife whom he so loved.
