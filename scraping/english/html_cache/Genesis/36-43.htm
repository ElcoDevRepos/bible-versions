The mention of Magdiel and Iram highlights the structured governance among the descendants of Esau. The names themselves, while not extensively detailed in other parts of Scripture, contribute to the understanding of the tribal organization and the importance of lineage and leadership in ancient cultures. The chiefs were likely responsible for maintaining order and overseeing the welfare of their respective clans.<p><b>These were the chiefs of Edom,</b><br>The term "chiefs" refers to leaders or tribal heads, suggesting a hierarchical society. Edom, located southeast of Israel, was a significant nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother. The Edomites often had contentious relations with Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament. This phrase underscores the established leadership and societal structure within Edom, which was recognized by neighboring nations.<p><b>according to their settlements in the land they possessed.</b><br>This indicates that the chiefs ruled over specific territories within Edom, emphasizing the importance of land ownership and territorial governance. The phrase suggests a settled, organized society with defined boundaries. The land they possessed was part of the inheritance given to Esau, fulfilling the promise of a nation made to him. This territorial possession is a recurring theme in the Bible, reflecting God's promises and the fulfillment of His word.<p><b>Esau was the father of the Edomites.</b><br>Esau, the twin brother of Jacob, is the patriarch of the Edomites. This statement connects the Edomites directly to the Abrahamic lineage, as Esau was the son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham. The relationship between Esau and Jacob is pivotal in biblical history, with Esau's descendants often in conflict with Israel. This phrase serves as a reminder of the familial ties and the fulfillment of God's promise to make Esau a great nation, despite his separation from the covenant line through Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/magdiel.htm">Magdiel</a></b><br>One of the chiefs of Edom, representing a clan or family within the Edomite nation.

is the first of the final two chiefs listed in Esau&#8217;s line (<a href="/genesis/36-43.htm">Genesis 36:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The name rounds out a roster that began earlier in the chapter (<a href="/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15&#8211;19</a>), showing God kept His promise that Esau would become &#8220;a nation and a people&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording even this lesser&#8211;known chief, Scripture underscores that no part of God&#8217;s covenant history is overlooked (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Centuries later, Edom&#8217;s chiefs would tremble before Israel&#8217;s God (<a href="/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>), confirming that the Lord who listed them also rules over them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Iram</b><p>&#8220;Iram&#8221; follows immediately after Magdiel, the last personal name in the genealogy.<p>&#8226; Including two more names after a long list reminds us that God traces every branch of the family tree (<a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Magdiel, Iram represents real people and real territory; this grounds the narrative in history, not legend (<a href="/1_chronicles/1-54.htm">1 Chronicles 1:54</a> repeats these names).<p>&#8226; Though little else is known of Iram, his mention affirms that all people&#8212;prominent or obscure&#8212;fit within God&#8217;s unfolding plan (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These were the chiefs of Edom</b><p>With the list completed, Moses pauses to label them &#8220;chiefs.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The term points to tribal leaders rather than kings (contrast <a href="/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>, &#8220;kings who reigned in Edom&#8221;), suggesting an organized but still clan&#8211;based society.<p>&#8226; Their authority fulfills Isaac&#8217;s blessing that Esau would &#8220;live by the sword&#8221; and enjoy some measure of dominion (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;chiefs&#8221; shows Edom&#8217;s cohesion as a people distinct from Israel, a theme echoed when Israel later met Edom on the wilderness march (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to their settlements in the land they possessed</b><p>This clause highlights geography and inheritance.<p>&#8226; Each chief ruled a defined settlement&#8212;literally &#8220;dwelling places&#8221;&#8212;pointing to permanent occupation of Mount Seir (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The wording recalls God&#8217;s earlier allotments: just as Canaan would belong to Jacob&#8217;s line, Seir now belongs to Esau&#8217;s (<a href="/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Territorial stability confirms God&#8217;s faithfulness to both brothers; He provides for Esau without compromising His special covenant with Jacob (<a href="/genesis/33-9.htm">Genesis 33:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Esau was the father of the Edomites</b><p>The verse&#8212;and the entire chapter&#8212;concludes by circling back to Esau himself.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Father&#8221; stresses origin and identity: every Edomite traces back to the twin who sold his birthright (<a href="/genesis/25-30.htm">Genesis 25:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminder frames future encounters: whether in the days of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13&#8211;14</a>), or the prophets (<a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8&#8211;10</a>), Israel is dealing with kin.<p>&#8226; The closing note also prepares readers for later theological reflections, such as <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2&#8211;4</a> and <a href="/romans/9-13.htm">Romans 9:13</a>, where God&#8217;s sovereign choice between Jacob and Esau illustrates grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/36-43.htm">Genesis 36:43</a> ties a bow on Esau&#8217;s genealogy by naming the final two chiefs, noting their settled territories, and re-anchoring the line in their forefather Esau. The verse showcases God&#8217;s meticulous record-keeping, His faithfulness to provide for Esau&#8217;s descendants, and the historical reality of the Edomite nation. Even in a brief list, Scripture invites us to see the Lord&#8217;s sovereign hand guiding families, allotting lands, and weaving every name into His larger redemptive story.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/36-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Magdiel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7713;&#183;d&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4025.htm">Strong's 4025: </a> </span><span class="str2">Magdiel -- 'excellence of God', an Edomite chief</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Iram.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5902.htm">Strong's 5902: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iram -- an Edomite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;
