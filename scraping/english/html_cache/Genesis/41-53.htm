This abundance was a divine blessing, allowing Egypt to prepare for the forthcoming famine. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, indicating a full cycle of prosperity.<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a significant ancient civilization, was known for its fertile Nile Delta, which allowed for agricultural prosperity. This abundance was not just a natural occurrence but orchestrated by God to fulfill His purposes. Egypt's role as a place of refuge and provision is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the lives of Abraham, Jacob, and later, Jesus.<p><b>came to an end</b><br>The end of the seven years marks the transition to the prophesied famine. This shift underscores the importance of heeding divine warnings and preparing accordingly. It also sets the stage for Joseph's rise to power and the eventual migration of his family to Egypt, which is pivotal in the unfolding of Israel's history. This transition from abundance to famine can be seen as a test of faith and reliance on God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man who, through God's guidance, rose to power in Egypt as Pharaoh's second-in-command.
