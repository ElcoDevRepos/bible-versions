This moment marks a significant shift in Judah's character, as he takes responsibility for the family's survival. The name "Israel" is used here to emphasize Jacob's role as the patriarch of the nation. This interaction highlights the familial dynamics and the importance of leadership and responsibility within the family unit.<p><b>&#8220;Send the boy with me,</b><br>Judah refers to Benjamin, the youngest son, as "the boy." This reflects the protective nature of the family towards Benjamin, especially after the loss of Joseph, whom they believe to be dead. Judah's willingness to take Benjamin under his care signifies a pledge of safety and responsibility, which is crucial given the previous loss of Joseph.<p><b>and we will go at once,</b><br>The urgency in Judah's words underscores the severity of the famine affecting Canaan. The phrase indicates a readiness to act immediately, reflecting the dire circumstances and the need for prompt action to secure food from Egypt. This urgency also demonstrates Judah's determination and leadership in ensuring the family's survival.<p><b>so that we may live and not die&#8212;</b><br>This phrase highlights the life-and-death situation faced by Jacob's family due to the famine. It underscores the desperation and necessity of their journey to Egypt. Theologically, it reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision and the preservation of His chosen people, which is a recurring motif throughout the Scriptures.<p><b>neither we, nor you, nor our children.</b><br>Judah's statement encompasses the entire family, emphasizing the collective threat posed by the famine. It reflects the communal nature of ancient Near Eastern societies, where the survival of the family unit was paramount. This phrase also foreshadows the future growth of Israel's descendants, as the preservation of the family is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham regarding his numerous offspring.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob (Israel), Judah plays a pivotal role in the account of Joseph and his brothers.
