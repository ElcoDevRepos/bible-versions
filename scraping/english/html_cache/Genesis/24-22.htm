In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, hospitality was a significant virtue, and Rebekah's willingness to water the camels demonstrated her character. Camels can drink large amounts of water, indicating Rebekah's diligence and kindness. This act fulfilled the servant's prayer for a sign, showing God's providence in guiding Abraham's servant to the right woman for Isaac.<p><b>he took out a gold ring weighing a beka</b><br>The gold ring, likely a nose ring, was a customary gift in ancient times, symbolizing wealth and status. A beka is half a shekel, a unit of weight used in the ancient world, indicating the ring's substantial value. This gift signifies the servant's recognition of Rebekah as the chosen bride for Isaac, aligning with the cultural practice of giving gifts to secure a marriage agreement.<p><b>and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels</b><br>The two gold bracelets further emphasize the wealth and seriousness of the marriage proposal. Ten shekels is a significant weight, underscoring the importance of the occasion. In biblical times, such gifts were part of the betrothal process, serving as a bride price or dowry. This act foreshadows the covenant relationship between God and His people, with the gifts symbolizing the blessings and promises associated with that covenant.
