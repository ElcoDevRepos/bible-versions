The term "attended" indicates God's active role in Sarah's life, emphasizing His personal care and intervention. This moment is a fulfillment of God's earlier promise to Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son (<a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16, 18</a>:10). It underscores the theme of divine faithfulness and the importance of God's timing, as Sarah had been barren for many years. This also reflects God's sovereignty and His ability to bring life and hope where there was none, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<p><b>as He had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the reliability and truthfulness of God's word. It refers back to God's specific promise to Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son (<a href="/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19, 18</a>:14). The fulfillment of this promise serves as a testament to God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His covenant. It also serves as a reminder that God's words are not empty but are always fulfilled in His perfect timing. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, where God's promises are consistently realized, reinforcing the trustworthiness of His word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>and the LORD did for Sarah</b><br>Here, the focus is on God's action in Sarah's life, demonstrating His power and grace. This action is a miraculous event, as Sarah was beyond the age of childbearing (<a href="/genesis/18-11.htm">Genesis 18:11</a>). It highlights God's ability to transcend natural laws and perform miracles. This act of God is a precursor to other miraculous births in the Bible, such as the birth of John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-7.htm">Luke 1:7, 13</a>) and ultimately, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18-23</a>). It illustrates God's intervention in human history to fulfill His redemptive plan.<p><b>what He had promised</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and Sarah. It emphasizes the certainty and reliability of God's promises, which are a central theme in the biblical narrative. The birth of Isaac is not only a personal fulfillment for Sarah but also a critical step in the unfolding of God's covenant with Abraham, which includes the promise of numerous descendants and the blessing of all nations through his lineage (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3, 22</a>:17-18). This event foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the promised seed of Abraham (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who fulfills His promises.

Scripture shows this kind of divine visitation as a hands-on act of mercy and power:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then the LORD visited Sarah as He had said&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1</a>a) underscores that the initiative is entirely His.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear in <a href="/exodus/4-31.htm">Exodus 4:31</a>, where &#8220;the LORD had visited the Israelites,&#8221; and in <a href="/1_samuel/2-21.htm">1 Samuel 2:21</a>, &#8220;The LORD attended to Hannah,&#8221; both revealing a pattern of God stepping in when human means are exhausted.<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds us of <a href="/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24</a>, where Joseph assures his brothers, &#8220;God will surely attend to you&#8221;. Each instance highlights a God who sees, remembers, and moves in love and power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as He had said</b><p>God&#8217;s action comes tethered to His prior word.
