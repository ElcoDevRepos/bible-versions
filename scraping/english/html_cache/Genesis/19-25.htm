These cities were notorious for their wickedness and sin, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>. The destruction serves as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to judge the cities if their sin was as grievous as reported. The destruction is often seen as a warning against immorality and a call to righteousness, echoed in later scriptures such as <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>, which references Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of divine judgment.<p><b>and the entire plain</b><br>The "plain" refers to the well-watered region of the Jordan Valley, which was initially chosen by Lot for its fertility (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-11</a>). This area was not only geographically significant but also economically prosperous, making its destruction a significant event. The obliteration of the entire plain underscores the totality of God's judgment, leaving no remnant of the sinful culture that had developed there.<p><b>including all the inhabitants of the cities</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the judgment, affecting every person living in the cities. The inhabitants' destruction is a direct consequence of their participation in the pervasive sinfulness of the region. This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the inevitability of divine justice, as seen in other biblical accounts of judgment, such as the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-8</a>.<p><b>and everything that grew on the ground</b><br>The destruction extended to the natural environment, indicating a complete eradication of life and productivity in the area. This mirrors the curse upon the ground seen in <a href="/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17-19</a>, where sin leads to a disruption of the natural order. The obliteration of vegetation also symbolizes the barrenness that results from sin, contrasting with the life and abundance found in obedience to God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>These were two cities known for their wickedness and sinfulness.
