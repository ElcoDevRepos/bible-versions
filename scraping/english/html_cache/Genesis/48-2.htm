Jacob, also known as Israel, is nearing the end of his life. The act of being told suggests the presence of others around him, likely his family or servants, who are attending to his needs. This moment sets the stage for a significant family event, highlighting the importance of communication in passing down blessings and heritage.<p><b>&#8220;Your son Joseph has come to you,&#8221;</b><br>Joseph, Jacob's beloved son, holds a special place in his heart, being the firstborn of Rachel, Jacob's favored wife. Joseph's arrival is significant because he is not only a son but also a powerful figure in Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. This visit underscores the reconciliation and restoration of the family, as Joseph had been separated from Jacob for many years. The mention of Joseph also foreshadows the blessings Jacob is about to bestow, which have implications for the future tribes of Israel.<p><b>Israel rallied his strength</b><br>The use of "Israel" instead of "Jacob" here is significant, as it reflects Jacob's God-given name, which denotes his role as the patriarch of the Israelite nation. Rallying his strength suggests a moment of divine empowerment or determination, as Jacob prepares to perform an important spiritual and familial duty. This act of gathering strength can be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite physical weakness, fulfills His mission with divine purpose.<p><b>and sat up in bed.</b><br>Sitting up in bed indicates a posture of readiness and authority. Despite his frailty, Jacob assumes a position that allows him to speak and act with intention. This physical movement symbolizes his readiness to impart blessings and prophetic words to his descendants. It reflects the cultural importance of the patriarchal blessing, a practice deeply rooted in the traditions of the ancient Near East, where the spoken word carried significant weight and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob/israel.htm">Jacob/Israel</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob is also known as Israel.

Hearing news often marks a turning point in Jacob&#8217;s life (<a href="/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26&#8211;28</a>; 46:2&#8211;4).<p>- Jacob has already walked with God for well over a century. Even now, every fresh word&#8212;especially about Joseph&#8212;gets his full attention, reminding us that God still speaks through ordinary messengers (cf. <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>- Earlier news of Joseph revived Jacob&#8217;s spirit (<a href="/genesis/45-27.htm">Genesis 45:27</a>). Here, another announcement prepares him for a final act of covenant blessing, underscoring that faith comes by hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Your son Joseph has come to you,&#8221;</b><p>- Joseph is more than a beloved son; he is God&#8217;s instrument for preserving the family (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). His coming signals both filial devotion and divine orchestration.<p>- Jacob&#8217;s anticipation of Joseph echoes their emotional reunion in Goshen (<a href="/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>). Then Joseph &#8220;wept on his neck.&#8221; Now he arrives for an even weightier moment&#8212;receiving patriarchal blessing.<p>- The phrase foregrounds relationship: father and son, shepherd and savior figure, echoing a pattern fulfilled ultimately in Christ, the Son who comes to His Father&#8217;s people (<a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel rallied his strength</b><p>- The name switch from Jacob to Israel reminds us of God-given identity (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). The patriarch, though frail, draws on covenant promises, not mere willpower (<a href="/genesis/47-29.htm">Genesis 47:29&#8211;31</a>; 49:1).<p>- Scripture records other saints mustering energy for a final testimony (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6&#8211;8</a>). Here, Israel&#8217;s physical rally mirrors spiritual resolve: God enables obedience, even in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>- This moment anticipates <a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>, where Israel&#8217;s end-of-life faith is celebrated. The strength he summons is a testimony that God finishes what He begins (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sat up in bed</b><p>- Sitting upright conveys authority and attentiveness, the posture of a patriarch about to bless (<a href="/genesis/48-12.htm">Genesis 48:12&#8211;14</a>; 49:33).<p>- Earlier, Jacob &#8220;bowed in worship&#8221; on his staff (<a href="/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>). Now he sits, signifying readiness to pass the torch of promise (cf. <a href="/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a>).<p>- His bed becomes a platform of faith. Though dying, Israel acts&#8212;illustrating that one can be physically confined yet spiritually fruitful (<a href="/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a>; <a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a> shows a frail yet faith-filled patriarch who, upon hearing that Joseph has arrived, musters God-given strength to sit up and prepare for covenant blessing.
