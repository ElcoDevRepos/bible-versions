The visitors, who are angels in disguise, had come to Sodom to assess the city's wickedness (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>). The timing underscores the urgency and severity of the situation, as Lot's hospitality is interrupted before the night has even begun.<p><b>all the men of the city of Sodom</b><br>The phrase highlights the collective nature of the sin in Sodom. The city's reputation for wickedness is well-documented in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/13-13.htm">Genesis 13:13</a>), and this event exemplifies the extent of its moral decay. The use of "all the men" suggests a pervasive corruption, indicating that the sin was not limited to a few individuals but was a societal norm. This collective sinfulness is later referenced in <a href="/jude/1-7.htm">Jude 1:7</a>, which describes Sodom's actions as an example of immorality and divine judgment.<p><b>both young and old</b><br>This detail emphasizes the widespread nature of the corruption, affecting every generation. It suggests that the moral depravity of Sodom was ingrained in its culture, passed down from one generation to the next. This generational sin contrasts with the biblical ideal of teaching righteousness to one's children (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). The inclusion of both young and old underscores the totality of the city's wickedness and the absence of righteous influence.<p><b>surrounded the house</b><br>The act of surrounding Lot's house indicates an aggressive and hostile intent. This imagery of encirclement is often used in Scripture to depict danger or impending judgment (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12-13</a>). The men of Sodom's actions reflect a complete disregard for the sanctity of Lot's home and the protection it should have offered to his guests. This scene foreshadows the impending divine judgment on Sodom, as the city's sin has reached its full measure (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>). The surrounding of the house also serves as a stark contrast to the protection and refuge found in God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, where the angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>A righteous man living in Sodom, nephew of Abraham, who offers hospitality to the visiting angels.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Divine messengers sent by God to assess the wickedness of Sodom and to rescue Lot and his family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_sodom.htm">Men of Sodom</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the city, described as wicked and sinful, who surround Lot's house with evil intentions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom.htm">Sodom</a></b><br>A city known for its grave sinfulness, ultimately destroyed by God due to its wickedness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_lot.htm">House of Lot</a></b><br>The setting of the event, where Lot hosts the angels and where the men of Sodom gather.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The account of Sodom serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of unchecked sin and rebellion against God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_righteousness.htm">The Importance of Righteousness</a></b><br>Lot's presence in Sodom highlights the call for believers to live righteously even in corrupt environments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hospitality_and_protection.htm">Hospitality and Protection</a></b><br>Lot's actions demonstrate the biblical value of hospitality and the protection of guests, reflecting God's care for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_mercy.htm">Divine Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>While God's judgment is evident in the destruction of Sodom, His mercy is shown in the rescue of Lot and his family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_influence.htm">Community Influence</a></b><br>The collective sin of Sodom illustrates the powerful influence a community can have, for better or worse, on individuals.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_19_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 19:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_19_4_Sodom_s_men_s_morality.htm">What does Genesis 19:4 reveal about the moral state of Sodom's men?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_resist_anti-God_societal_norms.htm">How can we guard against societal influences that oppose God's standards today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Gen_19_4_Rom_1_24-27_Similarities.htm">Compare Genesis 19:4 with Romans 1:24-27.
