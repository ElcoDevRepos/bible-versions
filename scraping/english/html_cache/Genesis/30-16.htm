The field represents his work and livelihood, as Jacob was tending Laban's flocks. This setting underscores the agrarian lifestyle of the patriarchs and the importance of pastoral work in their lives. The evening time is significant as it was a customary time for rest and family interaction, highlighting the domestic setting of the narrative.<p><b>Leah went out to meet him</b><br>Leah's proactive approach in meeting Jacob indicates her desire and determination to secure his attention and affection. This action reflects the ongoing rivalry between Leah and her sister Rachel for Jacob's love and the struggle for status within the family. Leah's initiative can be seen as a reflection of her longing for validation and her role as a wife in a polygamous marriage, which was culturally accepted but often led to familial tension.<p><b>and said, &#8220;You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son&#8217;s mandrakes.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of mandrakes, a plant believed to have fertility-enhancing properties, highlights the cultural beliefs and practices surrounding fertility and childbearing in the ancient Near East. Leah's use of mandrakes to "hire" Jacob underscores the transactional nature of their relationship at this point, as well as the desperation and competition between the sisters. This incident also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over human efforts, as ultimately, it is God who opens and closes the womb (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>).<p><b>So he slept with her that night.</b><br>Jacob's compliance with Leah's request demonstrates the complex dynamics of his family life, where personal desires and familial obligations intersect. This phrase also points to the fulfillment of Leah's desire for intimacy and the continuation of the lineage through her offspring. The narrative of Jacob's family, with its struggles and divine interventions, foreshadows the eventual formation of the twelve tribes of Israel, each tribe descending from Jacob's sons.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelite tribes, son of Isaac and Rebekah, and husband to Leah and Rachel.

The mandrakes, valued for enhancing fertility, symbolize Leah&#8217;s hope for further children.<p>&#8226; The language of &#8220;hired&#8221; highlights the painful rivalry created by Laban&#8217;s deception (<a href="/genesis/29-23.htm">Genesis 29:23-25</a>). Marital intimacy has become a negotiated commodity, revealing the brokenness sin introduces even into covenant families (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God is not absent. He will use this flawed transaction to advance His redemptive plan, much like He later employs Ruth&#8217;s bold request of Boaz (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he slept with her that night</b><p>&#8226; Scripture records the fact without apology, emphasizing God&#8217;s sovereignty over the womb: &#8220;God listened to Leah, and she conceived&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This union results in Issachar, whose name speaks of reward (<a href="/genesis/30-18.htm">Genesis 30:18</a>). The Lord again honors Leah&#8217;s desire, echoing <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>: &#8220;Children are a heritage from the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s compliance, though passive here, keeps intact the patriarchal line through which the Messiah will come (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>). God works even in imperfect choices to fulfill His promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/30-16.htm">Genesis 30:16</a> shows Leah&#8217;s bold claim on Jacob for that evening, secured by trading mandrakes with Rachel. The verse unveils family tension, human bargaining, and longing for love, yet God remains at work. Through Leah&#8217;s initiative and Jacob&#8217;s return from the fields, the covenant family grows, demonstrating that the Lord can weave His purposes through ordinary moments and flawed motives, turning them into blessings that advance His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob came out of the field in the evening</span>, - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the harvest-field (ver. 14) - <span class="cmt_word">and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me</span> (the Samaritan codex adds "this night," and the LXX.
