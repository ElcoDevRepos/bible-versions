Previously, in <a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>, Abraham employed a similar tactic in Egypt. The cultural context of the time allowed for such half-truths, as Sarah was indeed his half-sister (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>). This action reflects a lack of trust in God's protection, despite God's promises to Abraham. It also foreshadows the struggles of faith and obedience that Abraham's descendants would face.<p><b>So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.</b><br>Gerar was a Philistine city located in the Negev region, which is modern-day southern Israel. Abimelech, a common title for Philistine kings, similar to "Pharaoh" in Egypt, took Sarah into his household, believing her to be unmarried. This incident parallels the earlier event in Egypt, emphasizing the vulnerability of the patriarchal family and the potential threat to the promise of a son through Sarah. The narrative underscores God's sovereignty and protection over His covenant people, as He intervenes to preserve Sarah's integrity and the lineage of the promised seed. This event also prefigures the protective role God plays in the lives of His people, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who safeguards His church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith in God.

He has arrived in Gerar and, just as he did in Egypt years earlier (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11-13</a>), he decides to speak a half-truth for self-protection instead of trusting the covenant-keeping God who promised, &#8220;I am your shield&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>). We watch the father of believers choose calculation over confidence:<p>&#8226; The setting is a pagan territory; Abraham assumes hostility and danger, yet no threat has been voiced.<p>&#8226; His words reveal inner anxiety; contrast this with David&#8217;s later assurance, &#8220;When I am afraid, I put my trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The lapse is striking because God had just renewed His promise of a son through Sarah (<a href="/genesis/18-10.htm">Genesis 18:10&#8211;14</a>); unbelief surfaces right after divine reassurance, a pattern echoed in Elijah&#8217;s flight after Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of his wife Sarah</b><p>Sarah is not merely Abraham&#8217;s spouse; she is the vessel through whom God will bring Isaac (<a href="/genesis/17-15.htm">Genesis 17:15-19</a>). To speak of her in any way that diminishes that role risks the very promise itself.<p>&#8226; Peter later points to Sarah as an example of godly submission (<a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>), yet that commendation does not absolve Abraham from leading courageously.<p>&#8226; The narrative underscores marital unity: &#8220;the two shall become one flesh&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Treating Sarah as anything less than wife violates God&#8217;s original design.<p>&#8226; Even in human failure, God preserves Sarah&#8217;s dignity, foreshadowing how He protects His people from schemes beyond their control (<a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She is my sister</b><p>The statement is technically accurate (she is his half-sister; cf. <a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a>) yet morally deceptive. Scripture consistently condemns deceit (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Abraham repeats a pattern: Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>) and now Gerar. Sin unconfessed tends to recycle.<p>&#8226; Isaac will mimic the same lie with Rebekah (<a href="/genesis/26-7.htm">Genesis 26:7</a>), showing how parental choices echo in children.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s care does not endorse the tactic; His faithfulness shines in spite of human manipulation (<a href="/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Abimelech king of Gerar</b><p>Abimelech, whose name means &#8220;my father is king,&#8221; governs a Philistine city-state. He acts on the information presented, believing Sarah is available for alliance or marriage.<p>&#8226; The episode reminds us that unbelievers can display more integrity than believers; Abimelech later protests his innocence (<a href="/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4-5</a>), much as Pharaoh rebuked Abraham earlier (<a href="/genesis/12-18.htm">Genesis 12:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty extends over pagan rulers; He appears to Abimelech in a dream (<a href="/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>), echoing later interventions with Laban (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>) and Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Had Sarah brought to him</b><p>In ancient Near-Eastern culture, taking a woman into the royal harem signified political alliance and protection.

Divine protection overrides royal prerogative.<p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s scheme could have jeopardized the covenant seed, but God guards His redemptive plan, just as He will later preserve Israel from Pharaoh&#8217;s massacre (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22&#8211;2</a>:10) and Herod&#8217;s slaughter (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>&#8212;&#8220;There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan that can succeed against the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/20-2.htm">Genesis 20:2</a> portrays a faithful God rescuing fallible believers from self-made danger. Abraham&#8217;s fear-driven half-truth exposes the frailty of even the greatest patriarch, yet God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to His promise safeguards Sarah, upholds marriage, and advances the covenant line. The verse calls us to trust the Lord&#8217;s protection rather than resorting to deception, confident that His purposes cannot be thwarted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">She is my sister.</span>--Twenty years before, Abraham had acted in the same way in Egypt, and Pharaoh had rebuked him, but sent him away with large presents. We learn from this chapter, <a href="/genesis/20-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you shall show to me; at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.">Genesis 20:13</a>, that the false representation which twice brought them into trouble was habitual with the two; nor does Abraham ever seem conscious that he was acting in it wrongfully. To us it seems cowardly, in one who had so many men trained to battle, thus to expose his wife to danger; and to have recourse to deceit, at the very time when such abundant revelations were being made to him, also shows an apparent want of faith in God. But Holy Scripture neither represents its heroes as perfect, nor does it raise them disproportionately above the level of their own times. Its distinguishing feature rather is that it ever insists upon a perpetual progress upwards, and urges men onward to be better and holier than those that went before. Abraham was not on the same high spiritual level as a Christian ought to be who has the perfect example of Christ as his pattern, and the gift of the Holy Ghost for his aid; and the fact that God rescued him and Sarah from all danger in Egypt may have seemed to him a warrant that in future difficulties he would have the same Divine protection. Human conduct is ever strangely chequered, but we have a wholesome lesson in the fact, that it was Abraham's politic device which twice entangled him in actual danger.<p><span class= "bld">Abimelech (called in <a href="/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.

Some, however, think that with the promise of a son her youth had been renewed, while others suppose that the purpose uppermost in the mind of Abimelech was political, and that what he really desired was an alliance with the powerful sheik who had entered his territories.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister</span>. As formerly he had done on descending into Egypt (<a href="/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>). That Abraham should a second time have resorted to this ignoble expedient after the hazardous experience of Egypt and the richly-merited rebuke of Pharaoh, but more especially after the assurance he had lately received of his own acceptance before God (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>), and of Sarah's destiny to be the mother of the promised seed (<a href="/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16</a>), is well nigh unaccountable, and almost irreconcilable with any degree of faith and piety. Yet the lapse of upwards of twenty years since that former mistake may have deadened the impression of sinfulness which Pharaoh's rebuke must have left upon his conscience; while altogether the result of that experiment may, through a common misinterpretation of Divine providence, have encouraged him to think that God would watch over the purity of his house as he had done before. Thus, though in reality a tempting of God, the patriarch's repetition of his early venture may have had a secret connection with his deeply-grounded faith in the Divine promise (cf.
