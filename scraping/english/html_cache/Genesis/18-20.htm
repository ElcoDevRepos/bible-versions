It reflects the personal nature of God, who speaks and reveals His will. This is consistent with other instances in Genesis where God speaks directly to individuals, such as Adam, Noah, and Abraham.<p><b>The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great.</b><br>The term "outcry" suggests a cry for justice due to the severe wickedness of these cities. Sodom and Gomorrah were located in the region of the Dead Sea, and archaeological evidence suggests they were prosperous but morally corrupt. The "outcry" can be seen as a collective call from those oppressed or harmed by the cities' actions, similar to the cries of the oppressed in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>. This highlights God's concern for justice and righteousness.<p><b>Because their sin is so grievous,</b><br>The grievous nature of their sin indicates extreme moral depravity. The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah are later detailed in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>, including sexual immorality and lack of hospitality. <a href="/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49-50</a> also describes their sins as pride, excess, and neglect of the poor. This phrase underscores the severity of their actions, warranting divine judgment. The destruction of these cities serves as a warning and a type of final judgment, foreshadowing the ultimate judgment described in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The divine being speaking in this passage, often understood as God in the Christian tradition.
