This reflects the cultural importance of honor and agreement in ancient Near Eastern societies. The steward, acting on Joseph's behalf, is a key figure in the unfolding narrative, representing Joseph's authority and intentions.<p><b>&#8220;But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave,</b><br>This phrase introduces the test of integrity and loyalty among Joseph's brothers. The cup, a symbol of authority and divination, is strategically placed to reveal the brothers' character. The concept of slavery here is significant, as it echoes Joseph's own past when he was sold into slavery by his brothers. This situation serves as a test of repentance and change in the brothers' hearts, particularly Judah, who later offers himself in place of Benjamin, prefiguring Christ's substitutionary atonement.<p><b>and the rest of you shall be free of blame.&#8221;</b><br>This statement offers a conditional release, highlighting themes of justice and mercy. It reflects the biblical principle that each person is accountable for their own actions, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>. The offer of freedom to the others underscores the importance of individual responsibility and the potential for redemption, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.

Our spoken commitments matter.<p>&#8226; By allowing the brothers&#8217; statement to stand, the steward subtly highlights their accountability before both Joseph and God (<a href="/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied the steward.</b><p>&#8226; The unnamed steward acts under Joseph&#8217;s direct authority, much like other trusted servants in Genesis (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; 39:4).<p>&#8226; His role illustrates how God can work through delegated representatives to accomplish larger purposes (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Though a mere servant, he speaks with the full weight of Joseph&#8217;s command, foreshadowing how believers today carry Christ&#8217;s message (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But only the one who is found with the cup</b><p>&#8226; The focus narrows from collective guilt to individual responsibility (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s silver cup is the divinely permitted instrument that &#8220;finds out&#8221; the hidden matter (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, &#8220;&#8230;your sin will find you out&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This test targets Benjamin, pressing the brothers to prove whether they will abandon the favored son as they once abandoned Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-26.htm">Genesis 37:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be my slave,</b><p>&#8226; Slavery represents the just consequence for the discovered offense (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>, &#8220;You are slaves of the one you obey&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The penalty is severe yet measured, avoiding the death the brothers themselves had rashly suggested (<a href="/genesis/44-9.htm">Genesis 44:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it illustrates how sin brings bondage, but also how God can turn discipline into redemption (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the rest of you shall be free of blame.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Innocence is honored; those not holding the cup are released (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, &#8220;A son shall not be put to death for his father&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The separation between guilty and innocent foreshadows substitutionary themes later fulfilled in Christ, who bears sin so others may go free (<a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This merciful verdict invites the brothers to stand with Benjamin voluntarily, revealing their transformed hearts (<a href="/genesis/44-33.htm">Genesis 44:33&#8211;34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-10.htm">Genesis 44:10</a> underscores spoken accountability, delegated authority, individual responsibility, just consequence, and merciful distinction. Through the steward&#8217;s words, God stages a heart-revealing test: will the brothers accept responsibility and protect Benjamin, or will they abandon him? The verse therefore prepares the scene for Judah&#8217;s self-sacrificial plea and, ultimately, for family reconciliation&#8212;demonstrating God&#8217;s faithful orchestration of events to expose sin, foster repentance, and extend grace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;As you say,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#601;&#183;&#7695;i&#7687;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
