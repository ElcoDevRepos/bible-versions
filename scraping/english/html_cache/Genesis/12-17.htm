The plagues serve as a divine response to Pharaoh's unwitting transgression, echoing later events in Exodus where God sends plagues upon Egypt to liberate the Israelites. The use of plagues as a divine tool underscores God's power and foreshadows the more extensive plagues that would later afflict Egypt. This intervention also emphasizes the sanctity of marriage and God's protection over the covenant He made with Abram.<p><b>because of Abram&#8217;s wife Sarai.</b><br>Sarai, later known as Sarah, is central to God's covenant with Abram, as she is to be the mother of the promised offspring. Her presence in Pharaoh's household, due to Abram's earlier deception, places the covenant at risk. This situation illustrates the importance of faith and trust in God's promises, as Abram's fear led to a lack of faith, resulting in unintended consequences. The protection of Sarai ensures the continuation of God's plan for Abram's descendants, who are to become a great nation. This incident also prefigures the concept of divine protection over the lineage that would eventually lead to Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abram's seed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who intervenes in human affairs to protect His promises and His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, representing the power and authority of a major ancient civilization.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is the patriarch of the Israelite nation, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sarai.htm">Sarai</a></b><br>Later known as Sarah, she is Abram's wife, through whom God's promise of a great nation would be fulfilled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant ancient civilization where Abram and Sarai sought refuge during a famine, leading to the events of this passage.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_protection.htm">God's Sovereignty and Protection</a></b><br>God actively intervenes to protect His covenant people and fulfill His promises, even when they make mistakes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deception.htm">The Consequences of Deception</a></b><br>Abram's deception led to unintended consequences, reminding us of the importance of truthfulness and trust in God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>The passage underscores the importance of honoring and protecting the marital relationship, as it is central to God's plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_despite_human_failure.htm">God's Faithfulness Despite Human Failure</a></b><br>Even when Abram failed to trust God fully, God remained faithful to His promises, showing His grace and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_sin_on_others.htm">The Impact of Sin on Others</a></b><br>Abram's actions had repercussions not only for himself but also for Pharaoh and his household, highlighting the broader impact of our choices.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_12_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 12:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_12_17_God_s_covenant_protection.htm">How does Genesis 12:17 demonstrate God's protection over His covenant with Abram?
