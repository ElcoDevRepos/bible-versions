In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, hospitality was a significant virtue. Asking for a drink was a common request, but the servant's prayer for a specific response indicates his desire for a clear sign from God. This act of drawing water was labor-intensive, highlighting the servant's need for a woman of both kindness and diligence.<p><b>and who responds, &#8216;Drink, and I will water your camels as well&#8217;&#8212;</b><br>The offer to water camels goes beyond customary hospitality, as camels can drink large amounts of water, making this a considerable task. This response would demonstrate the woman's generosity and willingness to serve, qualities valued in a matriarch. The act of watering camels also symbolizes abundance and provision, echoing themes of God's provision throughout Scripture.<p><b>let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac.</b><br>The servant seeks God's guidance in choosing a wife for Isaac, emphasizing the belief in divine sovereignty over human affairs. This reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s involvement in the covenant lineage, ensuring that Isaac's wife would be part of His divine plan. The concept of divine appointment is seen throughout the Bible, where God chooses individuals for specific purposes, such as David being chosen as king.<p><b>By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.&#8221;</b><br>The servant's request for a sign is not just for his own assurance but as a confirmation of God's continued faithfulness to Abraham. The term "kindness" (Hebrew: "chesed") is a covenantal term, often used to describe God's loyal love and faithfulness. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's steadfast love and the fulfillment of His promises, as seen in His covenant with Abraham and his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, likely Eliezer, is tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.
