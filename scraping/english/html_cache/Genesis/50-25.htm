This reflects the importance of oaths in ancient Near Eastern culture, where spoken promises were considered binding and sacred. The act of making an oath also signifies the seriousness of Joseph's request and his faith in God's promises to his forefathers. Oaths were often used to ensure future actions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-9</a> when Abraham made his servant swear to find a wife for Isaac from his own people.<p><b>and said, &#8220;God will surely attend to you,</b><br>Joseph expresses his unwavering faith in God's providence and future deliverance of Israel. This statement is prophetic, anticipating the Exodus when God would indeed "attend" to the Israelites by delivering them from Egyptian bondage. It echoes God's covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, where God foretold the enslavement and eventual liberation of Abraham's descendants. Joseph's confidence in God's faithfulness serves as a model of trust for believers.<p><b>and then you must carry my bones up from this place.&#8221;</b><br>Joseph's request to have his bones carried to the Promised Land signifies his deep connection to God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the importance of the land promised by God and Joseph's desire to be part of that promise even in death. This act prefigures the Exodus, as Joseph's bones were indeed carried out of Egypt by Moses, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>. It also symbolizes the hope of resurrection and eternal life, themes that are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate deliverer and fulfiller of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The eleventh son of Jacob, who rose to prominence in Egypt.

This is not a casual request; an oath binds the family to God&#8217;s own witness (<a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The oath transfers responsibility from Joseph to the covenant family. Their collective name, &#8220;sons of Israel,&#8221; reminds them that their obligation is tied to God&#8217;s covenant with their father Jacob/Israel (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By asking for an oath, Joseph shows he fully expects God&#8217;s future deliverance, but also knows the family might forget amid Egyptian prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God will surely attend to you</b><p>&#8220;God will surely attend to you&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The double assurance&#8212;literally &#8220;visiting He will visit&#8221;&#8212;underscores certainty. Joseph rests on God&#8217;s promise to Abraham that after four hundred years of affliction, the LORD would &#8220;judge the nation they serve, and afterward they will come out with great possessions&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s confidence models faith for later generations (<a href="/hebrews/11-22.htm">Hebrews 11:22</a>). Even at death he speaks as though the Exodus is already scheduled.<p>&#8226; The phrase points to God&#8217;s personal involvement: the same God who &#8220;attended&#8221; Sarah (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1</a>) will &#8220;attend&#8221; Israel. His presence guarantees both deliverance and guidance (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you must carry my bones up from this place</b><p>&#8220;and then you must carry my bones up from this place&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s instruction is literal. He wants his remains taken to Canaan, affirming that Egypt is not Israel&#8217;s home. When Moses leaves Egypt, he faithfully &#8220;took the bones of Joseph with him&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The burial site in Shechem (<a href="/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>) fulfills Joseph&#8217;s request and roots the nation in God&#8217;s land promises (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>).<p>&#8226; His bones become a tangible reminder through centuries of slavery, wilderness wanderings, and conquest that God keeps covenant promises (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s faith-filled command challenges every generation to live as pilgrims, looking forward to God&#8217;s prepared homeland (<a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>; <a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joseph&#8217;s dying words fuse faith and foresight. By binding his family with an oath, he locks their future to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. By declaring that God will surely attend to them, he anchors them in divine certainty. By insisting his bones be carried to Canaan, he proclaims that Egypt is temporary and God&#8217;s promises are permanent. <a href="/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a> therefore stands as a testament to confident trust: God will visit, deliver, and plant His people where He has sworn&#8212;no matter how long it takes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/50-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1428;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">take an oath</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;ba&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
