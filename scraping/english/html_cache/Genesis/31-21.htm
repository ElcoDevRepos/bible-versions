This action reflects his desire to break free from Laban's control and return to his homeland. The possessions he takes include his family, livestock, and wealth accumulated during his time with Laban. This mirrors the Exodus narrative, where the Israelites leave Egypt with their possessions, signifying God's provision and blessing. Jacob's flight also fulfills God's promise to be with him and bring him back to the land of his fathers (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>).<p><b>crossed the Euphrates</b><br>The Euphrates River is one of the most significant rivers in the ancient Near East, often serving as a boundary marker. Crossing it symbolizes a transition from one phase of life to another. In biblical history, the Euphrates is frequently mentioned as a boundary of the Promised Land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). Jacob's crossing can be seen as a step towards fulfilling God's covenant with Abraham, as he moves closer to the land promised to his descendants.<p><b>and headed for the hill country of Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its rugged terrain and balm, a valuable resin used for healing. This area later becomes significant in Israel's history, serving as a place of refuge and conflict. Jacob's choice to head towards Gilead indicates his strategic planning to avoid confrontation with Laban and to find a safe haven. The hill country of Gilead also foreshadows future events, such as the division of the tribes and the establishment of cities of refuge. In a typological sense, Gilead can be seen as a place of healing and restoration, pointing to Christ as the ultimate healer and refuge for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is fleeing from his father-in-law Laban.
