The repetition suggests a calculated attempt to manipulate the situation. In biblical narratives, repetition often emphasizes deceit or the importance of the message. This mirrors the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where falsehood is used to alter perception and reality.<p><b>The Hebrew slave you brought us:</b><br>Referring to Joseph as "the Hebrew slave" highlights his outsider status in Egyptian society. Hebrews were often seen as foreigners, and this designation underscores Joseph's vulnerability. The term "slave" is used pejoratively, diminishing Joseph's integrity and accomplishments. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people being strangers in foreign lands, as seen in <a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8-14</a>, where the Israelites are oppressed in Egypt.<p><b>came to me:</b><br>This phrase suggests an unwanted advance, framing Joseph as the aggressor. In the cultural context of ancient Egypt, a slave's word held little weight against that of a master's wife. This accusation is a pivotal moment in Joseph's life, leading to his imprisonment. It parallels the false accusations faced by Jesus, who was also unjustly condemned despite his innocence (<a href="/matthew/26-59.htm">Matthew 26:59-61</a>).<p><b>to make sport of me:</b><br>The phrase "make sport of me" implies mockery or attempted seduction. In the ancient Near East, honor and reputation were paramount, and such an accusation would have been scandalous. This reflects the recurring biblical theme of the righteous suffering unjustly, as seen in the trials of Job. Joseph's integrity in the face of false accusations prefigures Christ's own suffering and steadfastness under false charges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew slave in Egypt, known for his integrity and faithfulness to God.

Earlier, she had shouted to the household servants, &#8220;Look, he has brought us a Hebrew to make sport of us&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>). Now she re-packages the same tale for Potiphar, showing deliberate persistence in bearing false witness. Scripture warns against this sin: &#8220;You shall not spread a false report&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>). False testimony also appears in Jesus&#8217; trial, where &#8220;many bore false witness against Him&#8221; (<a href="/mark/14-56.htm">Mark 14:56</a>), underlining a pattern: the righteous are often slandered, yet God ultimately vindicates them (<a href="/psalms/37-6.htm">Psalm 37:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Hebrew slave</b><p>By emphasizing Joseph&#8217;s ethnicity and status, she fuels prejudice and plants doubt in Potiphar&#8217;s mind. This mirrors how the Egyptians later dehumanized the Hebrews, making them &#8220;slaves with crushing burdens&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>). Calling Joseph &#8220;Hebrew&#8221; rather than his name erases his personal faithfulness and reduces him to an outsider, much like Goliath&#8217;s scornful &#8220;Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?&#8221; toward David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>). God repeatedly elevates those the world dismisses, reminding us of His heart for the lowly (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you brought us</b><p>Potiphar&#8217;s wife shifts blame to her husband, implying that the real fault lies with his decision to hire Joseph. A similar deflection occurred in Eden when Adam said, &#8220;The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a>). Aaron also shifted guilt when Israel worshiped the golden calf: &#8220;You yourself know how prone these people are to evil&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22-24</a>). This tactic clouds the truth, poisons relationships, and obscures personal responsibility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>She paints herself as the innocent victim. Yet the chapter previously detailed her relentless pursuit of Joseph (&#8220;day after day,&#8221; <a href="/genesis/39-10.htm">Genesis 39:10</a>). Her words echo Amnon&#8217;s deceit before assaulting Tamar, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/13-11.htm">2 Samuel 13:11</a>), and the seductive invitation in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>: &#8220;Come, let us take our fill of love&#8221; (v. 18). Joseph&#8217;s refusal and flight fulfill New Testament counsel: &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to make sport of me</b><p>The phrase means to mock or humiliate. She twists Joseph&#8217;s integrity into an attempt at violation, as Delilah&#8217;s captors later forced blinded Samson &#8220;to entertain them&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a>). The same verb appears when Isaac was &#8220;caressing Rebekah&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>), showing how an innocent act can be distorted into scandal. Her accusation aims to incite Potiphar&#8217;s anger to the highest degree, ensuring Joseph&#8217;s punishment without investigation, paralleling the nails hammered by deceitful witnesses against Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/39-17.htm">Genesis 39:17</a> captures a calculated, repeated lie rooted in envy and lust. Potiphar&#8217;s wife manipulates language&#8212;highlighting Joseph&#8217;s foreignness, shifting blame, claiming victimhood, and presenting a noble servant as a predator. The verse exposes the destructive power of false testimony and prejudice while setting the stage for God&#8217;s larger plan: Joseph&#8217;s unjust suffering will steer him toward the very position that preserves countless lives (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Though the righteous may be slandered, the Lord&#8217;s sovereignty and justice prevail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/39-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then she told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
