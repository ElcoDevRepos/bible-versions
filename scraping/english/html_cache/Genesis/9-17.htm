Noah, a righteous man in his generation, found favor in God's eyes (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8-9</a>). This communication follows the flood narrative, where Noah and his family were preserved through the ark, symbolizing salvation and divine protection.<p><b>This is the sign of the covenant</b><br>The term "sign" refers to a visible, tangible reminder of God's promise. In biblical context, signs often serve as confirmations of divine covenants, such as circumcision with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>) and the Sabbath with Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). The rainbow, as the sign here, represents God's mercy and faithfulness, assuring humanity that He will never again destroy the earth with a flood.<p><b>that I have established</b><br>The use of "established" indicates a firm, unbreakable commitment from God. This covenant is unilateral, meaning it is initiated and guaranteed by God alone, without conditions placed upon humanity. It reflects God's sovereign grace and His desire to maintain a relationship with His creation despite human sinfulness.<p><b>between Me and every creature on the earth</b><br>This phrase highlights the universal scope of the covenant. Unlike later covenants that are specific to Israel, this promise extends to all living creatures, emphasizing God's care for the entire creation. It underscores the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all life and His ongoing commitment to the world He made. This covenant is a precursor to the ultimate reconciliation of creation through Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-21</a>, where creation awaits liberation from corruption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator and Sustainer of the universe, who establishes a covenant with Noah and all living creatures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A divine promise made by God, signified by the rainbow, ensuring that He will never again destroy all life with a flood.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_living_things.htm">All Living Things</a></b><br>Refers to every creature on earth, highlighting the universal scope of God's promise.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The physical realm where God's covenant is established, emphasizing His sovereignty over creation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The covenant with Noah is a testament to God's unwavering faithfulness and mercy.

7:1) and directions after it (<a href="/genesis/8-15.htm">Genesis 8:15-17</a>), He now speaks assurance.<p>- The same voice that judged the world with water now comforts it with promise (compare <a href="/psalms/29-10.htm">Psalm 29:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the sign</b><p>- God points to something visible and objective&#8212;the rainbow previously introduced in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>.<p>- Throughout Scripture, God loves to attach physical signs to spiritual realities:<p>&#8226;

it is God-given evidence meant to reinforce faith whenever the eye sees what the ear has heard.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the covenant</b><p>- A covenant is a solemn, binding agreement initiated by God (<a href="/genesis/6-18.htm">Genesis 6:18</a>; 9:11).<p>- Unlike human contracts, this divine covenant rests on God&#8217;s character alone (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>).<p>- Later covenants&#8212;Abrahamic (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>), Mosaic (<a href="/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>), Davidic (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), and the New Covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>;

<a href="/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>).<p>- This phrase highlights divine involvement; no intermediary or angelic delegate administers the pledge&#8212;God does.<p>- Similar intimacy echoes in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, &#8220;He will dwell with them, and they will be His people.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and every creature on the earth</b><p>- The reach is universal&#8212;people and animals alike (<a href="/genesis/9-10.htm">Genesis 9:10</a>).<p>- God cares for all He has made;

He personally informs Noah that the colorful arch is not random beauty but the enduring, visible proof of His unbreakable covenant never again to destroy all life by flood. The verse invites every observer&#8212;then and now&#8212;to look up after the rain, remember God&#8217;s faithfulness, and rest in a promise established by the Creator and extended to every living creature on the planet.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God said unto Noah, This</span> <span class="cmt_word">is the token of the covenant.</span> Murphy thinks that God here directed the patriarch's attention to an actual rainbow; it seems more natural to conclude that from the beginning of the interview (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) the ark, altar, and worshippers were encircled by its variegated arch. Kalisch compares with the rainbow the other signs which God subsequently appended to his covenants; as, e.g., circumcision (<a href="/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11</a>), the passover (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>), the sabbath (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 31:13). The Noachic covenant being universal, the sign was also universal - "<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (I1, 11:27), a sign to men of many tongues. The later covenants being limited to Israel, their signs were local and provisional, and have now been supplanted by the higher symbolism of the Christian Church, viz., baptism, the Lord's Supper, and the Christian sabbath. <span class="cmt_word">Which I have established</span>. The different verbs used in this passage in connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> may be here brought together. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (ver. 12) representing the covenant as a gift of Divine grace. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;</span> (Hiph.; vers. 9, 11, 17) exhibiting the covenant as something which God has both caused to stand and raised up when fallen. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (ver. 15) depicting the covenant as always present to the Divine mind.
