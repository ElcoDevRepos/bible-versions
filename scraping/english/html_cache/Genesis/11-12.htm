This genealogy is significant as it traces the lineage from Noah to Abraham, establishing the Semitic line. The age of 35 is noteworthy as it reflects the post-flood decrease in human lifespan, which is a theme seen throughout the genealogies in Genesis. This decrease in lifespan is often interpreted as a result of the changing conditions on Earth after the flood.<p><b>he became the father of Shelah</b><br>Shelah is an important figure in the genealogical line leading to Abraham, and subsequently to the nation of Israel. The name Shelah means "request" or "petition," which may reflect cultural or familial expectations at the time. This lineage is also mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Luke (<a href="/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35-36</a>), highlighting its significance in the messianic line. The continuity of this line emphasizes God's faithfulness in preserving the lineage through which He would fulfill His promises to Abraham and ultimately bring about redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arphaxad.htm">Arphaxad</a></b><br>A descendant of Noah, specifically the son of Shem.
