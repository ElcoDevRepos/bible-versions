This location is significant in biblical history as a place of covenant and witness. Mizpah is mentioned in various contexts throughout the Old Testament, often as a site of gathering or judgment (<a href="/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-6</a>). The naming of Mizpah here signifies a boundary and a place of divine oversight, emphasizing the solemnity of the agreement between Jacob and Laban.<p><b>because Laban said</b><br>Laban, Jacob's father-in-law, is a key figure in the narrative of Jacob's life. His statement here is part of a larger dialogue where he and Jacob establish a covenant. Laban's words reflect his concern for the future and the need for a divine witness to their agreement. This reflects the cultural practice of invoking God as a witness in covenants, which was common in ancient Near Eastern treaties.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD keep watch between you and me</b><br>The invocation of the LORD (Yahweh) as a divine overseer highlights the seriousness of the covenant. In the ancient world, invoking a deity in agreements was a way to ensure accountability and truthfulness. The phrase suggests a mutual trust in God's omnipresence and justice, even when human eyes cannot see. This reflects the biblical theme of God's watchfulness and care over His people (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p><b>when we are absent from each other.</b><br>The physical separation between Jacob and Laban necessitated a divine witness to their covenant. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's presence transcending physical boundaries. The idea of God watching over His people, even in their absence from one another, is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, where Jesus promises to be with His followers always. This phrase underscores the enduring nature of divine oversight and the importance of faithfulness in relationships, even when apart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.
