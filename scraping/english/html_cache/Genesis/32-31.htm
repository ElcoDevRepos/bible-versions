In biblical narratives, the rising sun can represent God's presence and blessing. The timing of the sunrise here may indicate a transition from darkness to light, both literally and metaphorically, as Jacob moves forward after his encounter with God.<p><b>as he passed by Penuel</b><br>Penuel, also known as Peniel, means "face of God" in Hebrew. This location is significant because it is where Jacob wrestled with God and saw Him face to face, yet his life was spared. The naming of this place underscores the importance of divine encounters and the transformation that occurs through them. Penuel is situated east of the Jordan River, and its mention here connects to other biblical events where God reveals Himself to His people.<p><b>and he was limping because of his hip</b><br>Jacob's limp serves as a physical reminder of his encounter with God. It symbolizes human weakness and the transformative power of divine intervention. The limp is a mark of both struggle and blessing, as Jacob's name was changed to Israel, meaning "he struggles with God." This physical ailment also prefigures the concept of strength through weakness, a theme echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>, where Paul speaks of God's power being made perfect in weakness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is returning to his homeland after years of living with his uncle Laban.
