The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week (Genesis 1). This waiting period could signify a final opportunity for repentance or a time of divine patience before judgment. It parallels the seven days of creation, suggesting a new beginning or re-creation through the flood.<p><b>the floodwaters came</b><br>The floodwaters represent God's judgment on a corrupt world, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-7</a>. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, marking a transition from the antediluvian world to a new era. The flood narrative is echoed in other ancient Near Eastern texts, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh, but the biblical account emphasizes moral and theological themes. The floodwaters can also be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing cleansing and renewal, as referenced in <a href="/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20-21</a>.<p><b>upon the earth</b><br>The earth here refers to the entire inhabited world, emphasizing the universality of the flood's impact. This global judgment underscores the seriousness of sin and the extent of God's authority over creation. The flood narrative sets the stage for God's covenant with Noah, which reaffirms His commitment to humanity and the earth (<a href="/genesis/9-11.htm">Genesis 9:11-17</a>). The phrase also foreshadows future judgments and the ultimate renewal of creation, as seen in prophetic literature like <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life through the flood.
