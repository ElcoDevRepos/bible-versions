This time allowed for the development of relationships and the testing of Isaac's faith. The duration suggests a significant period of adaptation and potential influence on the surrounding culture, as well as the testing of God's promises to Isaac.<p><b>Abimelech king of the Philistines</b><br>Abimelech is a title used for Philistine rulers, similar to "Pharaoh" in Egypt. This Abimelech may not be the same as the one who interacted with Abraham, suggesting a dynastic title. The Philistines were a significant presence in the region, often in conflict with the Israelites, and their interactions with the patriarchs set the stage for future tensions.<p><b>looked down from the window</b><br>The act of looking down from a window implies a position of authority and oversight. Windows in ancient times were often small openings, suggesting that Abimelech's observation was either accidental or divinely orchestrated. This moment of observation leads to a revelation of truth, reminiscent of other biblical instances where hidden truths are uncovered.<p><b>and was surprised to see</b><br>Abimelech's surprise indicates that Isaac's true relationship with Rebekah had been concealed. This moment of revelation is pivotal, as it uncovers deception and prompts a confrontation. The element of surprise underscores the human tendency to hide truth and the divine orchestration in revealing it.<p><b>Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah</b><br>The act of caressing signifies intimacy and affection, confirming Rebekah's status as Isaac's wife. This public display of affection was culturally significant, as it contradicted Isaac's earlier claim that Rebekah was his sister. This mirrors Abraham's similar deception with Sarah, highlighting a recurring theme of fear and protection within the patriarchal narratives. The revelation of their true relationship serves as a turning point, leading to a covenant of peace and protection with Abimelech.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.
