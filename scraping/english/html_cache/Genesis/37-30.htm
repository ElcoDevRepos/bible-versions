Reuben, the eldest son of Jacob, had initially planned to rescue Joseph and return him to their father. His return signifies a moment of leadership and responsibility, as the eldest son traditionally held a position of authority and accountability within the family structure. This moment also highlights the dynamics and tensions among the brothers, as Reuben's absence allowed the others to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites.<p><b>and said, &#8220;The boy is gone!</b><br>Reuben's exclamation reveals his shock and distress upon finding the pit empty. The term "the boy" underscores Joseph's youth and vulnerability, emphasizing the gravity of the situation. This moment is pivotal, as it marks the beginning of Joseph's journey to Egypt, which is central to the unfolding narrative of God's providence and the eventual preservation of the Israelites. The phrase also foreshadows the brothers' deception of their father, Jacob, and the ensuing family turmoil.<p><b>What am I going to do?&#8221;</b><br>Reuben's question reflects his personal turmoil and fear of the consequences. As the eldest, he would bear the brunt of their father's grief and anger. This moment of desperation can be seen as a precursor to the later guilt and remorse the brothers experience, particularly when they face Joseph in Egypt. Reuben's question also highlights the theme of human responsibility and the moral dilemmas faced by individuals, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. This phrase connects to the broader narrative of redemption and forgiveness, as seen in Joseph's eventual reconciliation with his brothers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The eldest son of Jacob, who had intended to rescue Joseph from the pit and return him to their father.
