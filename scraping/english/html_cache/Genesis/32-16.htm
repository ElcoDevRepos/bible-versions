This act of delegation reflects his wealth and status, as he has numerous servants to manage his possessions. In biblical times, servants often played crucial roles in managing household affairs, similar to Abraham's servant Eliezer. This delegation also shows Jacob's strategic planning, as he uses his resources to appease Esau.<p><b>in separate herds</b><br>Jacob divides the animals into separate groups, a strategic move to create a buffer and potentially soften Esau's heart. This division could symbolize the careful planning and wisdom often attributed to Jacob. It also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where large herds were managed in smaller groups for better control and protection.<p><b>and told them, &#8220;Go on ahead of me</b><br>Jacob instructs his servants to lead the herds ahead, indicating his cautious approach to meeting Esau. This action demonstrates his humility and desire for reconciliation, as he sends gifts before him to pacify his brother. It echoes the biblical principle of peacemaking, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>, where a gift given in secret can pacify anger.<p><b>and keep some distance between the herds.&#8221;</b><br>By instructing his servants to maintain distance between the herds, Jacob aims to create a prolonged and impactful presentation of his wealth and goodwill. This tactic could serve to impress Esau and mitigate any lingering hostility. The spacing of the herds also reflects a strategic approach to conflict resolution, emphasizing patience and foresight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jacob is preparing to meet his brother Esau after many years.

The text underscores: &#8220;He entrusted them to his servants.&#8221; By doing so, Jacob models wise stewardship&#8212;he owns the flocks, yet assigns responsibility to faithful helpers (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a> where Abraham does the same; <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14&#8211;15</a> where a master entrusts talents to servants). Delegation protects the assets God has provided and frees Jacob to concentrate on the imminent meeting with Esau. It also reflects humility; rather than clutching everything himself, he relies on dependable workers whom the Lord has put under his care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in separate herds</b><p>The livestock are deliberately grouped. This tactic is both strategic and generous:<p>&#8226; Spaced&#8208;out gifts magnify the size of the present (<a href="/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>, &#8220;I will appease him with the gift that is going before me&#8221;).<p>&#8226; If one herd is seized, others may survive (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, &#8220;The prudent see danger and take cover&#8221;).<p>&#8226; By dividing assets, Jacob follows a pattern of diversification echoed later in <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>, &#8220;Divide your portions to seven, yes, to eight.&#8221;<p>Literal organization of the herds displays prudence and foresight&#8212;qualities already evident when Jacob increased his flocks under Laban (<a href="/genesis/30-43.htm">Genesis 30:43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go on ahead of me</b><p>Jacob directs, &#8220;Go on ahead of me.&#8221; The gifts must precede him, softening Esau&#8217;s heart before personal contact.

Orderly separation resembles <a href="/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a>, where distance around the Ark preserves reverence and clarity. It also echoes <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>, &#8220;Let all things be done decently and in order.&#8221; The gap allows each servant to declare Jacob&#8217;s message afresh, multiplying the impact of the reconciliation gesture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/32-16.htm">Genesis 32:16</a> presents Jacob&#8217;s intentional, orderly plan to appease Esau: he entrusts valuable livestock to servants, divides them into successive herds, sends them ahead, and spaces them for maximum effect. Every detail shows practical wisdom, humility, and faith in God&#8217;s providence while honoring the literal narrative.
