It marks a turning point in his life, as he prepares to leave Laban's household. This decision follows a divine command (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>) and reflects Jacob's obedience to God's direction. It also signifies a moment of faith, as Jacob trusts in God's promise to be with him.<p><b>and put his children and his wives on camels,</b><br>The use of camels suggests wealth and status, as camels were valuable animals in ancient times, often associated with trade and long journeys. This detail highlights Jacob's prosperity despite Laban's attempts to cheat him. The mention of "children and wives" underscores the importance of family in Jacob's journey, reflecting the patriarchal emphasis on lineage and covenant promises. The act of placing them on camels indicates preparation for a long and arduous journey back to Canaan, the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. This journey can be seen as a type of the Exodus, where God's people are led out of bondage into the Promised Land, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is the central figure in this passage.
