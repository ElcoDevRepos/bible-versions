It shows that Abraham continued to fulfill God's command to be fruitful and multiply. The act of taking another wife was culturally acceptable in the ancient Near East, where polygamy was common, especially for patriarchs and leaders. This decision also reflects Abraham's ongoing role in God's covenantal plan, as he continued to father nations.<p><b>named Keturah,</b><br>Keturah's name is mentioned here for the first time, and she is identified as Abraham's wife. The name Keturah means "incense" or "fragrance," which may symbolize her role in bringing new life and continuation of Abraham's lineage. Keturah's children with Abraham are listed later in the chapter, and they are significant in the broader narrative of the descendants of Abraham. Her offspring would become tribes that interacted with Israel throughout history. This union further fulfills God's promise to Abraham that he would be the father of many nations, as Keturah's descendants are part of the broader Abrahamic lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

The sole objection is his own statement, in <a href="/genesis/17-17.htm" title="Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born to him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?">Genesis 17:17</a>, that it was a thing beyond nature for a man a hundred years old to have a son; how much more improbable, then, must it have become after forty more years had passed by! The argument on the other side, which would infer that the marriage took place in Sarah's lifetime, from the fact that the birth of grandchildren is mentioned in <a href="/context/genesis/25-3.htm" title="And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.">Genesis 25:3-4</a>, has little weight, as their names might have been subsequently added to bring down the genealogy to a later date.<p>Jewish commentators cut the knot by identifying Keturah with Hagar, who in the meanwhile had, as they say, set an example of matronly virtue in the manner in which she had devoted herself to the bringing up of Ishmael. But in <a href="/genesis/25-6.htm" title="But to the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.">Genesis 25:6</a> there is an evident allusion to both Hagar and Keturah in the mention of Abraham's "concubines" in the plural; and in <a href="/1_chronicles/1-32.htm" title="Now the sons of Keturah, Abraham's concubine: she bore Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
