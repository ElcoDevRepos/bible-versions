The animals' coming to Noah signifies God's sovereignty and control over nature, ensuring the preservation of each species. This event parallels the later gathering of animals in <a href="/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, where harmony in creation is restored. The ark, a symbol of salvation, prefigures Christ as the refuge for humanity from judgment.<p><b>two by two</b><br>The phrase "two by two" emphasizes the orderly and purposeful nature of God's plan for preservation. It ensures the continuation of each species after the flood. This methodical approach reflects God's wisdom and care in creation, similar to the pairs of clean and unclean animals later described in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>. The pairing also symbolizes the importance of companionship and the balance of creation.<p><b>male and female</b><br>The mention of "male and female" underscores the importance of gender roles in the continuation of life. This mirrors the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, where God created humans in His image, male and female. The distinction of genders is crucial for reproduction and the fulfillment of God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). It also reflects the complementary nature of male and female in God's design.<p><b>as God had commanded Noah</b><br>This phrase highlights Noah's obedience to God's instructions, a recurring theme in the narrative of the flood. Noah's faithfulness is commended in <a href="/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>, where he is listed among the heroes of faith. His adherence to God's command serves as a model of righteousness and trust in divine guidance. This obedience prefigures Christ's submission to the Father's will, as seen in <a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, where Jesus states His purpose to do the will of the One who sent Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.
