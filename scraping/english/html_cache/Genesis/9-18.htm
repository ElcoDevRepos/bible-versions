Shem, Ham, and Japheth are often seen as the ancestors of different ethnic and linguistic groups. Shem is traditionally associated with the Semitic peoples, including the Israelites, Arabs, and others in the Middle East. Ham is linked to African and some Middle Eastern populations, while Japheth is connected to the Indo-European peoples. The mention of these sons highlights the new beginning for humanity after the flood, emphasizing the continuity of God's plan for mankind. The ark's landing on Mount Ararat symbolizes a new covenant and a fresh start for humanity, echoing themes of salvation and redemption.<p><b>And Ham was the father of Canaan.</b><br>This phrase introduces Canaan, who becomes a significant figure in biblical history. Canaan is the ancestor of the Canaanites, who inhabited the land that God later promised to Abraham and his descendants. This mention foreshadows the future conflict between the Israelites and the Canaanites, as well as the eventual conquest of Canaan by the Israelites under Joshua. The reference to Ham as Canaan's father also sets the stage for the subsequent narrative involving Noah's curse on Canaan, which has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. This curse is often seen as a prophetic declaration of the future subjugation of the Canaanites. Theologically, this phrase underscores the theme of generational consequences and the unfolding of God's sovereign plan through human history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>The righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.

No brother sheds a brother's blood, but in the next generation sin breaks forth afresh, and the human family is disunited thereby, the descendants of Canaan taking the place of the Cainites--without indeed, their striking gifts, but nevertheless as a race foremost in trade and commerce.

The present section, extending to ver. 27, is usually assigned to the Jehovistic author (Tuch,Bleek, Kalisch, Colenso, Kuenen), though by Davidson it is ascribed to a so-called redactor, with the exception of the present clause, which is recognized as the Jehovist's contribution to the story. The ground of this apportionment is the introduction of the name Jehovah in ver. 26 (q.v.), and certain traces throughout the paragraph of the style of writing supposed to be peculiar to the supplementer. <span class="cmt_word">And Ham is the father of Canaan</span>. <span class="accented">Kena'an</span>, the depressed or low one; either the Lowlander or inhabitant of a tow coast country, as opposed to the loftier regions (Aram); from kana , to be low, depressed, in situation, as of land (Gesenius); or more probably the servile one in spirit (Furst, Murphy, Keil, Lange). The reason for the insertion of this notice here, and of the similar one in ver. 22, was obviously to draw attention to the circumstance, not "that the origin of Israel's ascendancy and of Canaan's degradation dates so far back as the family of the second founder of the human race," as if the writer's standpoint were long subsequent to the conquest (Kalisch), but that, "as Israel was now going to possess the land of Canaan, they might know that now was the time when the curse of Canaan and his posterity should take place" (Wilier). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/9-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Noah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1431;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5146.htm">Strong's 5146: </a> </span><span class="str2">Noah -- 'rest', patriarch who survived the flood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who came out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
