In biblical context, "eyes being opened" often symbolizes gaining knowledge or insight. This moment marks the transition from innocence to the awareness of sin. It parallels other scriptural instances where enlightenment leads to a deeper understanding of one's spiritual state, such as in <a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>, where the disciples' eyes were opened to recognize Jesus.<p><b>and they knew that they were naked</b><br>The realization of their nakedness represents a newfound consciousness of vulnerability and shame. Prior to this, Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed (<a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>), indicating a state of purity and innocence. The awareness of their nakedness symbolizes the loss of innocence and the entrance of sin into human experience. This moment foreshadows the need for spiritual covering and redemption, which is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who covers our sins.<p><b>so they sewed together fig leaves</b><br>The act of sewing fig leaves together is the first recorded attempt by humans to cover their own sin and shame. Fig leaves, common in the region, were likely chosen for their size and availability. This action represents human efforts to deal with sin through self-made solutions, which are inadequate compared to God's provision. This foreshadows the futility of works-based righteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, where human righteousness is described as "filthy rags."<p><b>and made coverings for themselves</b><br>The coverings symbolize humanity's attempt to hide from God and each other, reflecting a broken relationship with both. This act of self-covering contrasts with God's later provision of garments made from animal skins (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>), which required a sacrifice, pointing to the necessity of atonement through blood. This prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose righteousness covers believers, as described in <a href="/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>, where believers are urged to "clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adam_and_eve.htm">Adam and Eve</a></b><br>The first humans created by God, living in the Garden of Eden.

But manifestly her deed was not without his cognisance and approval, and he had shared, in his own way, her ambition of attaining to the God like. But how miserably was this proud desire dis appointed! Their increased knowledge brought only shame. Their minds were awakened and enlarged, but the price they paid for it was their innocence and peace.<p><span class= "bld">They sewed fig leaves together.</span>--There is no reason for supposing that the leaves were those of the pisang (<span class= "ital">Musa paradisiaca</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>which grow ten feet long. Everywhere else the word signifies the common fig-tree (<span class= "ital">Ficus carica</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>one of the earliest plants subjected to man's use. More remarkable is the word <span class= "ital">sewed. </span>The Syriac translator felt the difficulty of supposing Eve acquainted with the art of needlework, and renders it, "they stuck leaves together." But the word certainly implies something more elaborate than this. Probably some time elapsed between their sin and its punishment; and thus there was not merely that first hasty covering of themselves which has made commentators look about for a leaf large enough to encircle their bodies, but respite sufficient to allow of something more careful and ingenious; and Eve may have used her first advance in intellect for the adornment of her person. During this delay they would have time for reflection, and begin to understand the nature of the change that had taken place in their condition.<p><span class= "bld">Aprons.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">girdles.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the eyes of them both were opened</span>.
