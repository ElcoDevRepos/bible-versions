Lot's departure signifies a separation that allows Abram to fully step into the promises God has for him. This separation can be seen as a necessary step for Abram to fulfill his divine calling. The division of land between Abram and Lot (<a href="/genesis/13-9.htm">Genesis 13:9-11</a>) reflects the cultural practices of the time, where family members would part ways to avoid conflict over resources. This moment also highlights the importance of obedience and faith in God's plan, as Abram remains in the land God promised him.<p><b>the LORD said to Abram</b><br>The direct communication from the LORD to Abram underscores the personal relationship between God and Abram. This divine interaction is a recurring theme in Abram's life, emphasizing his role as a patriarch and a man of faith. God's speaking to Abram after Lot's departure suggests that God&#8217;s promises and guidance are often revealed after acts of obedience and faith. This moment is pivotal, as it reaffirms God's covenant with Abram, which is foundational to the narrative of the Israelites and the unfolding of biblical history.<p><b>Now lift up your eyes from the place where you are</b><br>This command to "lift up your eyes" is both literal and symbolic. Geographically, Abram is in Canaan, a land that holds significant promise for his descendants. Spiritually, this act of looking up signifies a call to vision and faith, encouraging Abram to see beyond his current circumstances. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and the vastness of His promises. This phrase invites believers to trust in God's provision and to look beyond immediate challenges to the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>and look to the north and south and east and west</b><br>This comprehensive view symbolizes the extent of the land that God is promising to Abram and his descendants. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of surveying land, which was a sign of ownership and blessing. The four directions represent completeness and universality, indicating that God's promise to Abram is vast and all-encompassing. This promise is later reiterated in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where God specifies the boundaries of the land. The land promise to Abram is a precursor to the establishment of Israel and is a key element in biblical prophecy, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in the coming of Christ and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is the recipient of God's promise.

From his present location, Abram is to envision a God-given inheritance that spans every direction, underscoring the completeness and certainty of the Lord&#8217;s promise&#8212;a lesson that still calls believers to trust God&#8217;s word over visible circumstances.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The Lord said unto Abram.</span>--The departure of Lot was certainly a great grief to Abram; for he lost thereby the companionship of the relative who had shared his abandonment of his country, and whom, probably, in his childless state, he had regarded as his heir. Jehovah, therefore, consoles him by a more definite promise of the possession of the whole land of which he had so generously given Lot the choice, and by the assurance that his own seed should be numerous as the dust of the earth. We may also feel sure that as Lot was deteriorating, so Abram was drawing nearer to God, and walking more closely with Him; and hence the fuller assurance of the Divine blessing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said</span> - speaking probably with an articulate voice; the third occasion on which the patriarch was directly addressed by God.
