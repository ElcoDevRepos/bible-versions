Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah, had deceived Jacob multiple times, changing his wages and exploiting his labor (<a href="/genesis/31-7.htm">Genesis 31:7</a>). The wealth transfer is seen as God's intervention to rectify the injustices Jacob faced. This echoes the biblical principle that God is a defender of the oppressed (<a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a>). The mention of "our children" highlights the importance of inheritance and legacy in ancient Near Eastern culture, where family wealth was crucial for survival and social standing. This also foreshadows the future prosperity of Jacob's descendants, the Israelites, as promised in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>So do whatever God has told you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's guidance. Rachel and Leah's support for Jacob's decision to leave Laban's household is rooted in their recognition of God's will. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where faith and obedience to God lead to blessing and fulfillment of His promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The phrase also highlights the role of divine revelation in decision-making, as God had appeared to Jacob in a dream, instructing him to return to his homeland (<a href="/genesis/31-3.htm">Genesis 31:3</a>). This obedience is a type of Christ, who perfectly followed the Father's will (<a href="/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>), serving as a model for believers to trust and act upon God's direction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who has been working for Laban, his father-in-law, and is now preparing to leave with his family and possessions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rachel_and_leah.htm">Rachel and Leah</a></b><br>The wives of Jacob, daughters of Laban, who express their support for Jacob's decision to leave Laban's household.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>The father of Rachel and Leah, who has been deceitful and manipulative in his dealings with Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who has blessed Jacob and instructed him to return to his homeland.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/paddan-aram.htm">Paddan-aram</a></b><br>The region where Jacob has been living and working for Laban, and from which he is preparing to depart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice_and_provision.htm">Divine Justice and Provision</a></b><br>God ensures that justice is served and provides for His people, even when others act deceitfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_unity_in_god's_plan.htm">Family Unity in God's Plan</a></b><br>Rachel and Leah's agreement with Jacob highlights the importance of family unity in following God's direction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Jacob's patience and trust in God's timing resulted in blessings and protection, encouraging believers to wait on the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Jacob's willingness to follow God's command, despite potential risks, serves as a model of faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_wealth.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Wealth</a></b><br>The transfer of wealth from Laban to Jacob's family illustrates God's control over material resources and His ability to provide for His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_31_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_31_16_God_s_care_for_Jacob_s_kin.htm">How does Genesis 31:16 reflect God's provision and protection for Jacob's family?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_31_16_reveal.htm">What does "all the wealth" in Genesis 31:16 reveal about God's blessings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_promises_like_Rachel_Leah.htm">How can we trust God's promises like Rachel and Leah in Genesis 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_31_16_link_to_Abraham_s_covenant.htm">What scriptural connections exist between Genesis 31:16 and God's covenant with Abraham?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Respond_to_God_s_provision_today.htm">How should believers today respond to God's provision as seen in Genesis 31:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_31_16_and_ancient_inheritance_norms.htm">How does Genesis 31:16 reflect the cultural norms of inheritance in ancient times?
