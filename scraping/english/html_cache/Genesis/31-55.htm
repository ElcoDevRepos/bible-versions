In biblical narratives, early morning often signifies a new beginning or a decisive action (e.g., <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, when Abraham sets out to sacrifice Isaac). It suggests Laban's acceptance of the situation and his readiness to move forward.<p><b>Laban got up</b><br>Laban's rising signifies his active role in the events. Throughout Genesis, Laban is portrayed as a shrewd and sometimes manipulative character (Genesis 29-31). His getting up here may symbolize a shift from confrontation to acceptance.<p><b>and kissed his grandchildren and daughters</b><br>Kissing in ancient Near Eastern culture was a common expression of affection and farewell (<a href="/genesis/27-26.htm">Genesis 27:26-27</a>). Laban's act of kissing his family members shows a personal and emotional connection, despite previous tensions with Jacob. It reflects a moment of familial reconciliation and peace.<p><b>and blessed them</b><br>Blessings in the patriarchal narratives are significant, often conveying a transfer of favor and divine promise (<a href="/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27-29</a>). Laban's blessing, though not as prominent as those given by the patriarchs, still carries weight as a gesture of goodwill and hope for prosperity and protection.<p><b>Then he left to return home</b><br>Laban's departure marks the end of his direct involvement in Jacob's life. This return home signifies a return to his own affairs and the conclusion of his pursuit of Jacob. It also highlights the theme of separation and the fulfillment of God's promise to Jacob to return to his homeland (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>The father of Leah and Rachel, and the father-in-law of Jacob.

Scripture often associates morning with fresh starts&#8212;think of Abraham rising early to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) or Israel gathering manna at dawn (<a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>). Here the new morning signals a decisive, peaceful transition after long tension, echoing <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, &#8220;weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Laban got up</b><p>&#8226; His rising shows personal responsibility: he himself carries out the farewell rather than delegating it. Like Jethro personally visiting Moses (<a href="/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5-7</a>), Laban&#8217;s presence affirms the sincerity of the covenant and models family leadership. The text&#8217;s straightforward statement reminds us that Scripture records real events involving real people&#8212;Laban literally stood, ready to act on yesterday&#8217;s words.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kissed his grandchildren and daughters</b><p>&#8226; Physical affection seals family bonds. Jacob&#8217;s children, born amid strife, now receive tender acknowledgment from their maternal grandfather. Comparable moments appear when Joseph kisses his brothers (<a href="/genesis/45-15.htm">Genesis 45:15</a>) and when Paul embraces the Ephesian elders (<a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37</a>). The gesture testifies that despite past deception (<a href="/genesis/29-20.htm">Genesis 29:20-27</a>; 31:7), covenant grace can soften hearts, fulfilling <a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>: &#8220;Grandchildren are the crown of the aged.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And blessed them</b><p>&#8226; A spoken blessing conveys more than emotion; it invokes God&#8217;s favor. Laban, though previously invoking his household gods (<a href="/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>), now verbalizes goodwill in the wake of Jacob&#8217;s altar and sacrifice (31:54). This echoes Isaac&#8217;s blessing over Jacob (27:27-29) and Aaron&#8217;s priestly benediction (<a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>). Scripture treats blessings as effectual words aligned with God&#8217;s purposes; here they mark a formal, peaceful conclusion to family conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he left to return home</b><p>&#8226; Laban&#8217;s departure fulfills the covenant&#8217;s boundary clause: each party stays on his side of the pillar-witness (<a href="/genesis/31-51.htm">Genesis 31:51-52</a>). By obeying it immediately, Laban demonstrates acceptance of God&#8217;s oversight of the agreement, paralleling Abraham and Lot&#8217;s peaceful separation (<a href="/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8-12</a>). The text literally closes his narrative arc, paving the way for Jacob to continue toward the land promised to his fathers (31:3; 32:1).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/31-55.htm">Genesis 31:55</a> records a literal, historical farewell that transforms hostility into harmony. At dawn, Laban rises, embraces his family, pronounces blessing, and departs, honoring the covenant he and Jacob made under God&#8217;s watch. The verse illustrates that when God intervenes, strained relationships can end in peace, affection, and obedience, setting the stage for His ongoing covenant plan through Jacob&#8217;s line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters</span>, - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.
