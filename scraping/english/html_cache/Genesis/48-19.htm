His refusal is significant as it demonstrates his authority and the divine insight he possesses. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical instances where the expected order is overturned, such as when Jacob himself received the blessing over his elder brother Esau (Genesis 27). It highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing whom He wills, regardless of human customs or expectations.<p><b>&#8220;I know, my son, I know!&#8221; he said.</b><br>Jacob's response to Joseph is both tender and firm, indicating his awareness and certainty of God's plan. The repetition of "I know" emphasizes his confidence in the divine revelation he has received. This assurance is similar to other patriarchal blessings where the speaker is guided by divine insight, such as Isaac's blessing over Jacob and Esau.<p><b>&#8220;He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great;</b><br>This part of the blessing acknowledges that Manasseh, Joseph's firstborn, will also have a significant future. The promise that he will become a "people" and "great" reflects the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised Abraham that his descendants would be numerous and blessed (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). It underscores the idea that God's blessings are abundant and not limited to one individual or line.<p><b>nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he,</b><br>Ephraim, the younger brother, is prophesied to surpass Manasseh in prominence. This reversal of the birthright is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the stories of Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, and later David over his older brothers. It points to the concept that God's ways are not bound by human traditions and that He often chooses the unlikely to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.&#8221;</b><br>Ephraim's descendants are foretold to become a "multitude of nations," indicating a vast and influential lineage. This prophecy is fulfilled as Ephraim becomes one of the dominant tribes in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The phrase also echoes the promise to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>). In a broader sense, it foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, as seen in the New Testament, where the gospel extends beyond Israel to all nations (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch who is blessing his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh, in this passage.

Joseph tries to correct him, but the patriarch &#8220;refused,&#8221; showing firm resolve. Similar younger-over-older choices appear with Isaac over Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18-21</a>), Jacob over Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a>), and later David over his brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>). The pattern underlines that God&#8217;s purposes outrank human custom of primogeniture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I know, my son, I know!</b><p>Jacob lovingly but confidently answers Joseph. Twice saying &#8220;I know&#8221; stresses that this is no mistake; he is acting by spiritual insight (<a href="/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a>). God had revealed His will to Jacob throughout his life (<a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2-4</a>), and the aged patriarch remains sensitive to that guidance. <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He too shall become a people</b><p>&#8220; He&#8221; refers to Manasseh.

The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s sovereign freedom to choose, His faithfulness to bless both sons, and His unfolding plan to multiply His people and extend blessing far beyond the immediate family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/48.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">His younger brother shall be greater.</span>--In the final numbering of the tribes on the plains of Moab, the tribe of Manasseh had 52,700 souls, and that of Ephraim only 32,500 (<a href="/numbers/26-34.htm" title="These are the families of Manasseh, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and two thousand and seven hundred.">Numbers 26:34</a>; <a href="/numbers/26-37.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred. These are the sons of Joseph after their families.">Numbers 26:37</a>). It was the division of the tribe of Manasseh into two portions which made it politically insignificant, while Ephraim obtained a commanding position in the land of Canaan; and as Joshua was an Ephraimite, it naturally held the rank of foremost tribe during his days, and claimed it always afterwards. For Joshua, after the conquest of Canaan, must have held a position similar to that of General Washington after the independence of the United States had been secured, and all Israel would regard him as their ruler and chief. The influence also of the tribe would be strengthened by the ark being placed in one of its towns.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/48.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and over against that</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, the strongly adversative particle, signifying that which stands in front of, or opposite to, another thing) <span class="cmt_word">his younger brother shall be greater than he</span> (cf. <a href="/numbers/1-33.htm">Numbers 1:33</a> with Numbers 1:35; 2:19 with Numbers 2:21), <span class="cmt_word">and his seed shall become a multitude of nations</span> - literally, <span class="accented">shall be a fullness of nations</span>. In the time of Moses this prediction began to realize itself. In the first census which took place in the wilderness the tribe of Ephraim had 40,500 men, while that of Manasseh could only reckon 32,200; in the second the numbers received a temporary alteration, Ephraim counting only 32,500, and Manasseh 52,700; but after the conquest the ascendancy of Ephraim wag restored, so that she easily assumed the lead among the ten northern tribes, and acquired a name and an influence only second to that of Judah (cf. <a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>;
