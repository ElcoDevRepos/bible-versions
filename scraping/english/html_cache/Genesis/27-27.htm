It signifies trust and closeness, which is ironic given the deception at play. The kiss is reminiscent of other biblical instances where a kiss is used in both genuine and deceitful contexts, such as Judas' kiss to Jesus in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>).<p><b>When Isaac smelled his clothing,</b><br>The sense of smell plays a crucial role here, as Isaac relies on it due to his failing eyesight. The clothing, belonging to Esau, is part of the deception orchestrated by Rebekah and Jacob. This moment underscores the importance of sensory perception in the absence of sight, and it highlights the vulnerability of Isaac, who is deceived by the external appearance rather than the internal truth.<p><b>he blessed him and said:</b><br>The blessing is a significant act, carrying the weight of inheritance and divine favor. In the patriarchal society, a father's blessing was irrevocable and held prophetic significance. This blessing, intended for Esau, is mistakenly given to Jacob, fulfilling God's earlier prophecy to Rebekah that "the older will serve the younger" (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Ah, the smell of my son</b><br>Isaac's recognition of the smell as belonging to his son reflects the pastoral and agrarian lifestyle of the time. The smell of the outdoors and the fields would be familiar and comforting, associated with Esau's identity as a hunter and man of the field (<a href="/genesis/25-27.htm">Genesis 25:27</a>).<p><b>is like the smell of a field</b><br>Fields in the ancient Near East were vital for sustenance and prosperity. The comparison to a field suggests fertility, abundance, and the provision of God. This imagery is consistent with the blessings of land and prosperity that are central to the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>that the LORD has blessed.</b><br>The invocation of the LORD's blessing ties the patriarchal blessing to divine will and favor. It reflects the belief that all prosperity and success come from God. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises, as seen in the blessings given to Abraham and Isaac, and later to Jacob himself (<a href="/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the father of Esau and Jacob.

Originally the act of kissing had a symbolical character. Here it is a sign of affection between a parent and a child; in <a href="/genesis/29-13.htm">Genesis 29:13</a> between relatives. It was also a token of friendship (Tobit 7. 6; 10:12; <a href="/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48</a>; <a href="/luke/7-45.htm">Luke 7:45</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>; <a href="/acts/20-37.htm">Acts 20:37</a>). The kissing of princes was a symbol of homage (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>; Xenoph., 'Cyrop.,' 7. 5, 32). With the Persians it was a mark of honor (Xenoph., 'Agesil.,' 5. 4). The Rabbins permitted only three kinds of kisses - the kiss of reverence, of reception, and of dismissal. The kiss of charity was practiced among disciples in the early Christian Church (<a href="/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-26.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:26</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-14.htm">1 Peter 5:14</a>; <span class="accented">vide</span> Kitto's' 'Cyclopedia,' art.

The odor of Esau s garments, impregnated with the fragrance of the aromatic herbs of Palestine, excited the dull sensibilities of the aged prophet, suggesting to his mind pictures of freshness and fertility, and inspiring him to pour forth his promised benediction - <span class="cmt_word">and blessed him</span> (not a second time, the statement in ver. 23 being only inserted by anticipation), <span class="cmt_word">and said</span>, - the blessing, as is usual in elevated prophetic utterances, assumes a poetic and antistrophical form (cf. Esau's blessing, vers. 39, 40) - <span class="cmt_word">See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field</span> - the first clause of the poetic stanza clearly connects with the odor of Esau's raiment as that which had opened the fount of prophetic song in Isaac's breast, so far at least as its peculiar form was concerned; its secret inspiration we know was the Holy Ghost operating through Isaac's faith in the promise (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">which the Lord hath blessed</span>. The introduction of the name Jehovah instead of Elohim in this second clause proves that Isaac did not mean to liken his son to an ordinary well-cultivated field, but to "<span class="accented">a</span> field like that of Paradise, resplendent with traces of the Deity - an ideal field, bearing the same relation to an ordinary one as Israel did to the heathen - a kind of enchanted garden, such as would be realized at a later period in Canaan, as far as the fidelity of the people permitted it" (Hengstenberg). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/27-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So he came near</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
