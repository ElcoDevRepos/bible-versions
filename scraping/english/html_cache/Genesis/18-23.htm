In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, approaching a deity or a figure of authority required courage and respect. Abraham's stepping forward signifies his role as an intercessor, a type of Christ who mediates on behalf of others. This act also reflects the intimate relationship Abraham has with God, as seen in <a href="/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>, where Abraham is called a "friend of God."<p><b>Will You really sweep away</b><br>The language here suggests a concern for justice and mercy. The Hebrew word used implies a complete destruction, which Abraham questions. This reflects the biblical theme of God's justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, where God expresses no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Abraham's question anticipates the later biblical revelation of God's character as both just and merciful.<p><b>the righteous with the wicked?</b><br>This phrase highlights the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. Abraham's concern is for the preservation of the righteous, which aligns with God's promise to spare the city if righteous people are found (<a href="/genesis/18-26.htm">Genesis 18:26</a>). This anticipates the New Testament teaching in <a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>, where God is described as able to rescue the godly from trials. Theologically, this also points to the ultimate separation of the righteous and the wicked at the final judgment, as described in <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

After hosting the LORD and the angels, he literally moves toward Him, modeling the confidence believers may have when approaching God (cf. <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Stepping forward also signals readiness to partner with God&#8217;s purposes. Just as Abraham had earlier pursued Lot to rescue him (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14-16</a>), he now pursues God&#8217;s mercy for Lot&#8217;s city.<p>&#8226; The narrative shows that friendship with God involves both listening (<a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>) and responding. Abraham&#8217;s initiative encourages us to engage actively with the Lord&#8217;s revealed plans.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; Conversation, not ceremony, follows. Abraham speaks plainly, confirming the relational nature of prayer (<a href="/jeremiah/29-12.htm">Jeremiah 29:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This intercession rises spontaneously from love for people and reverence for God. Scripture portrays similar pleas&#8212;Moses for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and Paul for his countrymen (<a href="/romans/9-2.htm">Romans 9:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern: hear God&#8217;s word, step near, and speak back promises and concerns to Him (<a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will You really sweep away the righteous</b><p>&#8226; Abraham&#8217;s first concern is God&#8217;s character. He knows the Judge of all the earth will do right (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By framing his petition as a question, he invites affirmation of truths already revealed: the LORD distinguishes the righteous from the wicked (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-18.htm">Malachi 3:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Historical precedents reinforce this hope&#8212;Noah was spared the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>), Rahab survived Jericho&#8217;s fall (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>).

Abraham appeals to divine justice, not human sentimentality.<p>&#8226; Scripture confirms the LORD does not desire to destroy the righteous alongside the wicked (<a href="/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>), and He &#8220;knows how to rescue the godly from trials&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Abraham recognizes real judgment is coming&#8212;&#8220;sweep away&#8221; echoes flood language (<a href="/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>). Mercy is not automatic; it is sought and received through covenant relationship.<p>&#8226; The tension between justice and mercy finds ultimate resolution at the cross, where wrath against sin and salvation for believers meet (<a href="/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abraham models bold, informed intercession: he steps toward God, speaks honestly, and anchors his plea in God&#8217;s righteous character. <a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a> reveals that the LORD&#8217;s justice never arbitrarily conflates the righteous with the wicked, and His covenant people may confidently appeal to that truth for themselves and for others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Abraham drew near.</span>--As Jewish commentators remark, this word is especially used of prayer, and Abraham's intercession is unspeakably noble. Nor must we suppose that he thought only of Lot. Doubtless he remembered the day when he had restored the persons and spoil to the king of Sodom. He had then seen their human affection; the joy of parent meeting with child, and friend with friend; and he hoped that there were good people among them, and that so marvellous a deliverance would work in many of them a true repentance. Neither must we suppose that Abraham adroitly began with a large number, with the intention of lessening it. It was the readiness with which each prayer was heard which made him in his earnestness continue his entreaties. It thus illustrates the principle that the faith of the believer grows strong as he feels that his prayers are accepted, and he ventures finally to offer petitions, nothing wavering, which at an earlier stage would have seemed to him to ask more than he might venture to hope from the Divine goodness.<p><span class= "bld">Destroy.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">sweep away; </span>and so in <a href="/genesis/18-24.htm" title="Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?">Genesis 18:24</a>.

The object the patriarch contemplated in his intercession was not simply the preservation of any godly remnant that might be found within the doomed towns, but the rescue of their entire populations from the impending judgment, - only he does not at first discover his complete design, perhaps regarding such an absolute reversal of the Divine purpose as exceeding the legitimate bounds of creature supplication; but with what might be characterized as holy adroitness he veils his ulterior aim, and commences his petition at a Point somewhat removed from that to which he hopes to come. Assuming it as settled that the fair Pentapolis is to be destroyed, he practically asks, with a strange mixture of humility and boldness, if Jehovah has considered that this will involve a sad commingling in one gigantic overthrow of both the righteous and the wicked. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Abraham</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;r&#257;&#183;h&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_85.htm">Strong's 85: </a> </span><span class="str2">Abraham -- 'exalted father', the father of the Jewish nation</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stepped forward</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yig&#183;ga&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5066.htm">Strong's 5066: </a> </span><span class="str2">To draw near, approach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Will You really</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sweep away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(tis&#183;peh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5595.htm">Strong's 5595: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sweep or snatch away, catch up</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the righteous</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the wicked?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">OT Law: Genesis 18:23 Abraham drew near and said Will you (Gen.
