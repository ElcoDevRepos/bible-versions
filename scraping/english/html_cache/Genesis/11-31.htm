Abram, later known as Abraham, is a central figure in biblical history, often called the "father of faith." This journey marks the beginning of a significant transition in Abram's life, setting the stage for God's covenant with him. Terah's leadership in this move suggests a family decision, possibly influenced by divine prompting, though not explicitly stated here.<p><b>his grandson Lot son of Haran</b><br>Lot, the son of Haran, Abram's brother, is included in this journey. Haran's death may have influenced Terah's decision to take Lot under his care. Lot's presence is crucial for later narratives, including the separation from Abram and the events in Sodom and Gomorrah. This inclusion highlights the familial responsibilities and ties that were important in ancient Near Eastern cultures.<p><b>and his daughter-in-law Sarai the wife of Abram</b><br>Sarai, later named Sarah, is introduced here as Abram's wife. Her role is pivotal in the unfolding story of the Israelite nation, particularly concerning the promise of a son, Isaac. Sarai's barrenness at this point sets the stage for future divine intervention and the miraculous birth of Isaac, which is a type of the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ.<p><b>and they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans</b><br>Ur of the Chaldeans is an ancient city located in modern-day southern Iraq. Archaeological findings suggest it was a prosperous city with advanced culture and religion. The departure from Ur signifies a break from a polytheistic environment, moving towards a monotheistic faith journey. This move is a physical and spiritual departure, symbolizing a call to follow God's leading.<p><b>for the land of Canaan</b><br>Canaan is the land promised by God to Abram and his descendants. It represents the fulfillment of God's promises and is central to the biblical narrative. The journey to Canaan is a step of faith, as it was a land unknown to them. Canaan later becomes the land of Israel, central to biblical prophecy and the history of God's people.<p><b>But when they arrived in Haran, they settled there</b><br>Haran, located in modern-day Turkey, becomes a temporary dwelling place for Terah and his family. The settlement in Haran suggests a pause in the journey, possibly due to Terah's age or health. This delay is significant as it sets the stage for God's direct call to Abram to continue to Canaan after Terah's death. Haran is also a center of moon worship, similar to Ur, indicating that the full transition to monotheistic worship was still in progress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/terah.htm">Terah</a></b><br>The father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

Each phrase underlines God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration&#8212;selecting Abram, preserving Lot, preparing Sarai, and guiding their path.

The name must not be confounded with that of Haran, the father of Lot, as really it is in the Heb. <span class= "ital">Kharan, </span>and was so called in Accadian times, in which language the word means <span class= "ital">"</span>road," being, according to Mr. Sayce, the key of the highway from the east to the west. It was both a very early and a very late outpost of Chaldean power. (Tomkins' <span class= "ital">Studies on Times of Abraham, 55ff</span>.)<p>Terah's migration was partly perhaps a movement of a tribe of the Semites northwards (see Note on <a href="/genesis/11-28.htm" title="And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.">Genesis 11:28</a>), made restless by the Elamites, who about this time overran Western Asia; but chiefly it had a religious motive: for Ur was the especial seat of the worship of the moon-god, Sin; and though Terah had not attained to the purity of Abraham's faith, yet neither was he altogether an idolater. But why did they intend "to go into the land of Canaan?" As Abram subsequently continued this migration in simple dependance upon God's guidance (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>), it was probably the Divine rather than the human purpose that is here expressed. Still, there may have been some tradition in the family, or knowledge handed down from patriarchal times, which made them look upon Canaan as their land of hope; and the expedition of Amraphel, king of Shinar, and others against the south of Palestine, recorded in <a href="/context/genesis/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;">Genesis 14:1-16</a>, and confirmed by our large present knowledge of these popular movements, shows that we must not assume that, far removed from one another as were Babylonia and Canaan, therefore they were lands mutually unknown. We gather also that the Divine summons came to Abram in Ur (see &#174;<a href="/genesis/15-7.htm" title="And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; <a href="/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>), but we learn in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a> that his final destination was not then definitely told him. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Terah took</span> - an act of pure human volition on the part of Terah (Kalisch); under the guidance of God's ordinary providence (Keil); but more probably, as Abram was called in Ur (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), prompted by a knowledge of his son's call, and a desire to participate in his son's inheritance (Lange) - <span class="cmt_word">Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife.</span> The Samaritan reads, "and Milcah his daughter-in-law, the wives of Abram and Nahor his sons," with an obvious intention to account for the appearance of Nahor as a settler in Charran (Genesis 24:10); but it is better to understand the migration of Nahor and his family as having taken place subsequent to Terah's departure. <span class="cmt_word">And they went forth with them</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> Lot and Sarai with Terah and Abram (Keil); or, better, Terah and Abram with Lot and Sarai (Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Murphy, 'Speaker's Commentary); though best is the interpretation, "and they went forth with each other" (Lange, Kalisch).
