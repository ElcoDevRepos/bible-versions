The imagery of "archers" suggests those who launch attacks from a distance, indicating the calculated and deliberate nature of the hostility Joseph experienced. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual battles faced by believers, where adversaries may attack with malice and intent to harm. The bitterness highlights the deep-seated resentment and envy that Joseph's brothers harbored against him, as seen in <a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>, where they could not speak peaceably to him. This bitterness is a recurring theme in Scripture, warning against the destructive nature of envy and hatred (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>).<p><b>they aimed at him in hostility.</b><br>The phrase "aimed at him in hostility" underscores the intentional and targeted nature of the attacks against Joseph. This hostility is not random but directed, reflecting the personal vendetta his brothers had due to their jealousy of his favored status and dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>). Historically, this enmity led to Joseph being sold into slavery, a pivotal event that God used to fulfill His greater plan for Joseph and the nation of Israel. This aligns with the biblical theme of God using human evil for divine purposes (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>). Theologically, Joseph is often seen as a type of Christ, who also faced hostility and rejection from His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>), yet through His suffering, brought about salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, Joseph is one of the twelve sons of Jacob.
