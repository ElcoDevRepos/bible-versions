In <a href="/genesis/17.htm">Genesis 17</a>, God reaffirms His covenant with Abraham, which was initially established in <a href="/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>. This covenant is not only with Abraham but extends to his descendants, indicating a perpetual promise. The covenant includes the promise of land, numerous descendants, and a special relationship with God. This covenantal relationship is foundational to the identity of Israel as God's chosen people and is later expanded in the New Testament to include all believers through faith in Jesus Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>).<p><b>which you are to keep</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the responsibility of Abraham and his descendants to uphold their part of the covenant. This involves obedience and faithfulness to God's commands. The requirement to "keep" the covenant highlights the conditional aspect of the relationship, where blessings are contingent upon adherence to God's stipulations. This concept of covenantal faithfulness is echoed throughout Scripture, where obedience is seen as a response to God's grace and a demonstration of faith (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>Every male among you must be circumcised</b><br>Circumcision is introduced as the physical sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants. This practice was not unique to Israel, as it was also observed by other ancient Near Eastern cultures, but it held a distinct theological significance for the Israelites. It symbolized the cutting away of the flesh, representing a commitment to purity and separation unto God. Circumcision served as a constant reminder of the covenant and the identity of the Israelites as God's people. In the New Testament, circumcision becomes a type of spiritual circumcision, where the focus shifts to the circumcision of the heart, symbolizing inner transformation and faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The initiator of the covenant, establishing a sign of His promise with Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch with whom God establishes His covenant, marking a significant moment in the Abrahamic account.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_abraham.htm">Descendants of Abraham</a></b><br>The future generations who are to uphold the covenant through the act of circumcision.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>A solemn agreement between God and Abraham, signifying a lasting relationship and commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/circumcision.htm">Circumcision</a></b><br>The physical sign of the covenant, representing obedience and dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Understand the significance of God's covenant with Abraham as a foundational moment in biblical history, establishing a relationship that extends to all believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_faith.htm">Obedience and Faith</a></b><br>Recognize that while circumcision was a physical act of obedience, it pointed to a deeper spiritual truth of faith and commitment to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_circumcision.htm">Symbolism of Circumcision</a></b><br>Reflect on how circumcision symbolizes the cutting away of sin and the call to live a life set apart for God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_and_fulfillment.htm">Continuity and Fulfillment</a></b><br>Consider how the Old Testament covenant finds its fulfillment in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who brings a new covenant of grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_circumcision.htm">Spiritual Circumcision</a></b><br>Embrace the concept of spiritual circumcision, where believers are called to remove sin from their lives and live in the newness of life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_17_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 17:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_17_10_Covenant_definition.htm">How does Genesis 17:10 define the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_circumcision_in_Gen_17_10.htm">Why is circumcision significant in Genesis 17:10 for Abraham's covenant with God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_17_10_and_spiritual_circumcision_link.htm">How does Genesis 17:10 connect to New Testament teachings on spiritual circumcision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christians_honor_Genesis_17_10.htm">What practical steps can Christians take to honor God's covenant in Genesis 17:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_17_10_s_impact_on_faith_obedience.htm">How does Genesis 17:10 influence our understanding of obedience in faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_circumcision_the_covenant_sign.htm">Why is circumcision chosen as the sign of the covenant in Genesis 17:10?

A covenant is more than a casual promise; it is a binding, oath-sealed relationship. Here, the Lord establishes something permanent, echoing earlier assurances (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>; 15:18). Just as in <a href="/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17-18</a> God &#8220;confirmed it with an oath,&#8221; this announcement shows His unwavering commitment. The focus should never drift to the human participants first; it begins with God&#8217;s sovereign, gracious declaration: &#8220;This is My covenant.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with you and your descendants after you</b><p>The promise extends beyond Abraham to Isaac, Jacob, and the entire nation that will spring from them (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>; 28:13-14). The Lord&#8217;s plan spans generations, underscoring that faithfulness today impacts tomorrow&#8217;s children (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). What God puts into place here ultimately blesses &#8220;all the families of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), culminating in Christ, the Seed promised in <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>.

Abraham is saved by faith (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>; <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>), yet that faith bears fruit in practical submission. &#8220;Keep&#8221; implies watchfulness and care, the same verb used later for Israel keeping God&#8217;s law (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). God&#8217;s covenants carry obligations&#8212;never as a means to earn His favor, but as the appropriate response to it (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every male among you</b><p>No one in Abraham&#8217;s household is exempt, whether natural-born or purchased servant (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12-13</a>).

The act foreshadows deeper truths: a call to &#8220;circumcise your hearts&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>) and, ultimately, the spiritual circumcision made &#8220;without hands&#8221; in Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-12</a>). Yet for Abraham and Israel, the command is literal and binding&#8212;any refusal means being &#8220;cut off&#8221; from the people (<a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>). The sign is serious because the covenant is holy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10</a> reveals a God-initiated, multi-generational covenant grounded in grace and sealed with a command. Every male in Abraham&#8217;s line is literally circumcised, signaling total devotion and setting the stage for the heart-circumcision fulfilled in Christ. Obedience here is not optional; it is the grateful response to God&#8217;s steadfast promise&#8212;an enduring pattern for all who walk by faith today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Shall be circumcised.</span>--It is stated by Herodotus (Book ii. 104) that the Egyptians were circumcised, and that the Syrians in Palestine confessed that they learned this practice from the Egyptians. Origen, however, seems to limit circumcision to the priesthood (Epist. ad Rom., ? ii. 13); and the statement of Herodotus is not only very loose, but his date is too far posterior to the time of Abram for us to be able to place implicit confidence in it. If we turn to the evidence of Egyptian monuments and of the mummies, we find proof of the rite having become general in Egypt only in quite recent times. The discussion is, however, merely of archaeological importance; for circumcision was just as appropriate a sign of the covenant if borrowed from institutions already existing as if then used for the first time. It is, moreover, an acknowledged fact that the Bible is always true to the local colouring. Chaldaean influence is predominant in those early portions of Genesis which we owe to Abram, a citizen of Ur of the Chaldees; his life and surroundings subsequently are those of an Arab sheik; while Egyptian influence is strongly marked in the latter part of Genesis, and in the history of the Exodus from that country. In this fact we have a sufficient answer to the theories which would bring down the composition of the Pentateuch to a late period: for the author would certainly have written in accordance with the facts and ideas of his own times. If, however, Abram had seen circumcision in Egypt, when the famine drove him thither, and had learned the significance of the rite, and that the idea of it was connected with moral purity, there was in this even a reason why God should choose it as the outward sign of the sacrament which He was now bestowing upon the patriarch.<p>The fitness of circumcision to be a sign of entering into a covenant, and especially into one to which children were to be admitted, consisted in its being a representation of a new birth by the putting off of the old man, and the dedication of the new man unto holiness. The flesh was cast away that the spirit might grow strong; and the change of name in Abram and Sarai was typical of this change of condition. They had been born again, and so must again be named. And though women could not indeed be admitted directly into the covenant, yet they shared in its privileges by virtue of their consanguinity to the men, who were as sponsors for them; and thus Sarai changes her name equally with her husband.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is my covenant</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sign of it, as in <a href="/genesis/9-12.htm">Genesis 9:12</a>), <span class="cmt_word">which ye shall keep</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> observe to. do), <span class="cmt_word">between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised</span>.
