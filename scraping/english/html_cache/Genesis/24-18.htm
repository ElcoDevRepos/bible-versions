The term "my lord" indicates respect and humility, which were important values in patriarchal societies. This encounter takes place at a well, a central location for social interaction and resource gathering. The use of "my lord" also foreshadows the respect and submission that Rebekah will later show as Isaac's wife, aligning with the biblical theme of servanthood and respect within relationships.<p><b>and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands</b><br>Rebekah's quick action demonstrates her willingness and eagerness to serve, a trait that is highly valued in biblical narratives. The act of lowering the jar to her hands suggests a readiness to meet the needs of others, paralleling the servant-hearted nature of Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). This gesture also highlights the physical effort involved, indicating her strength and capability, qualities that would be important for her future role in the lineage of Israel.<p><b>and gave him a drink</b><br>This act of giving water is symbolic of life and sustenance, echoing other biblical instances where water is a metaphor for spiritual nourishment (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>). Rebekah's provision of water can be seen as a type of Christ, who offers the living water of eternal life. Her actions fulfill the servant's prayer for a sign, confirming God's guidance in choosing a wife for Isaac. This moment is pivotal in the Abrahamic narrative, as it leads to the continuation of God's covenant through Isaac and Rebekah's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A young woman of marriageable age, known for her beauty and kindness.

In that single word we see:<p>&#8226; Immediate hospitality&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; praise for giving &#8220;even a cup of cold water&#8221; to those in need (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>, <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>).<p>&#8226; Sensitivity to practical needs&#8212;much like the Samaritan woman who drew water for Jesus in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7&#8211;10</a>. Rebekah models the heart of a servant before she ever speaks a second sentence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my lord</b><p>Calling a stranger &#8220;my lord&#8221; shows respectful humility. Scripture commends such deference:<p>&#8226; Sarah addressed Abraham as &#8220;my lord&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>, <a href="/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>), illustrating reverence that flows from a trusting heart.<p>&#8226; Rebekah&#8217;s politeness previews later commands for believers to &#8220;serve with goodwill, as to the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5&#8211;7</a>).<p>Her language is not flattery; it is a window into a character shaped by courtesy and self-forgetting kindness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she replied</b><p>Rebekah&#8217;s response is immediate&#8212;no hesitation, no excuses. This echoes others who promptly said, &#8220;Speak, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) or &#8220;Behold, I am the servant of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>). The principle is simple:<p>&#8226; Godly people answer needs swiftly, trusting Him with the outcome.<p>&#8226; Readiness to respond often precedes God&#8217;s greater reveal, as it does here in leading her to Isaac.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands</b><p>Speed and effort mark genuine service. The text highlights that she moved &#8220;quickly,&#8221; mirroring verses that urge diligence:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do not be slothful in zeal; be fervent in spirit&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/31-19.htm">Proverbs 31:19</a> praises the virtuous woman who works eagerly with her hands.<p>Lowering the heavy clay jar meant bending, possibly splashing herself, but love never counts the cost. Her swift action shows faith lived out through energetic work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave him a drink</b><p>Rebekah completes the task. Action, not mere intention, satisfies thirst. Other examples of completed mercy include:<p>&#8226; Abraham setting a full meal before the angels (<a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The Good Samaritan dressing wounds and paying for the inn (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus washing the disciples&#8217; feet and saying, &#8220;You also should do as I have done to you&#8221; (<a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>).<p>Faith expresses itself in tangible deeds that refresh weary travelers (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-18.htm">Genesis 24:18</a> captures the essence of godly hospitality: a ready word of welcome, respectful address, swift obedience, energetic effort, and completed service. Rebekah&#8217;s single verse of kindness becomes the hinge on which God&#8217;s covenant plan swings, leading to her marriage with Isaac and the unfolding promises to Israel. Her example calls every believer to meet needs promptly, humbly, and wholeheartedly, trusting that simple acts of mercy carry eternal significance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Drink,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8354.htm">Strong's 8354: </a> </span><span class="str2">To imbibe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my lord,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
