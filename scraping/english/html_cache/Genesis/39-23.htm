In the context of ancient Egyptian prisons, a warden would typically oversee all activities and ensure order. However, Joseph's integrity and God's favor allowed him to gain the warden's complete trust. This mirrors Joseph's earlier experience in Potiphar's house, where he was also entrusted with significant responsibility. The trust placed in Joseph foreshadows his future role as a leader in Egypt, demonstrating how God prepares His chosen servants for greater tasks.<p><b>because the LORD was with Joseph</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine presence and favor that Joseph experienced throughout his life. The recurring theme of God's presence with Joseph is a testament to the covenant relationship between God and His people. It reflects the broader biblical narrative where God's presence signifies blessing, guidance, and protection. This divine companionship is a precursor to the New Testament promise of God's presence with believers through the Holy Spirit. Joseph's life serves as a type of Christ, who also experienced God's presence and favor in His earthly ministry.<p><b>and gave him success in whatever he did</b><br>The success Joseph experienced is attributed directly to God's intervention. This success is not merely material or professional but encompasses all aspects of his life, reflecting the biblical principle that true prosperity comes from God. Joseph's ability to thrive in adverse circumstances is a testament to God's sovereignty and faithfulness. This phrase connects to other scriptural promises of prosperity for those who are faithful to God, such as in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>.
