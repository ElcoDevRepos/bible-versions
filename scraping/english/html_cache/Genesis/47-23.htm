This phrase highlights his role as an intermediary between the Egyptian people and Pharaoh. Joseph's leadership and wisdom are evident as he navigates the challenges of a severe famine. His actions are a fulfillment of the dreams he had as a young man, where he saw his family bowing to him, symbolizing his future authority and responsibility.<p><b>Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day</b><br>This statement reflects the economic and social conditions of the time. Due to the severe famine, the Egyptians had sold their livestock, land, and even themselves to Pharaoh in exchange for food. This transaction indicates the centralization of power and resources under Pharaoh's control, facilitated by Joseph. It also underscores the desperation of the people and the extent of the famine's impact. The acquisition of land and people for Pharaoh can be seen as a precursor to the later enslavement of the Israelites, setting a historical context for the eventual Exodus.<p><b>here is seed for you to sow in the land</b><br>Joseph provides the people with seed, ensuring their survival and the continuation of agricultural productivity. This act of giving seed is significant as it represents hope and the possibility of renewal after a period of hardship. It also reflects Joseph's strategic planning and foresight, as he ensures that the people can sustain themselves and contribute to the economy once the famine ends. The provision of seed can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and hope for renewal. This act of provision parallels the biblical theme of God providing for His people, as seen in other scriptures such as the manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and Jesus feeding the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery by his brothers and rose to become the second most powerful man in Egypt.

Though he represents royal authority, he transparently explains the arrangement instead of imposing it without dialogue&#8212;mirroring the righteous leadership God commends in passages like <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>.<p>&#8226; By taking the initiative to speak, Joseph also reassures them that their survival is secure, echoing the comfort God repeatedly gives His people in crisis moments (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ownership transferred to Pharaoh</b><p>&#8220;Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/47-23.htm">Genesis 47:23</a>b)<p>&#8226; The famine forced Egyptians to sell first their livestock, then their land, and finally themselves (<a href="/genesis/47-15.htm">Genesis 47:15&#8211;22</a>). Joseph legally formalizes that reality.<p>&#8226; Scripture presents this as an act of stewardship, not exploitation:<p>&#8211; Pharaoh, as sovereign, now bears responsibility for the people&#8217;s welfare; compare the pattern in <a href="/1_samuel/8-14.htm">1 Samuel 8:14&#8211;15</a> where a king likewise claims land yet must provide protection.<p>&#8211; Joseph&#8217;s integrity is consistent with God&#8217;s law that rulers use authority for the common good (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The shift in ownership underlines a biblical truth: &#8220;The earth is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>). Human possession is always secondary stewardship&#8212;a theme later echoed when Israel learns that even their Promised Land ultimately belongs to God (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the people escape starvation; spiritually, they learn dependence, a lesson God reinforces throughout His dealings with nations (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Provision of seed for sowing</b><p>&#8220;here is seed for you to sow in the land.&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/47-23.htm">Genesis 47:23</a>c)<p>&#8226; Joseph immediately places seed in their hands&#8212;a tangible sign of hope. God often couples discipline or loss with fresh provision (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; The gift of seed highlights balanced economics:<p>&#8211; Pharaoh retains land, yet citizens retain labor and receive capital to rebuild.<p>&#8211; A fair fixed tax of one-fifth will follow (<a href="/genesis/47-24.htm">Genesis 47:24</a>), leaving 80 % for the farmers&#8212;remarkably generous compared to other ancient regimes.<p>&#8226; Seed pictures future blessing: when Isaac sowed during famine, God multiplied his yield a hundredfold (<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12</a>); similarly, God &#8220;supplies seed to the sower and bread for food&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By accepting the seed, the Egyptians exercise faith that the drought will end, paralleling <a href="/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5&#8211;6</a> where sowing in tears leads to reaping with joy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-23.htm">Genesis 47:23</a> records Joseph&#8217;s gracious administration in famine: he speaks candidly, formalizes Pharaoh&#8217;s ownership as a means of protection, and equips the people with seed so they can sow and live. The verse showcases responsible leadership, the truth that all land ultimately belongs to God, and the hope-filled principle that the Lord never leaves His creation without the means to begin again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Lo, here is seed for you.</span>--As Joseph would give them seed wherewith to sow their fields only when the famine was nearly over, these arrangements seem to have been completed shortly before the end of the seventh year; and then, with seed it would be necessary also to supply them with oxen to plough the soil, and swine wherewith to trample in the seed (Rawlinson, <span class= "ital">Egypt, </span>i. 76). A fifth part of the produce would be a very moderate rent, especially as there were no rates or taxes to be paid. The whole expenses of the State had to be defrayed from this rent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</span> This proves the time to have been the last year of the famine; and since the people obtained seed from the viceroy, it is reasonable to suppose that they would also have their cattle restored to them to enable them to till the ground. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.</span> This verse is a sufficient refutation of the oft-preferred charge that Joseph had despoiled the Egyptians of their liberties, and converted a free people into a horde of abject slaves. Slave-owners are not usually content with a tax of only twenty percent on the gross revenues of their estates. Nor does it seem reasonable to allege that this was an exorbitant demand on the part either of Joseph or of Pharaoh. If in the seven years of plenty the people could afford to part with a fifth part of their produce, might not an improved system of agriculture enable them, under the new regulations, to pay as much as that in the shape of rent, and with quite as much ease? At all events the people themselves did not consider that they were being subjected to any harsh or unjust exaction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/47-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joseph</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1505;&#1461;&#1507;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;s&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3130.htm">Strong's 3130: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joseph -- 'he increases', a son of Jacob, also the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Now that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
