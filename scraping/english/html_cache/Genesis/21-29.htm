His interactions with Abraham highlight themes of covenant and divine protection. Abimelech's inquiry reflects the customs of the time, where leaders often engaged in negotiations and treaties to ensure peace and mutual understanding. This interaction follows a previous encounter where God warned Abimelech in a dream regarding Sarah, Abraham's wife, emphasizing God's protection over His chosen people.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?&#8221;</b><br>The act of setting apart seven ewe lambs is symbolic and significant in ancient Near Eastern culture. The number seven often represents completeness or perfection in the Bible, seen in the creation account and various other contexts. The ewe lambs serve as a witness or testimony to the covenant between Abraham and Abimelech, ensuring that the well of Beersheba belonged to Abraham. This act of setting apart is reminiscent of other biblical covenants, such as God's covenant with Noah and later with Israel. The lambs can also be seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who is set apart for the redemption of humanity, highlighting themes of sacrifice and covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>A Philistine king who forms a covenant with Abraham.
