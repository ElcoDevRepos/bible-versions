This acquisition of land reflects the centralization of authority, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. Joseph's actions can be seen as a fulfillment of the dreams he interpreted for Pharaoh, where he foresaw the need to prepare for a severe famine. This centralization also foreshadows the later enslavement of the Israelites, as the Egyptians themselves become dependent on Pharaoh's provisions. Joseph's role as a savior figure during the famine can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and salvation.<p><b>the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them.</b><br>The severity of the famine forced the Egyptians to sell their land, highlighting the desperation and dire circumstances they faced. This reflects the historical reality of famines in the ancient world, which often led to significant social and economic upheaval. The phrase "one and all" emphasizes the widespread impact of the famine, affecting every level of society. This situation can be compared to the spiritual famine described in <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>, where there is a lack of hearing the words of the Lord. The Egyptians' willingness to sell their fields underscores the theme of reliance on a higher power for survival, paralleling the spiritual dependence on God.<p><b>The land became Pharaoh&#8217;s,</b><br>The transfer of land ownership to Pharaoh signifies a shift in economic and social structures, with Pharaoh gaining unprecedented control over the resources of Egypt. This centralization of land under Pharaoh's control can be seen as a precursor to the later enslavement of the Israelites, as it sets a precedent for the absolute authority of the Egyptian ruler. Theologically, this can be viewed as a reminder of God's sovereignty over all creation, as ultimately, all land and resources belong to Him. The consolidation of land under Pharaoh also serves as a backdrop for the eventual Exodus, where God demonstrates His power and authority over earthly rulers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt as Pharaoh's second-in-command.

By purchasing the land, Joseph:<p>&#8226; fulfilled the administrative responsibility God had arranged through his earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; demonstrated good stewardship, turning a national crisis into ordered provision, echoing <a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a> about diligence bringing promotion.<p>&#8226; set up a centralized system that would later support Israel&#8217;s migration and growth in Goshen (<a href="/genesis/47-27.htm">Genesis 47:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields</b><p>Every private landholder surrendered ownership, an action that:<p>&#8226; showed how deeply personal resources can be exhausted in prolonged hardship (<a href="/genesis/47-18.htm">Genesis 47:18&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; mirrored the warning in <a href="/1_samuel/8-14.htm">1 Samuel 8:14&#8211;17</a>, where a king&#8217;s authority can claim fields and vineyards.<p>&#8226; affirmed that in the end, land truly belongs to the Lord, not individuals (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the famine was so severe upon them.</b><p>The severity had been divinely foretold (<a href="/genesis/41-30.htm">Genesis 41:30&#8211;31</a>). Now, two years into the famine (<a href="/genesis/45-6.htm">Genesis 45:6</a>), desperation pushed citizens to trade the last of their assets simply to survive. The scene recalls later famines like the one during Israel&#8217;s siege in <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>, underscoring how unchecked scarcity drives extreme decisions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The land became Pharaoh&#8217;s</b><p>With ownership transferred, Pharaoh gained unprecedented economic and political power. Joseph then instituted a nationwide policy: farmers would work the land but return a fifth of produce to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/47-26.htm">Genesis 47:26</a>). This arrangement:<p>&#8226; secured food distribution for the remaining five years of famine.<p>&#8226; foreshadowed the growing dominance of the Egyptian monarchy that eventually oppressed Israel (<a href="/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; illustrated that governmental authority, while God-ordained (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), can expand rapidly in crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/47-20.htm">Genesis 47:20</a> records a pivotal moment in Egypt&#8217;s history, showing Joseph faithfully managing a dire famine by lawfully purchasing all land for Pharaoh. The people relinquished ownership because survival mattered more than property. God&#8217;s providential plan placed Joseph in authority, protected Israel in Goshen, and demonstrated how crises reveal true ownership: everything ultimately belongs to the Lord, who guides events for His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/47.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">So the land became Pharaoh's.</span>--Joseph has been accused of reducing a free people to slavery by his policy. Undoubtedly he did vastly increase the royal power; but from what we read of the vassalage under which the Egyptians lived to a multitude of petty sovereigns, and also to their wives, their priests, and their embalmers, an increase in the power of the king, so as to make it predominant, would be to their advantage. The statement made here that the land in Egypt belonged entirely to the king is confirmed by Herodotus and other Greek authorities. The same is the case in India at this day; only, instead of the rent being a fifth part of the produce, it is in India a fixed annual sum, which is settled at comparatively distant intervals. In Burmah the agriculturists hold their land directly from the Crown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the land became Pharaoh's</span>.
