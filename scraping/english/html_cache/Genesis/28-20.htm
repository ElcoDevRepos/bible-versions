Jacob's vow here is significant as it marks a pivotal moment in his spiritual journey. Vows were binding and taken seriously, reflecting a deep commitment to fulfill one's promise to God. This vow follows Jacob's dream at Bethel, where God reaffirmed the Abrahamic covenant to him, indicating a personal relationship with God.<p><b>&#8220;If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey,</b><br>Jacob's request for God's presence and protection reflects a common biblical theme of divine guidance and safeguarding. The journey Jacob refers to is his flight from Beersheba to Haran, a journey fraught with potential dangers. This echoes God's promise to Abraham and Isaac of His presence and protection. The conditional "if" suggests Jacob's growing faith and reliance on God, acknowledging his need for divine assistance. This request for God's presence is reminiscent of God's assurance to Moses in <a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."<p><b>and if He will provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear,</b><br>Jacob's request for basic necessities highlights the human dependence on God for sustenance and provision. In the ancient world, food and clothing were fundamental needs, and their provision was often seen as a sign of divine blessing. This reflects the biblical principle that God is the provider of all needs, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>, where Jesus teaches about trusting God for daily necessities. Jacob's focus on these essentials underscores his humility and recognition of God's role as the sustainer of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham and son of Isaac, Jacob is a central figure in this passage.

The promise Jacob had just heard&#8212;&#8220;I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go&#8221; (v. 15)&#8212;draws a personal, conscious response.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, making a vow is a serious, binding act (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). Jacob is not bargaining; he is committing himself in light of God&#8217;s already-given word.<p>&#8226; Later, Jacob remembers and fulfills this promise (<a href="/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1-3</a>), showing that vows invite long-term obedience, not momentary emotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If God will be with me</b><p>&#8226; Jacob echoes the very words God spoke: &#8220;I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>). This &#8220;if&#8221; is the language of dependence, not doubt&#8212;comparable to Moses&#8217; plea, &#8220;If Your Presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s constant presence is a repeated covenant theme (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). Jacob stakes his future on it.<p>&#8226; By aligning his request with God&#8217;s promise, Jacob models faith that lets promises shape prayers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and watch over me on this journey</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Watch over&#8221; reflects God&#8217;s protective shepherding. The same Hebrew verb appears in <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>, &#8220;The LORD will guard you from all evil; He will preserve your soul&#8230; your coming and going&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s journey is more than travel; it is a decades-long sojourn in Haran (<a href="/bsb/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29&#8211;31</a>).

Rather than negotiating, Jacob aligns his life with divine promises, trusting God for guidance on the journey, daily bread, and basic clothing&#8212;picture-perfect reminders that every step, bite, and garment testify to the faithfulness of the covenant-keeping God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20-22) <span class= "bld">Then shall the Lord (Jehovah) be my God.</span>--This is a false translation, and gives a wrong sense. Jacob, in his vow, which implies no doubt on his part, but is his acceptance of the terms of the covenant, says: "If Elohim will be with me, and will protect me on this journey that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear, and if I come again in peace to my father's house, and Jehovah will be my Elohim, then this stone which I have set up as a pillar shall be Beth-Elohiin; and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely pay thee tithes." <a href="/context/genesis/28-20.htm" title="And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,">Genesis 28:20-21</a> are a recapitulation of the mercies of which he was to be the recipient, while in <a href="/genesis/28-22.htm" title="And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that you shall give me I will surely give the tenth to you.">Genesis 28:22</a> Jacob states what shall be his vow of gratitude.<p>But what was a Beth-Elohim? It has been supposed that it was a sort of cromlech, set up to be itself an object of adoration. Attention has also been called to the Baitylia, or stones "possessed of a soul," which the Ph?nicians are said by Eusebius (<span class= "ital">Praep. Evang. </span>i. 10) to have worshipped; and it has been thought, with some probability, that the word is a corrupt form of the Hebrew Beth-Elohim. These Baitylia. however, were meteoric stones, and their sanctity arose from their having fallen from heaven. Stones, moreover, set up at first simply as memorials may in time have been worshipped, and hence the prohibition in <a href="/leviticus/26-1.htm" title="You shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither raise you up a standing image, neither shall you set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 26:1</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/16-22.htm" title="Neither shall you set you up any image; which the LORD your God hates.">Deuteronomy 16:22</a>; but there is no trace of any such idolatrous tendency here. Jacob apparently meant by a Beth-Elohim a place where prayer and offerings would be acceptable, because God ad manifested Himself there; and His vow signified that if, preserved by Jehovah's care, he was permitted to visit the place again, he would consecrate it to Jehovah's service, and spend there in sacrifice, or in some other way to His honour, the tithe of whatever property he might have acquired.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jacob vowed a vow</span>, - not in any mercenary or doubtful spirit, but as an expression of gratitude for the Divine mercy (Calvin), as the soul's full and free acceptance of the Lord to be its own God (Murphy), as the instinctive impulse of the new creature (Candlish) - <span class="cmt_word">saying, If</span> (not the language of uncertainty, but equivalent to "since, ' or "forasmuch as;" Jacob by faith both appropriating and anticipating the fulfillment of the preceding promise) <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (Elohim; for the reason of which <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>will be with me,</span> - as he has promised (ver. 15), and as I believe he will - <span class="cmt_word">and will keep me in this way that I go</span>, - a particular appropriation of the general promise (ver. 15) - <span class="cmt_word">and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all the necessaries of life, included, though not specially mentioned, in the preceding promise), <span class="cmt_word">so that I come again to my father's house</span> - also guaranteed by God (ver. 15), and here accepted by the patriarch - <span class="cmt_word">in peace</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. especially free from Esau's avenging threats); <span class="cmt_word">then shall the Lord be my God</span> - literally, <span class="accented">and Jehovah will be to me for Elohim</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, Keil, Kalisch, 'Speaker's Commentary'), though the received translation is not without support (LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Calvin, Michaelis, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth); but to have bargained and bartered with God in the way which this suggests before assenting to accept him as an object of trust and worship would have been little less than criminal. Accordingly, the clause is best placed in the protasis of the sentence, which then practically reads, "if Elohim will be Jehovah to me, and if Jehovah will be to me Elohim" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hengstenberg, 'Introduction,' vol. 1. p. 358). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/28-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3290.htm">Strong's 3290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jacob -- a son of Isaac, also his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yid&#183;dar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
