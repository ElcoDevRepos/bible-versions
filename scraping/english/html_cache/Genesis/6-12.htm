God's ability to see and understand the state of the earth is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing His omniscience. In <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, God saw that His creation was "very good," but now He observes a stark contrast. This divine inspection sets the stage for the forthcoming judgment, similar to how God later observes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20-21</a>.<p><b>and saw that it was corrupt;</b><br>The term "corrupt" suggests moral decay and deviation from God's intended order. This corruption is not limited to humanity but extends to the entire creation, reflecting the pervasive impact of sin. The Hebrew word used here, "shachath," implies destruction and ruin, indicating that the earth's condition is beyond repair. This corruption is a direct result of humanity's sin, as seen in the narrative of the fall in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>for all living creatures on the earth</b><br>This phrase highlights the universality of the corruption. It includes not only humans but all living beings, suggesting that the sin of humanity has affected the entire creation. This idea is echoed in <a href="/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20-22</a>, where Paul speaks of creation being subjected to futility and groaning for redemption. The interconnectedness of creation and humanity's role as stewards is evident here, as the fall of man leads to the fall of creation.<p><b>had corrupted their ways.</b><br>The phrase "their ways" refers to the conduct and behavior of all living creatures. This corruption of ways indicates a departure from the path of righteousness and God's design. The use of "ways" can be seen as a metaphor for lifestyle or moral conduct, similar to how the "way of the righteous" is described in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>. This corruption necessitates divine intervention, foreshadowing the coming flood as a means of purging the earth and starting anew with Noah, who is described as righteous in his generation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Creator who observes the state of His creation.
