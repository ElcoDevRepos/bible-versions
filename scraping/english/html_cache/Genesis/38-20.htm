His actions in this chapter are pivotal in the lineage of the Messiah. Hirah the Adullamite is mentioned as Judah's friend, indicating a close relationship. Adullam was a Canaanite city, suggesting Judah's integration into local society, which was common for Israelites during this period. This friendship highlights the cultural exchanges and alliances between the Israelites and Canaanites.<p><b>with the young goat</b><br>The young goat was a common form of payment or pledge in ancient Near Eastern cultures. It was often used in transactions and agreements, symbolizing wealth and trustworthiness. This detail underscores the economic practices of the time and reflects the agrarian society in which livestock was a primary measure of wealth.<p><b>to collect the items he had left with the woman</b><br>Judah had left personal items as a pledge with Tamar, whom he did not recognize as his daughter-in-law. These items included his seal, cord, and staff, which were significant personal identifiers. The seal was used to authenticate documents, the cord was likely part of his attire, and the staff symbolized authority. This act of leaving personal items as a pledge was a common practice in ancient times, ensuring the fulfillment of a promise or agreement.<p><b>he could not find her</b><br>This phrase indicates the mysterious and unexpected nature of the encounter. Tamar's disappearance after the transaction suggests her strategic planning to secure her rights and future. This moment is crucial in the narrative, as it sets the stage for Judah's later realization and acknowledgment of his actions. The inability to find her also reflects the transient and often hidden nature of certain social interactions in ancient cultures, especially those involving women and marginalized individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah plays a significant role in the lineage of Jesus Christ.

Earlier he had promised the disguised Tamar, &#8220;I will send you a young goat from my flock&#8221; (v. 17). By &#8220;sending,&#8221; Judah tries to settle a debt quietly, hoping to keep his sin unseen. Scripture repeatedly shows that secrecy never nullifies responsibility&#8212;see <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a> (&#8220;be sure your sin will find you out&#8221;), and <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a> (&#8220;He who conceals his sins will not prosper&#8221;). Judah&#8217;s initiative displays a conscience stirred but not yet repentant: he wants the matter closed, not cleansed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his friend Hirah the Adullamite</b><p>Rather than go himself, Judah enlists Hirah. Friends can either strengthen righteousness or enable wrongdoing (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). Hirah&#8217;s willingness to act as courier underscores Judah&#8217;s social standing and influence; yet his presence also shields Judah from immediate exposure. Earlier, Hirah is linked to Judah during the sheep-shearing feast (v. 12), so this friendship has become a channel for both fellowship and compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the young goat</b><p>The goat is the agreed wage for the presumed prostitute. Ironically, goats are later specified for sin offerings (<a href="/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23&#8211;24</a>), hinting at the need for atonement Judah doesn&#8217;t yet acknowledge. The animal also recalls Jacob&#8217;s goat-skin deception (<a href="/genesis/27-9.htm">Genesis 27:9&#8211;16</a>) and the goat&#8217;s blood used to fake Joseph&#8217;s death (<a href="/genesis/37-31.htm">Genesis 37:31</a>). Layers of familial deceit echo through the narrative, emphasizing how sin&#8217;s patterns repeat until confronted by grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to collect the items</b><p>Judah had left his seal, cord, and staff (v. 18). These personal markers function like modern identification and guarantee. Scripture treats pledges seriously: <a href="/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10&#8211;13</a> guards the poor from exploitation, and <a href="/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26&#8211;27</a> warns against rash pledging. Judah&#8217;s treasured items now sit in unknown hands, symbolizing how his integrity hangs in the balance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he had left with the woman</b><p>The woman is Tamar, but Judah still sees her only as &#8220;the prostitute&#8221; (v. 21). His misperception blinds him to God&#8217;s larger plan. <a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a> reminds us, &#8220;His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He observes all his steps.&#8221; Even when humans mislabel or misunderstand, the Lord remains fully aware of every detail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he could not find her</b><p>Hirah&#8217;s fruitless search (vv. 21&#8211;22) highlights divine intervention. God protects Tamar&#8217;s identity and ensures the pledge items stay hidden until the appointed moment of exposure (v. 25). <a href="/jeremiah/23-24.htm">Jeremiah 23:24</a> asks, &#8220;Can a man hide in secret places where I cannot see him?&#8221; The answer echoes here: neither Judah&#8217;s sin nor Tamar&#8217;s righteous claim can remain concealed forever.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/38-20.htm">Genesis 38:20</a> portrays the uneasy moment when Judah attempts to cover his moral tracks. By sending a friend with payment, he hopes to retrieve compromising evidence and keep his failure private. Yet the search fails, showing that God governs even the smallest details to bring sin to light, preserve covenant purposes, and move His redemptive plan forward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Judah sent the kid</span> - literally, <span class="accented">the kid of the goats</span>, which he had promised (ver. 17) - <span class="cmt_word">by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand</span>: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> (literally, and) <span class="cmt_word">he</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Hirah) <span class="cmt_word">found her not.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/38-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now when Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
