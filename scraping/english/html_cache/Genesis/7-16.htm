The pairing of male and female ensures the continuation of each species after the floodwaters recede. This mirrors the creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God created living creatures according to their kinds. The emphasis on "every living thing" underscores the comprehensive nature of God's plan for preservation, reflecting His sovereignty over creation.<p><b>as God had commanded Noah</b><br>Noah's obedience is a central theme here, demonstrating his faith and righteousness. This obedience is consistent with <a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>, where Noah did everything just as God commanded him. It serves as a model of faithfulness and trust in God's word, even when the task seems daunting or the future uncertain. This obedience is later echoed in the New Testament, where faith is often linked with action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>Then the LORD shut him in</b><br>This phrase signifies divine protection and provision. By shutting Noah in, the LORD Himself ensures the safety and security of Noah and his family, as well as the animals. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and savior of humanity. The use of "LORD" (Yahweh) emphasizes the personal and covenantal nature of God's relationship with Noah. This divine sealing is reminiscent of the sealing of believers with the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>), ensuring their security in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to build the ark and preserve life during the flood.
