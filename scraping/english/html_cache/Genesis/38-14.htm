Tamar's widow's garments indicated her mourning and her status as a widow. By removing these garments, Tamar was symbolically stepping out of her role as a widow, which was significant given her unresolved levirate marriage situation. The levirate law, later codified in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, required a brother-in-law to marry the widow to produce offspring for the deceased brother. Tamar's actions reflect her awareness of this cultural expectation and her determination to secure her rights and future.<p><b>covered her face with a veil to disguise herself</b><br>Veiling in the ancient world could signify modesty, betrothal, or, in some contexts, prostitution. Tamar's use of a veil was strategic, allowing her to disguise her identity. This act of veiling is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for her encounter with Judah. The veil prevented Judah from recognizing her, which was crucial for her plan to succeed. This act of disguise can be seen as a form of wisdom or cunning, reminiscent of other biblical figures who used disguise for a greater purpose, such as Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<p><b>and sat at the entrance to Enaim</b><br>Enaim, meaning "eyes" or "springs," was a location on the road to Timnah. Sitting at the entrance suggests a place of visibility and encounter, where travelers would pass by. This strategic positioning indicates Tamar's intention to be noticed by Judah. The entrance to a city or town was often a place of significant social and economic activity, making it an ideal location for Tamar's plan.<p><b>which is on the way to Timnah</b><br>Timnah was a town in the territory of Judah, known for its vineyards and agriculture. The mention of Timnah situates the narrative geographically and culturally, as it was a place associated with harvest and festivity. This context of travel and festivity may have contributed to Judah's state of mind and his subsequent actions. Timnah is also mentioned in the story of Samson (Judges 14), highlighting its recurring role in biblical narratives as a place of significant events.<p><b>For she saw that although Shelah had grown up</b><br>Shelah was Judah's third son, and according to the levirate custom, he was next in line to marry Tamar. The phrase indicates that enough time had passed for Shelah to reach maturity, yet the expected marriage had not occurred. This delay highlights Judah's failure to fulfill his obligation to Tamar, which was a serious breach of social and familial duty. Tamar's awareness of Shelah's maturity underscores her understanding of her rights and the injustice she faced.<p><b>she had not been given to him as a wife</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unfulfilled promise and the injustice done to Tamar. Judah's failure to give Tamar to Shelah as a wife left her in a vulnerable position, without security or a future. This situation reflects broader themes of justice and righteousness in the Bible, where God often intervenes on behalf of the marginalized and oppressed. Tamar's actions can be seen as a pursuit of justice, aligning with biblical themes where God upholds the cause of the widow and the orphan (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The widow of Er, Judah's firstborn, who disguises herself to secure her rights and future.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, who fails to fulfill his promise to Tamar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelah.htm">Shelah</a></b><br>Judah's youngest son, whom Tamar was promised to marry after the death of his brothers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enaim.htm">Enaim</a></b><br>The location where Tamar positions herself, strategically on the way to Timnah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/timnah.htm">Timnah</a></b><br>A place associated with Judah's sheep-shearing, a significant event in the account.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_keeping_promises.htm">The Importance of Keeping Promises</a></b><br>Judah's failure to keep his promise to Tamar leads to a series of events that could have been avoided.

Similar wardrobe shifts appear when David tells the woman of Tekoa to &#8220;put on mourning clothes&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>), and widows in Israel commonly wore distinct attire to mark their status.<p>&#8226; By setting aside those clothes, Tamar declares that her claim under the levirate obligation (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>) is still valid; she is ready to marry the next brother, Shelah, as Judah had pledged (<a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Her decision confronts Judah&#8217;s failure to keep his promise, highlighting God&#8217;s concern that widows receive justice (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She covered her face with a veil to disguise herself</b><p>&#8226; Veiling could be modesty (<a href="/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>) or concealment (<a href="/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12-13</a>). Here it lets Tamar approach Judah without immediate recognition, a calculated move to secure her rightful offspring.<p>&#8226; The veil also masks her identity as Judah&#8217;s daughter-in-law, exposing the contrast between Judah&#8217;s public respectability and his private behavior. <a href="/proverbs/7-10.htm">Proverbs 7:10</a> mentions a woman &#8220;dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent,&#8221; yet Tamar&#8217;s motive is covenantal, not immoral.<p>&#8226; The veil points ahead to God&#8217;s pattern of using hidden or unexpected means&#8212;like Rahab&#8217;s rope (<a href="/joshua/2-18.htm">Joshua 2:18</a>) or Esther&#8217;s royal secrecy (<a href="/esther/2-10.htm">Esther 2:10</a>)&#8212;to preserve His promised line.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah</b><p>&#8226; Entrances or gates were centers of transaction and judgment (<a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>).

On the way to Timnah&#8212;a place connected with vineyards (<a href="/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-3</a>)&#8212;Judah is en route to shear his sheep, a festive but morally careless atmosphere similar to Nabal&#8217;s sheep-shearing feast (<a href="/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting underscores human vulnerability, yet God orchestrates events so His purposes flow even through flawed decisions (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For she saw that although Shelah had grown up, she had not been given to him as a wife</b><p>&#8226; The phrase recalls Judah&#8217;s earlier instruction: &#8220;Remain a widow&#8230;until my son Shelah grows up&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>). Years later, Shelah is of age, yet Judah withholds him, denying Tamar her covenantal right.<p>&#8226; Tamar&#8217;s perception reveals her discernment and courage, traits celebrated in virtuous women like Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9-11</a>) and the <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a> wife (<a href="/proverbs/31-25.htm">Proverbs 31:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s failure contrasts with God&#8217;s faithfulness. Though man breaks promises, the Lord&#8217;s covenant stands (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).

By laying aside widow&#8217;s garments, veiling herself, positioning at Enaim, and acting on Judah&#8217;s broken promise, she exposes human negligence while advancing the lineage that will lead to King David and ultimately to Christ. The verse reminds readers that God works through imperfect people and unexpected strategies to keep His Word sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/38.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">In an open place.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">in the gate of Enajim. </span>Enajim means "the two fountains," and we learn from <a href="/genesis/38-21.htm" title="Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side?
