His interactions with Jacob are marked by cunning and self-interest, reflecting the complex family dynamics and the theme of deception that runs through the patriarchal narratives. Laban's response here is part of a larger negotiation process, typical of ancient Near Eastern customs, where marriages were often arranged through family agreements.<p><b>Better that I give her to you than to another.</b><br>This phrase reflects the cultural practice of arranged marriages, where family alliances and the preservation of wealth and property within the family were prioritized. Laban's statement suggests a preference for keeping the marriage within the extended family, which was common in ancient times to maintain tribal and familial bonds. This also foreshadows the eventual complications in Jacob's marriages, as Laban's intentions are not entirely transparent.<p><b>Stay here with me.</b><br>Laban's invitation for Jacob to stay indicates a period of service that Jacob would render in exchange for marrying Rachel. This reflects the custom of bride service, where a prospective groom would work for the bride's family as a form of dowry. The phrase also sets the stage for the unfolding of God's providential plan, as Jacob's extended stay with Laban leads to the fulfillment of God's promises to him, despite the trials and deceptions he faces. This period of service can be seen as a time of character development for Jacob, paralleling the refining processes that believers undergo.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/laban.htm">Laban</a></b><br>Laban is the brother of Rebekah and the father of Leah and Rachel.

Thus Jacob, as the second son, had a claim upon Rachel. The Rabbins even say that Leah's eyes were weak from weeping, because Esau had not come to marry her. This absurd idea bears witness, nevertheless, to the custom of the intermarriage of cousins being an established rule, and gives a reason for Laban's acceptance of Jacob as the husband of his younger child. As Jacob offered seven years' service for Rachel, and gave a second seven years' service for her after he had been tricked into taking Leah, we may conclude that the length of time was not unreasonable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man</span>.
