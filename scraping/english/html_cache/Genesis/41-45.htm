In ancient cultures, names often held significant meaning and power. The name "Zaphenath-paneah" is believed to mean "God speaks, he lives" or "revealer of secrets," highlighting Joseph's God-given ability to interpret dreams. This act of renaming also parallels other biblical instances where individuals receive new names to signify divine purpose, such as Abram to Abraham and Jacob to Israel.<p><b>and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife</b><br>Asenath's marriage to Joseph integrates him into the Egyptian elite, as she is the daughter of Potiphera, a priest of On (Heliopolis), a major religious center dedicated to the sun god Ra. This union symbolizes Joseph's acceptance and assimilation into Egyptian culture while maintaining his Hebrew identity. The priestly connection underscores the importance of religious and political alliances in ancient Egypt. This marriage also prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant community, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt</b><br>Joseph's rise to power fulfills the dreams he had as a youth, where his family would bow to him, symbolizing his authority. His position as second-in-command to Pharaoh demonstrates God's providence and sovereignty, using Joseph to preserve many lives during the impending famine. This role as a savior of Egypt foreshadows Christ's redemptive work, where Jesus, like Joseph, is exalted to a position of authority to bring salvation.

Consider how Abram became Abraham when God established a covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>), or how Daniel and his friends received Babylonian names when they entered royal service (<a href="/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Pharaoh&#8217;s act publicly recognizes Joseph&#8217;s new status. The young Hebrew sold by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>) is now Egypt&#8217;s highest official under the king.<p>&#8226; Though the culture is pagan, God&#8217;s providence shines. What Joseph once declared in a prison&#8212;&#8220;Interpretations belong to God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>)&#8212;is now affirmed by the throne of Egypt.<p>&#8226; The change of name underscores <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>: &#8220;Exaltation does not come from the east, west, or desert, but God is the Judge; He brings down one and exalts another.&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s elevation is God&#8217;s doing, not human luck.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife</b><p>&#8226; Pharaoh further integrates Joseph into Egyptian society through marriage. Similar royal favors appear when King Saul offers his daughter to David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Asenath&#8217;s father is priest of On (Heliopolis), a center of sun-god worship. While this seems worlds apart from Joseph&#8217;s faith, Genesis later shows Joseph remaining loyal to the LORD; he names his first son Manasseh because &#8220;God has made me forget all my hardship&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-51.htm">Genesis 41:51</a>) and his second Ephraim because &#8220;God has made me fruitful&#8221; (41:52).<p>&#8226; The union foreshadows how God will later graft Gentiles into His covenant people, hinted at in the mixed multitude leaving Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>) and fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a> resounds here: &#8220;We know that God works all things together for the good of those who love Him.&#8221; Even a politically arranged marriage in a pagan land fits within God&#8217;s saving plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt</b><p>&#8226; Joseph steps into the role Pharaoh announced moments earlier: &#8220;Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>).<p>&#8226; His administrative authority recalls how he once managed Potiphar&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4-6</a>) and the prison (39:22-23). These seasons were God&#8217;s training ground, illustrating <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>: &#8220;Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By placing a man who fears God over Egypt, the Lord positions His servant to save many lives during the coming famine&#8212;both Egyptian and Israelite (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Joseph&#8217;s stewardship foreshadows Christ&#8217;s ultimate reign. Just as the nations rallied to Joseph for bread (<a href="/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>), so &#8220;all authority in heaven and on earth&#8221; is given to Jesus, who offers the Bread of Life (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a> portrays God&#8217;s sovereign elevation of Joseph from prisoner to prime minister.

By "the world," would be meant the living, as in Canon Cook's explanation, which, in the sense of "he who feeds the world," or "the living," is the best exposition yet given. There is no authority for the supposition that the name means "revealer of secrets."<p><span class= "bld">Asenath.</span>--?n Egyptian word signifying the "favourite of Neith," the Egyptian Minerva.<p><span class= "bld">Potipherah.</span>--See Note on <a href="/genesis/39-1.htm" title="And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.">Genesis 39:1</a>.<p><span class= "bld">On.</span>--This is also an Egyptian word, signifying the sun, whence in Hebrew the name of this city was Bethshemesh, <span class= "ital">house of the sun; </span>in Greek, Heliopolis; and in Latin, Oppidum Solls. It was famous for its temple of Ra, the sun, destroyed at an early period by the Persians, but still remarkable for its ruins, among which is an obelisk covered with hieroglyphics of extreme antiquity. Several of the obelisks now at Rome were brought by the emperor Caligula from this spot. It is situated about six miles north-east of Cairo.<p>A difficulty has been felt by some in a Hebrew shepherd being thus described as marrying the daughter of a priest of the sun; and also that Joseph, a worshipper of the One God, should ally himself with an idolater. But the elevation of a slave to high rank is not an uncommon occurrence in the East, especially as he might be of as good birth and education as his owner, slaves being obtained either by kidnapping, or by war. And a slave so raised to power, would not be likely to oppose his benefactor, nor would even a high priest refuse a daughter to the king's favourite, especially if, as appears to have been the case, he had first been raised to the priesthood. Joseph too, would rightly regard the whole matter as providential, and though he might not know for what exact purpose, as regards his race, he was thus exalted, there was noble work for him to do in saving Egypt from perishing by famine. The narrative throughout represents him as remaining true to the religion of his family (<a href="/context/genesis/41-51.htm" title="And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.">Genesis 41:51-52</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-18.htm" title="And Joseph said to them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God:">Genesis 42:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/43-29.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me?

We must remember, however, that their worship had not degenerated as yet into the miserable idolatry of later times, and that the Egyptian creed contained much primaeval truth, though in a corrupted form. Pharaoh himself, in <a href="/context/genesis/41-38.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?">Genesis 41:38-39</a>, speaks as one that acknowledged a supreme God, and Joseph throughout freely used to him the name of Elohim.
