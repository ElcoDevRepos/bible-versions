This moment is significant as it marks a turning point where Jacob stands up for himself. The cultural context of the time allowed for family disputes to be settled through direct confrontation, often in the presence of witnesses. Jacob's challenge to Laban is not just personal but also a defense of his integrity and God's blessing upon him, as seen in previous chapters where God promised to be with Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;What is my crime?&#8221; he said.</b><br>Jacob's question implies a legal inquiry, as if he were on trial. In ancient Near Eastern culture, accusations required evidence, and Jacob is demanding Laban to present any wrongdoing. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which requires two or three witnesses to establish a matter. Jacob's rhetorical question underscores his confidence in his innocence.<p><b>&#8220;For what sin of mine have you so hotly pursued me?</b><br>The term "hotly pursued" suggests an intense and relentless pursuit, akin to a military chase. This phrase highlights the severity of Laban's actions, which can be seen as an overreaction, given the familial relationship. The pursuit mirrors other biblical narratives where God's people are pursued by adversaries, such as Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8-9</a>). Jacob's use of "sin" indicates a moral and spiritual dimension, emphasizing that he has not transgressed against Laban. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also pursued and accused without cause (<a href="/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

The alternation of heat and cold in many eastern countries is very great and severely felt by shepherds, travelers, and watchmen, who require to pass the night in the open air, and who in consequence are often obliged to wear clothes lined with skins (cf. <a href="/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-30.htm">Jeremiah 36:30</a>). "The thermometer at 24&deg; Fahr. at night, a lump of solid ice in our basins in the morning, and then the scorching heat of the day drawing up the moisture, made the neighborhood, convenient as it was, rather a fever-trap, and premonitory symptoms warned us to move" (Tristram, 'The Land of Moab,' p. 217). "The night air at Joaiza was keen and cold; indeed there was a sharp frost, and ice appeared on all the little pools about the camp" (Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' p. 364). "Does a master reprove his servant for being idle; he will ask, "What can I do? the heat eats me up by day, and the cold eats me up by night'" (Roberts 'Oriental Illustrations,' p. 37; cf. Paxton's 'Illustrations,' vol. 1. p. 30). <span class="cmt_word">And my sleep departed from mine eyes.</span> Syrian shepherds were compelled to watch their flocks often both night and day, and for a whole month together, and repair into long plains and deserts without any shelter; and when reduced to this incessant labor, they were besides chilled by the piercing cold of the morning, and scorched by the succeeding heats of a flaming sun, the opposite action of which often swells and chafes their lips and face" (Paxton's 'Illustrations of Scripture,' vol. 1. p. 30). Thus have I been - literally, <span class="accented">this to me</span> (or for myself, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>- twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle.</span> The majority of expositors understand the twenty years referred to in ver. 38 to be the same as the twenty spoken of here as consisting of fourteen and six. Dr. Kennicott, regarding the twenty years of ver. 38 as having intervened between the fourteen and the six of ver. 41, makes the entire period of Jacob's sojourn in Padan-aram to have been forty years. In support of this he contends - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, twice repeated (in ver. 38 and in ver. 41), may be legitimately rendered, "This (one) twenty years I was with thee" (ver. 38), i.e. taking care of thy flocks; and "this for myself (another) twenty years in thy house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. serving for thy daughters and thy cattle (cf. <a href="/exodus/14-20.htm">Exodus 14:20</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/job/21-23.htm">Job 21:23, 25</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that on this hypothesis more time is afforded for the birth of Jacob's family, viz. twenty-seven years instead of seven; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it relieves the narrative of certain grave chronological difficulties in connection with Judah and his family, which, on the supposition of the shorter period, subsequently emerge, such as that Judah and his sons must have been quite children when they married (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1-11</a>). But, on the other hand, in favor of the accepted chronology it may be urged - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the interposition of a second twenty years in the middle of the first is unnatural; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, though legitimate, the proposed rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> does not at first sight suggest itself as that which Jacob intended; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it is not impossible for Jacob's family to have been born in the short space of seven years (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/genesis/27-1.htm">Genesis 27:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/30-35.htm">Genesis 30:35</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that in reality the difficulties connected with Judah and his sons are not removed by the hypothesis of a forty years' sojourn in Padan-aram any more than by a sojourn of only twenty years, since Judah must have married either after the sale of Joseph, in which case only twenty-two years remain for the birth and marriage of Er and Onan, for Pharez and Zarah, Judah's children by Tamar, to grow to manhood, and for Pharez to have two sons, Hezron and Hamul, before descending to Egypt, unless indeed, as Kurtz supposes, Judah's grandchildren were born in Egypt; or before the sale of Joseph - indeed, if Hezron and Hamul were born in Canaan, before the birth of Joseph, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. while Judah was yet in Padan-aram, which is contrary to the narrative (<span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1, 2</a>). For these reasons, though adopted by some excellent authorities (Bishop Horsley, Adam Clarke, 'Speaker's Commentary,' Inglis), the computation of Dr. Kennicott does not appear of sufficient weight to set aside the ordinary reckoning, which is followed by interpreters of equal credit (Keil, Kalisch, Kurtz, Lange, Murphy, Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">And thou hast changed my wages ten times</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Except</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, if not, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unless, introducing the protasis of the sentence) t<span class="cmt_word">he God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac,</span> - <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the object of Isaac's fear, not "terror" (Oort and Kuenen, <span class="accented">vide</span> 'The Bible for Young People,' vol. 1. p. 243), viz.

The entire clause is a periphrasis for Jehovah of ver. 3, which is usually ascribed to the Jehovist, while the present verse belongs, it is alleged, to the fundamental document - <span class="cmt_word">had been with</span> - or, for (cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/psalms/124-1.htm">Psalm 124:1, 2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">me</span> (during the whole period of my sojurn in Padan-aram, but especially during the last six years), <span class="cmt_word">surely</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, then, commencing the apodosis) <span class="cmt_word">thou hadst sent me away now empty</span> (as by thy stratagem in changing my wages thou didst design;
