The term "slaughter" refers to the massacre carried out by Simeon and Levi, which was a response to the defilement of their sister, Dinah. This act of violence reflects the intense familial loyalty and the cultural importance of honor and retribution in ancient Near Eastern societies. The involvement of the other sons suggests a collective family response, highlighting the unity and shared values within Jacob's family, despite the moral and ethical implications of their actions.<p><b>and looted the city</b><br>Looting the city signifies the complete devastation and plundering of Shechem by Jacob's sons. This act of taking spoils was common in ancient warfare, where victors would claim the possessions of the defeated. The looting underscores the totality of the retribution and the extent of the sons' anger and desire for justice, albeit through violent means. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the cycle of violence, as seen in other scriptural accounts such as the conquest narratives in Joshua.<p><b>because their sister had been defiled</b><br>The defilement of Dinah is the catalyst for the events in this chapter. In the cultural and historical context of the time, the violation of a woman was not only a personal affront but also a dishonor to her family and community. This phrase highlights the gravity of Dinah's situation and the perceived need for her brothers to restore family honor. The narrative emphasizes the importance of purity and the severe repercussions of sexual immorality, themes that resonate throughout the Bible. The defilement and subsequent actions also foreshadow the complex dynamics of justice, mercy, and redemption that are central to biblical theology.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob's_sons.htm">Jacob's Sons</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob, particularly Simeon and Levi, are central figures in this account.
