This act of setting up a pillar is reminiscent of Jacob's earlier experience at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>), where he also set up a stone as a pillar after his dream of the ladder reaching to heaven. The pillar serves as a physical reminder of God's presence and promises. In biblical history, pillars often symbolize a place of worship or a memorial to a divine encounter, emphasizing the importance of remembering God's faithfulness and revelations.<p><b>a stone marker</b><br>The use of a stone marker is consistent with ancient practices of erecting stones as memorials. Stones were durable and visible, serving as lasting reminders of significant events. In the biblical narrative, stone markers often signify covenantal moments or divine interventions. For example, Joshua set up twelve stones in the Jordan River as a memorial of Israel's crossing into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>). The stone marker here signifies the sacredness of the location where God communicated with Jacob, reinforcing the idea of a tangible connection between the divine and human realms.<p><b>and he poured out a drink offering on it</b><br>The pouring of a drink offering is an act of worship and dedication. Drink offerings, typically consisting of wine, were part of the sacrificial system in Israelite worship (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40-41</a>). This act symbolizes the pouring out of one's life in devotion to God, reflecting a heart of gratitude and commitment. The drink offering is also seen in the New Testament, where Paul refers to his life being poured out as a drink offering (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>), indicating a life fully surrendered to God's service. This connection highlights the continuity of worship practices and the theme of sacrificial devotion throughout Scripture.<p><b>and anointed it with oil</b><br>Anointing with oil is a significant biblical practice, symbolizing consecration and the setting apart of something or someone for a holy purpose. In the Old Testament, oil was used to anoint priests, kings, and sacred objects, marking them as dedicated to God (<a href="/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25-30</a>). The anointing of the pillar by Jacob signifies the sanctity of the place and the divine encounter that occurred there. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, whose title means "Anointed One." The use of oil in anointing also points to the presence and work of the Holy Spirit, who anoints believers for service and empowers them for God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is central to this passage.

Each action&#8212;setting up, marking, pouring, anointing&#8212;declares God&#8217;s faithfulness and Jacob&#8217;s yielded heart.
