Their departure is an act of trust in that directive, echoing earlier journeys of faith such as Abraham&#8217;s in <a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>.<p>&#8226; By moving forward at the Lord&#8217;s word, the family places itself squarely under the covenant promise first given in <a href="/genesis/28-15.htm">Genesis 28:15</a>&#8212;&#8220;I will watch over you wherever you go.&#8221; The step of faith invites the shield of God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A terror from God</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights a dread sent directly by the LORD, not mere rumor or coincidence.

God guards His people not only by visible intervention but by touching the unseen realm of the heart (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The covenant promise to Abraham&#8212;&#8220;I am your shield&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>)&#8212;finds a tangible fulfillment here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fell over the surrounding cities</b><p>&#8226; The dread is wide-ranging, blanketing neighboring towns beyond Shechem.
