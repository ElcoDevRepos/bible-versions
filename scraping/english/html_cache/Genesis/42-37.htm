His actions and words here reflect his attempt to regain favor with his father after previous failures, such as his sin with Bilhah (<a href="/genesis/35-22.htm">Genesis 35:22</a>). This moment highlights the tension and desperation within the family as they face the famine and the demand from the Egyptian ruler (Joseph, unbeknownst to them) to bring Benjamin to Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you.</b><br>Reuben's offer is a hyperbolic expression of his commitment and desperation. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, such vows were not uncommon, though they were not always intended to be taken literally. This reflects the gravity of the situation and Reuben's earnestness to assure Jacob of his sincerity. The mention of his sons underscores the seriousness of his pledge, as children were considered a man's legacy and future.<p><b>Put him in my care,</b><br>Reuben is asking for trust and responsibility, seeking to reassure Jacob by offering himself as a guarantor for Benjamin's safety. This plea for trust is significant given Reuben's past actions, and it shows his desire to restore his standing within the family. The concept of guardianship and responsibility is a recurring theme in the Bible, often reflecting God's care for His people.<p><b>and I will return him.&#8221;</b><br>Reuben's promise to return Benjamin is a direct response to Jacob's fear of losing another beloved son, as he had lost Joseph. This assurance is crucial in the narrative, as it sets the stage for the brothers' eventual journey to Egypt and the unfolding of God's providential plan. The theme of return and restoration is echoed throughout Scripture, pointing to God's redemptive work and the ultimate return of His people to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The eldest son of Jacob, who offers his own sons as collateral to ensure the safe return of Benjamin from Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, who is hesitant to send his youngest son, Benjamin, to Egypt after losing Joseph.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jacob, whom the brothers need to take to Egypt to prove their honesty to Joseph, who is now a powerful official there.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the brother who has risen to power in Egypt and is testing his brothers' integrity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph has become a ruler and where the brothers must go to buy grain during the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_responsibility.htm">The Weight of Responsibility</a></b><br>Reuben's offer highlights the gravity of taking responsibility for others, especially family members.

He regarded the risk as so slight that he was willing to stake the lives of two of his children, perhaps all he then had, upon Benjamin's safe return. To take such a proposal as meant literally is irrational. But it was but feeble talk, in agreement with the general weakness of Reuben's character.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/42.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Reuben spake unto his father, saying</span> (Reuben was probably actuated by an ardent brotherly affection, which prompted him to endeavor to recover Simeon, as formerly he had sought to deliver Joseph), <span class="cmt_word">Slay my two sons</span> - as Reuben had four sons (<a href="/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>), he first be understood as meaning two of my sons (Ainsworth, Murphy), either the two then present (Junius) or the two oldest (Mercerus) - <span class="cmt_word">if I bring him</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Benjamin) <span class="cmt_word">not to thee.</span> Reuben's proposal, though in one sense "the greatest and dearest offer that a son could make to a father" (Keil), was either only a sample of strong rhetoric (like Joseph's "By the life of Pharaoh!") designed to assure his father of the impossibility of failure (Lawson, Candlish, Inglis), and of the fact that neither he nor his brethren entertained any injurious designs against Benjamin (Calvin); or, if seriously made, was not only inconsiderate and rash, spoken in the heat of the moment (Kurtz), but sinful and unnatural (Ainsworth), <span class="accented">plusquam barbarura</span> (Calvin), and absolutely worthless besides, as what consolation would it be to Jacob to add to the loss of a son the murder of his grandchildren? (Calvin, Willet). <span class="cmt_word">Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again</span>. Reuben might have learned to avoid strong asseverations on this point. "It was his wish to bring Joseph home to his father, and yet he could not persuade his brethren to comply with his intentions.
