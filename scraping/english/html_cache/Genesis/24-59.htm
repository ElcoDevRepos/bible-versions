The act of sending her on her way reflects the cultural practices of arranged marriages in ancient Near Eastern societies, where family consent and blessing were crucial. Rebekah's departure signifies her transition from her father's household to her husband's, a common practice in patriarchal societies. This moment also highlights the fulfillment of God's providence, as Rebekah's journey is part of the divine plan to continue Abraham's lineage through Isaac.<p><b>along with her nurse</b><br>The inclusion of Rebekah's nurse indicates the importance of companionship and support for women during travel and transition in ancient times. Nurses often played significant roles in the upbringing and care of children, and their presence was a sign of status and wealth. This detail underscores the care and provision Rebekah's family ensured for her, reflecting the value placed on her well-being as she embarked on her new life.<p><b>and Abraham&#8217;s servant</b><br>Abraham's servant, identified earlier in the chapter as Eliezer, plays a crucial role in this narrative. His mission to find a wife for Isaac is a testament to his loyalty and faithfulness to Abraham. The servant's journey and actions are guided by prayer and divine intervention, illustrating the theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. The servant's presence in this phrase emphasizes the successful completion of his mission and the continuation of God's covenant with Abraham.<p><b>and his men</b><br>The mention of "his men" indicates that the servant did not travel alone, but with a retinue, which was customary for long journeys in ancient times for protection and assistance. This detail highlights the wealth and status of Abraham, as well as the importance of the task at hand. The presence of these men also ensures the safe passage of Rebekah and her nurse, underscoring the seriousness and significance of the marriage arrangement.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>A key figure in the Genesis account, Rebekah is the daughter of Bethuel and the sister of Laban.
