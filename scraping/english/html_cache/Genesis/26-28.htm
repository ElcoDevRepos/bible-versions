In the biblical context, God's presence often manifests in prosperity and protection, as seen in Isaac's successful endeavors (<a href="/genesis/26-12.htm">Genesis 26:12-14</a>). This mirrors God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>, where blessings and divine presence are assured. The recognition by outsiders underscores the testimony of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His covenant promises.<p><b>they replied.</b><br>The response from Abimelech and his officials indicates a shift in their relationship with Isaac. Previously, there was tension and conflict over water rights (<a href="/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15-22</a>). Their reply signifies a move towards reconciliation and peace, acknowledging Isaac's strength and God's evident blessing upon him.<p><b>We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you.</b><br>The proposal for an oath reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of formalizing agreements to ensure peace and mutual respect. Oaths were serious commitments, often invoking divine witnesses to guarantee the terms. This reflects a desire for a stable and peaceful coexistence, recognizing the potential for conflict if left unaddressed.<p><b>Let us make a covenant with you</b><br>Covenants in the biblical narrative are binding agreements that establish relationships and obligations between parties. This request for a covenant echoes earlier biblical covenants, such as those between God and Noah (Genesis 9) and God and Abraham (Genesis 15, 17). It signifies a formal and solemn agreement, aiming to secure peace and cooperation. In a broader theological sense, covenants foreshadow the ultimate covenant through Jesus Christ, who establishes peace between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is the central figure in this chapter.

We gather, however, that the king did not use any generic or heathen names of the Deity, but that whereby the patriarchs worshipped their covenant God, and his so doing was probably intended as an act of homage to Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said, We saw certainly</span> - literally, <span class="accented">seeing we saw</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. we assuredly perceived, or, we have indeed discovered (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ewald's 'Hebrews Synt.,' &sect; 312).

Neither is it necessary to suppose that the term Jehovah is a Mosaic translation of the epithet employed by Abimelech (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The long-continued residence of Abraham in Gemr and Beersheba afforded ample opportunity for Abimelech becoming acquainted with the patriarch's God. The introduction of Jehovah into the narrative may be noted as a third point of dissimilarity between this and the previous account - <span class="cmt_word">and we said, Let there he now an oath</span> - i.e. a treaty secured by an oath or self-imprecation on the transgressor (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-41.htm">Genesis 24:41</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 13</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee</span>, - a farther particularization of the parties to the covenant for the sake of emphasis - <span class="cmt_word">and let us make a covenant with thee</span>.
