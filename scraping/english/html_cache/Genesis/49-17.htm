The imagery of a snake suggests cunning and subtlety. In biblical context, snakes often symbolize deceit or danger, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> with the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The road implies a place of travel or transition, indicating that Dan's influence or actions may occur in unexpected or vulnerable moments. Historically, the tribe of Dan settled in a region that was a crossroads for trade and travel, which could have made them strategically significant.<p><b>a viper in the path</b><br>The viper is a more specific and dangerous type of snake, emphasizing the potential harm or threat posed by Dan. In ancient Near Eastern culture, vipers were feared for their venomous bite, symbolizing lethal and sudden danger. This imagery suggests that Dan's actions could be unexpectedly harmful or treacherous. The path indicates a journey or direction, possibly alluding to the spiritual or moral journey of Israel, where Dan's influence might lead to pitfalls or challenges.<p><b>that bites the horse&#8217;s heels</b><br>The act of biting the horse's heels is a metaphor for causing disruption or downfall. Horses were symbols of strength and power in ancient times, often used in warfare and transportation. By targeting the heels, the viper (Dan) causes the horse to stumble, representing a strategic attack on the foundation or support of something strong. This could symbolize how Dan's actions might undermine or destabilize larger entities or plans within Israel.<p><b>so that its rider tumbles backward</b><br>The result of the horse being bitten is the rider's fall, indicating a loss of control or defeat. In biblical symbolism, the rider could represent leadership or authority, suggesting that Dan's actions might lead to the downfall of leaders or the disruption of established order. This imagery can be connected to the broader narrative of Israel's history, where internal strife and external threats often led to periods of instability. The prophecy here may also foreshadow future events where the tribe of Dan plays a role in significant upheavals or challenges within the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, who is giving his final blessings and prophecies to his sons in <a href="/bsb/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dan.htm">Dan</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, representing one of the tribes of Israel.

Now he adds an image of a serpent lingering beside the roadway. The tribe of Dan would never possess a vast territory like Judah or Ephraim, yet its influence would be felt.<p>&#8226; A snake works from ground level, quietly positioned where an unguarded foot will pass. Dan, stationed on Israel&#8217;s northern frontier (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>), often acted from the edges rather than the center.<p>&#8226; The tribe later migrated northward and seized Laish by stealth (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27-29</a>), showing the same unobtrusive approach hinted at here.<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/10-25.htm">Numbers 10:25</a> records Dan marching last whenever Israel moved camp, guarding the rear&#8212;again, a strategic place to strike if danger approached the column.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A viper in the path</b><p>The image intensifies: not just any snake, but a venomous viper fixed where victims must travel.<p>&#8226; Dan&#8217;s most famous son, Samson, struck the Philistines with sudden, lethal blows (<a href="/bsb/judges/13.htm">Judges 13</a> &#8211; 16). Like a viper, he attacked unexpectedly&#8212;burning fields (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4-5</a>) or toppling pillars (<a href="/judges/16-29.htm">Judges 16:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-22.htm">Deuteronomy 33:22</a> pictures Dan as a pouncing lion&#8217;s cub, another stealth hunter. Both lion and viper convey the same idea: decisive, surprise offense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That bites the horse&#8217;s heels</b><p>Horses in ancient warfare gave speed and height to an enemy. Targeting the heel unseats the rider without confronting his strength head-on.<p>&#8226; Samson crippled Philistine power by undermining their economy and morale rather than fielding an army (<a href="/judges/15-3.htm">Judges 15:3-8</a>).<p>&#8226; In later history, Jeroboam stationed a golden calf in Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29-30</a>). While sinful, it demonstrates the tribe&#8217;s ongoing ability to redirect national movement&#8212;this time, tragically, away from Jerusalem.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that its rider tumbles backward</b><p>The ultimate effect of Dan&#8217;s strike is reversal for the foe. God would use this tribe&#8217;s guerrilla-style tactics to topple enemies larger than itself.<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a> shows Dan settling securely after routing the peaceful people of Laish, while their victims were left defenseless.<p>&#8226; Samson&#8217;s final act crushed more Philistines in his death than in his life (<a href="/judges/16-30.htm">Judges 16:30</a>), sending the &#8220;rider&#8221; crashing down even as the &#8220;viper&#8221; expired.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/49-17.htm">Genesis 49:17</a> foresees the tribe of Dan operating from the margins with sharp, sudden force. Like a roadside viper, Dan would protect Israel by surprise attacks that cripple stronger opponents, causing them to fall back in disarray. History confirms this prophecy through Dan&#8217;s rear-guard position in the wilderness, its stealthy conquest of Laish, and the exploits of Samson. God&#8217;s word proves true: even a small tribe, obedient or disobedient, fulfills His precise purposes in the unfolding plan of redemption.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/49-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1835.htm">Strong's 1835: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dan -- 'judge', a son of Jacob, also a place in Northern Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Jussive - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a serpent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5175.htm">Strong's 5175: </a> </span><span class="str2">A serpent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the road,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;e&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a viper</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1465;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#183;p&#772;&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8207.htm">Strong's 8207: </a> </span><span class="str2">A kind of serpent, the cerastes, horned adder</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the path,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1425;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_734.htm">Strong's 734: </a> </span><span class="str2">A well-trodden road, a caravan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that bites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
