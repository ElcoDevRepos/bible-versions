At ninety-nine, he was well beyond the typical age for fathering children, emphasizing the divine intervention required for the fulfillment of God's promise to make him a father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4-5</a>). This age also underscores Abraham's long journey of faith, having left Haran at seventy-five (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>). His advanced age serves as a testament to his enduring faith and patience, waiting on God's timing.<p><b>when he was circumcised</b><br>Circumcision was instituted by God as a sign of the covenant between Him and Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-11</a>). This act was a physical mark of the spiritual covenant, symbolizing purity and separation unto God. It was a significant act of obedience for Abraham, aligning with the biblical theme of faith being demonstrated through action (<a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21-24</a>). Circumcision also prefigures the New Testament concept of the circumcision of the heart, a spiritual transformation through faith in Christ (<a href="/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>). This act at such an advanced age further illustrates Abraham's commitment to God's commands, regardless of personal cost or societal norms.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>Originally named Abram, he is the central figure in this passage.
