The trembling signifies a mix of fear, anger, and realization of the gravity of the situation. In the cultural context, blessings were considered irrevocable and carried significant weight, often seen as divinely guided. Isaac's trembling may also reflect his awareness of God's sovereignty in the unfolding events, despite human deception.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me?</b><br>Isaac's question reveals his confusion and the unexpected nature of the deception. Hunting was a skill highly valued in the ancient Near East, and Esau, known for his hunting prowess, was expected to fulfill this role. The question underscores the betrayal by Jacob, who impersonated Esau to receive the blessing. This moment highlights the theme of identity and deception, which recurs throughout Genesis.<p><b>Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him</b><br>Isaac's statement confirms the completion of the blessing ritual, which involved a meal symbolizing fellowship and covenant. The act of eating together was significant in ancient cultures, often sealing agreements or covenants. The irrevocability of the blessing once given is emphasized here, reflecting the belief that spoken words, especially blessings, held power and could not be undone.<p><b>and indeed, he will be blessed!&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase acknowledges the effectiveness and permanence of the blessing, despite the deception. It reflects the belief in the divine authority behind the patriarchal blessings, suggesting that God's purposes prevail even through human actions. This moment foreshadows the unfolding of God's covenant promises through Jacob, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises, as seen in the lineage leading to Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and father of Esau and Jacob.
