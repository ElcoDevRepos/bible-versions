Judah, who once suggested selling Joseph into slavery, now offers himself as a slave. This marks a significant transformation in his character, highlighting themes of repentance and redemption. The willingness to become a servant echoes the biblical principle of servanthood seen in Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>as my lord&#8217;s slave</b><br>Judah refers to Joseph as "my lord," acknowledging Joseph's authority and position in Egypt. This reflects the fulfillment of Joseph's earlier dreams (<a href="/genesis/37-7.htm">Genesis 37:7-9</a>), where his brothers would bow to him. The concept of slavery here is significant, as it was a common practice in ancient Egypt, often involving those who were in debt or captured in war. Judah's offer to become a slave underscores his commitment to his family and his willingness to bear the consequences for Benjamin's sake.<p><b>in place of the boy</b><br>Judah's offer to take Benjamin's place is a powerful act of substitutionary sacrifice, prefiguring the ultimate substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ for humanity's sins. This act of stepping in for another is a recurring biblical theme, seen in the sacrificial system of the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's sacrifice on the cross (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<p><b>Let him return with his brothers</b><br>Judah's concern for Benjamin's return to their father Jacob highlights the importance of family unity and the fulfillment of promises. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant faithfulness to His people. The return of Benjamin with his brothers also ensures the preservation of the family line, which is crucial for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through the lineage of Israel, ultimately leading to the birth of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, Judah steps forward to offer himself as a substitute for his brother Benjamin.
