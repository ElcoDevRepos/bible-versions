Rebekah's beauty may symbolize her suitability for God's plan, reflecting the divine favor upon her. Beauty in the Bible can also foreshadow significant roles in God's redemptive history, as seen in Esther and others.<p><b>a virgin who had not had relations with any man</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Rebekah's purity and eligibility for marriage, aligning with cultural expectations of the time. Virginity was highly valued in ancient Near Eastern societies, often associated with honor and covenantal faithfulness. This detail underscores her suitability as Isaac's wife, ensuring the purity of the Abrahamic line.<p><b>She went down to the spring</b><br>The act of going to the spring highlights the daily life and responsibilities of women in ancient Mesopotamia. Springs were central to community life, serving as gathering places. This setting provides a natural backdrop for divine encounters, as seen in other biblical narratives like those of Hagar and the Samaritan woman.<p><b>filled her jar</b><br>Rebekah's action demonstrates her industriousness and hospitality, qualities esteemed in biblical womanhood. Her willingness to serve foreshadows her role in the unfolding of God's covenant promises. This act of drawing water also prefigures the living water motif found in the New Testament, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and life.<p><b>and came up again</b><br>This phrase indicates Rebekah's strength and capability, as drawing water was physically demanding. Her return from the spring sets the stage for her encounter with Abraham's servant, a pivotal moment in the narrative. This action signifies the completion of her task and readiness for the divine appointment that follows, echoing themes of divine providence and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The young woman described in this verse, known for her beauty and purity.

In the culture of Abraham&#8217;s household, virginity safeguarded lineage integrity and covenant promises (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Virginity also prefigures spiritual fidelity. Paul speaks of presenting believers &#8220;as a chaste virgin to Christ&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), linking physical purity with covenant loyalty.<p>&#8226; Such purity qualified her for the sacred role of matriarch in the promised line through which Messiah would come (<a href="/matthew/1-2.htm">Matthew 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By stating this detail, the narrative affirms that God&#8217;s unfolding plan is accomplished through lives marked by holiness (<a href="/leviticus/20-7.htm">Leviticus 20:7&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again</b><p>&#8226; Rebekah performs an ordinary chore with energy and humility. Springs sat below ground level, so &#8220;went down&#8221; indicates effort; &#8220;came up again&#8221; shows readiness to serve others (<a href="/genesis/24-18.htm">Genesis 24:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Everyday faithfulness frequently sets the stage for divine appointments&#8212;compare Ruth gathering grain in <a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a> or the Samaritan woman meeting Jesus at a well in <a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7</a>.<p>&#8226; The detail that she &#8220;filled her jar&#8221; points to preparedness. Like the wise virgins with extra oil (<a href="/matthew/25-4.htm">Matthew 25:4</a>), Rebekah&#8217;s readiness will soon bless Abraham&#8217;s servant and, by extension, the covenant family.<p>&#8226; <a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> encourages working &#8220;with all your heart, as working for the Lord.&#8221; Rebekah embodies that principle long before Paul writes it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16</a> highlights three complementary traits in Rebekah: external beauty, moral purity, and diligent service. Together they display God&#8217;s gracious provision for Isaac, demonstrate His concern for both character and competence, and remind us that ordinary obedience can become the conduit for extraordinary blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">She went down to the well.</span>--The water, therefore, was reached by a flight of steps, the usual rule wherever the well was fed by a natural spring. Cisterns, on the contrary, supplied from the rains were narrower at the top than at the bottom.<p>Mr. Malan (<span class= "ital">Philosophy or Truth, </span>p. 93), in an interesting account of his visit to this well, says that on going out from Haran in the evening to examine it, he found "a group of women filling, no longer their pitchers, since the steps down which Rebekah went to fetch the water are now blocked up, but their water-skins by drawing water at the well's mouth. Everything around that well bears signs of age and of the wear of time; for as it is the only well of drinkable water there, it is much resorted to. Other wells are only for watering the flocks. There we find the troughs of various height for camels, for sheep and for goats, for kids and for lambs; there the women wear nose-rings and bracelets on their arms, some of gold or of silver, and others of brass, or even of glass."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the damsel was very fair to look upon</span>.
