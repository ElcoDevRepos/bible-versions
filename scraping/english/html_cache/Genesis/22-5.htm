The donkey, a common beast of burden, symbolizes the everyday responsibilities that must be set aside when approaching a divine encounter. This separation underscores the seriousness of the mission and the need for focus and dedication. In biblical times, donkeys were essential for travel and carrying goods, indicating the journey's practical aspects.<p><b>Abraham told his servants.</b><br>Abraham's communication with his servants reflects his leadership and the trust he places in them. Servants in the ancient Near East were often considered part of the household, and their loyalty was crucial. This moment also emphasizes Abraham's role as a patriarch, responsible for guiding and instructing those under his care. The presence of servants suggests the wealth and status of Abraham, as well as the communal nature of his household.<p><b>The boy and I will go over there to worship,</b><br>The term "boy" refers to Isaac, who is likely a young man at this point, indicating a close father-son relationship. The act of going "over there" suggests a deliberate movement towards a specific place chosen for worship, which in this context is Mount Moriah. Worship here involves sacrifice, a common practice in ancient religions, signifying devotion and obedience to God. This phrase foreshadows the test of faith that Abraham will face, as well as the ultimate sacrifice that God will provide.<p><b>and then we will return to you.</b><br>Abraham's statement of returning with Isaac is a profound expression of faith. Despite knowing God's command to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham believes in God's promise that Isaac will be the heir through whom God's covenant will be fulfilled. This reflects a deep trust in God's provision and foreshadows the resurrection theme, as Abraham anticipates that both he and Isaac will come back. This belief is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>, where it is suggested that Abraham reasoned God could raise the dead, pointing to a typology of Christ's resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.

The bestowal of Isaac had been so extraordinary, that Abraham would not feel staggered at what otherwise would have seemed incredible. Apparently, therefore, he meant Isaac by <span class= "ital">the lamb, </span>thus showing that it was not he who chose the victim, but God. The few words that passed between father and son, the notice by the latter that amid such careful preparation no victim had been provided, the father's answer that that matter was left to God, the resolute faith of the one, and the trusting submission of the other, as "they went both of them together," form a picture full not merely of interest, but even of tragical pathos.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye</span> (for similar forms of expression cf. <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>;
