Run there quickly,</b><br>This phrase reflects the urgency of the situation. The angels are instructing Lot to escape immediately to avoid the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The urgency underscores the severity of God's judgment and the necessity of swift obedience. This mirrors other biblical instances where immediate action is required, such as the Israelites' hasty departure from Egypt during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>).<p><b>for I cannot do anything until you reach it.&#8221;</b><br>This statement highlights God's mercy and protection over Lot and his family. It shows that divine judgment is withheld until the righteous are safe, reflecting God's justice and compassion. This principle is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the story of Noah, where the flood did not begin until Noah and his family were secure in the ark (<a href="/genesis/7-16.htm">Genesis 7:16</a>). It also foreshadows the concept of divine protection for believers, as seen in the New Testament with the promise of deliverance from God's wrath (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>).<p><b>That is why the town was called Zoar.</b><br>Zoar, meaning "small" or "insignificant," was originally named Bela (<a href="/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>). Its renaming signifies its role as a place of refuge for Lot. Geographically, Zoar was located near the Dead Sea, and its survival amidst the destruction of the surrounding cities highlights God's provision. The preservation of Zoar can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides refuge and salvation for believers. The sparing of Zoar also serves as a reminder of God's ability to preserve a remnant, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, living in Sodom, who is being urged by angels to flee the impending destruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Messengers of God sent to rescue Lot and his family from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zoar.htm">Zoar</a></b><br>A small town near Sodom where Lot and his family are instructed to flee for safety.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Cities known for their wickedness, destined for destruction by God&#8217;s judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God&#8217;s Judgment</a></b><br>The divine decision to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah due to their sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/urgency_of_obedience.htm">Urgency of Obedience</a></b><br>The angels&#8217; command to "hurry" underscores the importance of immediate obedience to God&#8217;s instructions.

The angels press Lot to act without delay, just as they had earlier: &#8220;When dawn came, the angels hurried Lot, saying, &#8216;Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters&#8230;&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a>). Throughout Scripture, delay in the face of judgment is dangerous (<a href="/exodus/12-33.htm">Exodus 12:33</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>). God&#8217;s warnings are merciful, but they are not indefinite. Like Noah entering the ark before the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>), Lot must move now because the time of safety is swiftly closing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Run there quickly,</b><p>Flight, not negotiation, is the proper response to sin&#8217;s impending judgment. The angels had already said, &#8220;Escape for your life!&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-17.htm">Genesis 19:17</a>). Similarly, believers are urged to &#8220;flee from idolatry&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>) and to &#8220;pursue righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>). Lot&#8217;s refuge is small but sufficient, echoing <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a> where we &#8220;flee for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.&#8221; God always provides a definite place of safety, and obedience means moving toward it without wavering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For I cannot do anything until you reach it</b><p>This statement highlights both God&#8217;s justice and His covenant faithfulness. Judgment on Sodom is certain (<a href="/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20&#8211;21</a>), yet it is withheld until Lot, the righteous man God has pledged to rescue (<a href="/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>), is secure. The pattern appears again in <a href="/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a> where destruction is delayed &#8220;until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.&#8221; God&#8217;s wrath never falls on the righteous with the wicked (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>), underscoring His impeccable timing and His mercy toward those counted as His own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is why the town was called Zoar.</b><p>Lot had pleaded, &#8220;Is it not a small town? &#8230; let me flee there&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20</a>). Zoar&#8217;s name reminds readers that even &#8220;small&#8221; graces are large in God&#8217;s redemptive plan. What seems insignificant becomes a monument to divine deliverance, much like Gideon&#8217;s small army securing victory (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>) or the &#8220;day of small things&#8221; that God does not despise (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>). The naming records God&#8217;s faithfulness so future generations remember that rescue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a> reveals the heart of God toward His own: urgent warning, clear direction, protective restraint, and memorable rescue.
