The name "Israel" signifies his role as the patriarch of the twelve tribes. His impending death marks a significant transition in the narrative of the Israelites. The awareness of his mortality prompts him to make arrangements for his burial, reflecting the importance of burial customs in ancient Near Eastern culture.<p><b>he called his son Joseph</b><br>Joseph, the favored son of Jacob, holds a position of power in Egypt as second only to Pharaoh. Jacob's summoning of Joseph highlights the special relationship between them and Joseph's ability to fulfill his father's wishes due to his authority. This also underscores the theme of family unity and the continuation of God's covenant through Joseph's line.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;If I have found favor in your eyes</b><br>This phrase is a formal request, showing humility and respect. It reflects the cultural norms of the time, where seeking favor was a way to ensure cooperation and goodwill. The phrase is reminiscent of similar requests made by biblical figures seeking assurance or assistance, such as Ruth with Boaz.<p><b>put your hand under my thigh</b><br>This gesture was a customary oath-taking practice in the ancient Near East, symbolizing a solemn promise. It is also seen in <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2-3</a> when Abraham makes his servant swear an oath. The act signifies the seriousness of the commitment being made, often related to matters of great importance, such as family lineage and covenant promises.<p><b>and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness</b><br>The terms "kindness" and "faithfulness" are covenantal language, often associated with God's steadfast love and loyalty. Jacob is asking Joseph to act in accordance with these divine attributes, ensuring that his burial wishes are honored. This reflects the broader biblical theme of covenant loyalty and the expectation of mutual faithfulness among God's people.<p><b>Do not bury me in Egypt</b><br>Jacob's request not to be buried in Egypt emphasizes his desire to be laid to rest in the Promised Land, Canaan, where his ancestors were buried. This reflects the patriarchal hope in God's promises regarding the land. It also foreshadows the eventual exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, highlighting the temporary nature of their sojourn there and their ultimate return to the land God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, originally named Jacob, who is nearing the end of his life and making final arrangements with his son Joseph.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's beloved son, who rose to power in Egypt and is entrusted with fulfilling his father's burial wishes.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Jacob and his family have settled during the famine, but not the land of promise given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promise_and_oath.htm">Promise and Oath</a></b><br>The cultural practice of placing a hand under the thigh as a solemn oath, signifying a serious commitment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burial_request.htm">Burial Request</a></b><br>Jacob's desire to be buried in Canaan, the land promised to his descendants, reflecting his faith in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Jacob's request to be buried in Canaan reflects his unwavering faith in God's covenant promises.

The passage highlights covenant continuity, filial honor, and a forward-looking trust that God will fulfill every promise.

Placed at the entrance of Egypt, on the side of Arabia and Palestine, the clans of his sons would daily grow in number by the addition of Semitic immigrants, by whose aid they would make the vast and fertile region assigned them, and which had previously had but a scanty population, a well-cultivated and thriving land. But at last Jacob feels his end approaching, though apparently he was not as yet in immediate danger of death. But there was a wish over which he had long pondered; and desiring to have his mind set at rest, he sends for Joseph, and makes him promise that he will bury him in the cave at Machpelah. We find him again charging all his sons to grant him this request (<a href="/context/genesis/49-29.htm" title="And he charged them, and said to them, I am to be gathered to my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,">Genesis 49:29-32</a>); nor need we seek for any remote reason for it. Jacob's whole nature was a loving one, and strongly influenced by home and domestic feelings; and at Machpelah his nearest relatives were buried. In the next chapter he dwells upon Rachel's death, and his burial of her apart from the rest at Ephrath; and this seems to have increased his grief at her loss. At Machpelah, Abraham. whom he had known as a boy, his beloved father and mother, and Leah, who had evidently at last won his affections, all lay; and there, naturally, he too wished to lie among his own.<p><span class= "bld">Put </span>. . . <span class= "bld">thy hand under my thigh.</span>--See Note on <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm" title="And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:">Genesis 24:2</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/47.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the time drew nigh that Israel</span> (i.e. Jacob) <span class="cmt_word">must die</span> (literally, and <span class="accented">the days of Israel to die drew near</span>): <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight</span> (not as if Jacob doubted Joseph's affection, but simply as desiring a last token of his love, perhaps also as unconsciously recognizing his son's greatness), <span class="cmt_word">put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh</span>, - an ancient form of adjuration (cf. <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt.</span> On the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to bury (cf.
