It reflects the ongoing divine guidance and intervention in Jacob's life, as seen in previous encounters such as the dream at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12-15</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Though your name is Jacob</b><br>The name Jacob means "supplanter" or "heel-grabber," reflecting his earlier life characterized by struggle and deception, such as when he took Esau's birthright and blessing (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34, 27</a>:1-29). This acknowledgment of his current name sets the stage for a transformation in identity and purpose.<p><b>you will no longer be called Jacob</b><br>This signifies a divine transformation and a new beginning. The change of name represents a shift in character and destiny, moving away from his past actions and towards his role as the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. It is a common biblical motif where a name change signifies a new mission or covenant, as seen with Abram to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>).<p><b>Instead, your name will be Israel</b><br>The name Israel means "God prevails" or "he struggles with God," referencing Jacob's wrestling with the angel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>). This new name signifies his perseverance and the divine favor upon him, marking him as the progenitor of a nation chosen by God. It also foreshadows the struggles and triumphs of the nation of Israel.<p><b>So God named him Israel</b><br>This act of naming by God underscores His sovereignty and the establishment of Jacob's new identity and role. It confirms the covenant promises made to Abraham and Isaac, now being passed to Jacob. This renaming is a pivotal moment in biblical history, as it sets the foundation for the nation of Israel, through whom God's redemptive plan unfolds, ultimately leading to the coming of Jesus Christ, a descendant of Israel (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Originally named Jacob, meaning "supplanter" or "heel-grabber" in Hebrew, he is the son of Isaac and Rebekah and the twin brother of Esau.
