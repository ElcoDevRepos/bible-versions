The imagery of the thin cows devouring the fat cows without changing in appearance symbolizes the coming years of famine that will consume the years of plenty. This reflects the principle that spiritual or physical famine can erase the memory of abundance, a theme seen in other biblical narratives such as the Israelites forgetting God's provision in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The inability to discern the consumption also highlights the deceptive nature of sin and spiritual decay, which can consume without immediate visible effects.<p><b>their appearance was as ugly as it had been before.</b><br>The unchanged ugliness of the cows after consuming the healthy ones underscores the severity and persistence of the famine. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for the enduring nature of sin and its consequences, which are not easily remedied by superficial solutions. The ugliness can also be seen as a representation of spiritual desolation, akin to the descriptions of spiritual barrenness in passages like <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, where human righteousness is compared to "filthy rags."<p><b>Then I awoke.</b><br>Pharaoh's awakening signifies the transition from the dream state to reality, prompting the need for interpretation and action. This moment of awakening can be paralleled with spiritual awakening or enlightenment, where one becomes aware of divine truths or impending judgment, similar to the call to spiritual vigilance found in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>). The urgency of Pharaoh's awakening reflects the need for immediate response to divine revelation, a theme echoed in the urgency of repentance and faith in the gospel message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt who had troubling dreams that none of his magicians or wise men could interpret.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A Hebrew man, sold into slavery, who was known for his ability to interpret dreams through God's guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The setting of the account, a powerful ancient civilization where Joseph rose to prominence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dream.htm">The Dream</a></b><br>Pharaoh's dream involved seven ugly and gaunt cows devouring seven sleek and fat cows, yet remaining as ugly as before.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/interpretation.htm">Interpretation</a></b><br>Joseph interprets the dream as a prophecy of seven years of abundance followed by seven years of severe famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_revelation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Revelation</a></b><br>God reveals His plans to those who seek Him and are faithful, as seen in Joseph's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_preparation.htm">Wisdom in Preparation</a></b><br>Just as Joseph advised Pharaoh to prepare for the coming famine, we should be wise stewards of our resources, preparing for both physical and spiritual needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>Joseph's rise to power was in God's perfect timing, reminding us to trust in His timing for our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_earthly_appearances.htm">The Futility of Earthly Appearances</a></b><br>The unchanged appearance of the cows after devouring the others symbolizes how earthly gains can be fleeting and unsatisfying without God's blessing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Joseph remained faithful to God despite his circumstances, encouraging us to remain steadfast in our faith during trials.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_41_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 41:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_21_Ignoring_God_s_warnings.htm">How does Genesis 41:21 illustrate the consequences of ignoring God's warnings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_provision_in_Gen_41_21.htm">What can we learn about God's provision from Genesis 41:21's imagery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_21_link_to_Genesis_37_dreams.htm">How does Genesis 41:21 connect with Joseph's earlier dreams in Genesis 37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_21_s_lesson_for_finances.htm">How can we apply the lessons of Genesis 41:21 to modern financial planning?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_21_Spiritual_readiness.htm">What does Genesis 41:21 teach about the importance of spiritual preparedness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Genesis_41_21_Divine_providence.htm">How does Genesis 41:21 illustrate the concept of divine providence in Joseph's story?

The picture is literal within the dream yet symbolic in meaning:<p>&#8226; In Joseph&#8217;s interpretation, the fat cows stand for seven literal years of abundance, while the thin cows are seven literal years of famine that will &#8220;consume the land&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26-30</a>).<p>&#8226; Famine often follows plenty in Scripture; compare Elijah&#8217;s day when rain stopped after fruitful harvests (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1-7</a>).<p>&#8226; God alone reveals and rules over future events (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>), using dreams&#8212;as He did with Joseph earlier (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>) and with Daniel before Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one could tell that they had done so</b><p>Even after swallowing the healthy cows, the gaunt cows look no different&#8212;still as empty as ever.<p>&#8226; Famine not only consumes abundance; it leaves no visible benefit behind.

Like Jacob who &#8220;awoke from his sleep&#8221; and knew &#8220;Surely the LORD is in this place&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/28-16.htm">Genesis 28:16</a>), Pharaoh senses something weighty.<p>&#8226; God often gives revelation at night and then calls for action by day (<a href="/job/33-14.htm">Job 33:14-16</a>). Pharaoh&#8217;s response&#8212;summoning wise men and finally Joseph&#8212;shows that divine insight demands prompt obedience (<a href="/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/41-21.htm">Genesis 41:21</a> shows famine&#8217;s consuming power: it devours abundance, leaves no trace of benefit, and remains just as dreadful. God disclosed this reality to Pharaoh through a literal dream so he&#8212;and all Egypt&#8212;might prepare. The verse reminds us that prosperity apart from God is fragile, but humble obedience to His revealed word turns warning into provision (<a href="/genesis/41-33.htm">Genesis 41:33-36</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18-19</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/41-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they had devoured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
