His summoning of Abram indicates a serious breach of trust and a significant diplomatic incident. In the ancient Near East, such summoning would have been a formal and possibly intimidating event. This moment highlights the tension between God's chosen people and the surrounding nations, a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It also foreshadows future interactions between Israel and Egypt, such as the Exodus.<p><b>&#8220;What have you done to me?</b><br>Pharaoh's question underscores the gravity of Abram's deception. In the ancient world, actions that brought plagues or misfortune were often attributed to divine displeasure. Pharaoh's question reflects his understanding that Abram's actions have brought divine judgment upon his household. This incident prefigures the plagues that will later afflict Egypt during the time of Moses, showing a pattern of God's intervention in protecting His covenant people.<p><b>Why didn&#8217;t you tell me she was your wife?</b><br>This question reveals the cultural norms and expectations regarding marriage and truthfulness. In ancient societies, marriage was a sacred institution, and deception regarding marital status could lead to severe consequences. Abram's failure to disclose Sarai's true identity endangered both her and Pharaoh, as taking another man's wife was considered a grave sin. This situation highlights the moral and ethical challenges faced by God's people in a fallen world. It also points to the importance of truthfulness and integrity, themes that are echoed throughout Scripture, such as in the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, who unknowingly took Sarai, Abram's wife, into his household, believing her to be Abram's sister.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is the patriarch called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.
