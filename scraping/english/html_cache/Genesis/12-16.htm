In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was common for rulers to bestow gifts to secure alliances or favor. This reflects the cultural practice of forming alliances through marriage or kinship ties. The favor shown to Abram foreshadows the future blessings and prosperity promised by God, despite Abram's deception.<p><b>and Abram acquired sheep and cattle</b><br>Sheep and cattle were valuable assets in the ancient world, symbolizing wealth and status. This acquisition signifies an increase in Abram's wealth, aligning with God's promise to bless him. The mention of livestock also connects to the pastoral lifestyle of the patriarchs, emphasizing their role as shepherds and caretakers, a theme that recurs throughout the Bible.<p><b>male and female donkeys</b><br>Donkeys were essential for transportation and agricultural work, indicating Abram's growing resources and ability to sustain a large household. The inclusion of both male and female donkeys suggests the potential for breeding and further increase in wealth. This detail highlights the practical aspects of God's blessings, providing for Abram's immediate and future needs.<p><b>menservants and maidservants</b><br>The acquisition of servants reflects the social hierarchy and economic structures of the time. Servants were integral to managing large households and estates. This increase in human resources underscores Abram's rising status and influence. It also foreshadows the later narrative of the Israelites in Egypt, where they will become a great nation, initially as servants.<p><b>and camels</b><br>Camels were rare and valuable in Abram's time, often associated with trade and long-distance travel. Their mention here indicates Abram's expanding capacity for trade and mobility, essential for his nomadic lifestyle. This detail also points to the broader narrative of God's provision, equipping Abram for the journey and mission ahead.

The presents here show that Pharaoh fully believed that he was acting lawfully, while the largeness of them proves that Sarai, in spite of her years, was looked upon as a valuable acquisition. Among the presents are "asses." The charge on this account brought against the author of "inaccuracy," as if asses were not known at this time in Egypt, is disproved by the occurrence of representations of this animal on the tombs of Benihassan: we have proof even that they were numerous as far back as when the Pyramids of Gizeh were built. The horse is not mentioned, and the earliest representation of one is in the war-chariot of Ahmes, the first: Pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty, who expelled the Hyksos. Male and female slaves are, curiously enough, introduced between "he-asses" and "she-asses." As she-asses were especially valuable, perhaps these and the camels were looked upon as the monarch's choicest gifts.<p>Camels are not represented on the monuments, and are said not to thrive well in Egypt; but the Semitic hordes who were peopling the Delta would certainly bring camels with them. Many, too, of the Egyptian monarchs--as, for instance, those of the twelfth dynasty--held rule over a great part of the Sinaitic peninsula, and must have known the value of the camel for transporting heavy burdens in the desert, and its usefulness to a nomad sheik like Abram. (See <a href="/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he entreated Abram well</span> - literally, <span class="accented">did good to Abram</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (LXX., Hieronymus, Poole) supposes that the court of Pharaoh or the Egyptian people generally conferred favors on the patriarch, which is not at all so probable as that Pharaoh did - <span class="cmt_word">for her sake.</span> Marriage negotiations in Oriental countries are usually accompanied by presents to the relatives of the de as a sort of payment.
