The maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, and their children are placed at the front. This arrangement reflects the social hierarchy and familial dynamics of the time, where maidservants and their offspring held a lower status compared to the wives and their children. This positioning may also indicate Jacob's protective instincts, as he places those he perceives as less vulnerable or less favored in the more exposed position. This act can be seen as a strategic move, possibly to gauge Esau's reaction before exposing his more beloved family members.<p><b>Leah and her children next</b><br>Leah, Jacob's first wife, and her children are placed in the middle. Leah bore Jacob six sons and a daughter, making her a significant figure in the lineage of the tribes of Israel. The placement of Leah and her children reflects their intermediate status within the family hierarchy. Leah's position in the lineup may also symbolize her complex relationship with Jacob, who loved Rachel more. This arrangement highlights the ongoing family dynamics and tensions that have been present since Jacob's marriages to Leah and Rachel, as seen in earlier chapters of Genesis.<p><b>and Rachel and Joseph at the rear</b><br>Rachel, Jacob's favored wife, and her son Joseph are placed at the rear, indicating their special status in Jacob's eyes. Rachel's position at the back suggests Jacob's desire to protect her and Joseph, whom he loved deeply. Joseph's later prominence in the biblical narrative, as seen in his rise to power in Egypt, is foreshadowed by his placement here. This arrangement underscores the theme of favoritism that runs throughout Jacob's family story, which later contributes to the jealousy and conflict among his sons. Rachel's position also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's providence and the unfolding of His plan through the chosen line, which ultimately leads to the coming of Jesus Christ, a descendant of Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarch who is returning to meet his brother Esau after many years.

Her sons&#8212;Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun&#8212;stand behind the maidservant group, showing they rank higher in Jacob&#8217;s affections.<p>&#8211; This placement reflects the ongoing tension between Leah&#8217;s longing for Jacob&#8217;s love and Jacob&#8217;s selective devotion (<a href="/genesis/30-17.htm">Genesis 30:17-20</a>).<p>&#8211; Even so, God honors Leah by giving her Judah, the tribe through whom the Messiah will come (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8-10</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-3</a>). Jacob&#8217;s lineup unintentionally highlights that divine purposes often run counter to human favoritism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rachel and Joseph at the rear</b><p>&#8211; Rachel is the wife Jacob loved from the start (<a href="/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18-20</a>). Keeping her and Joseph last is Jacob&#8217;s way of shielding what he treasures most.<p>&#8211; Joseph, the firstborn of Rachel, would later receive the ornate robe and his father&#8217;s special attention (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>). The seed of family conflict already appears in this protective positioning.<p>&#8211; Jacob&#8217;s ordering also hints at prophecy: Joseph, once kept safe at the back, will one day be elevated to the front in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41-43</a>). God often takes what is treasured and uses it to preserve many lives (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/33-2.htm">Genesis 33:2</a> records more than a travel arrangement; it exposes Jacob&#8217;s heart, his fears, and the layered complexity of a family built outside God&#8217;s original design for marriage. By arranging the line from least-loved to most-loved, Jacob tries to shield Rachel and Joseph while still moving forward to meet Esau. The verse therefore teaches:<p>&#8226; Sinful favoritism always leaves a trail, yet God remains sovereign over the family&#8217;s future.<p>&#8226; Divine purposes weave through human imperfections&#8212;Daniel, Naphtali, Judah, and Joseph will each play pivotal roles in Israel&#8217;s story.<p>&#8226; Trust in God, not in human strategy, is the ultimate safety, for only His providence protects every member of the covenant family (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/33-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
