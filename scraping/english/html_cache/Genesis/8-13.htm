Noah's age is significant, as it connects to the genealogies in Genesis, which trace the lineage from Adam to Abraham. The longevity of antediluvian patriarchs is a notable feature of the early Genesis narrative, reflecting a different era in human history. This timeframe also highlights God's faithfulness in preserving Noah and his family through the flood.<p><b>on the first day of the first month</b><br>The timing here is significant, as it marks a new beginning, symbolizing renewal and hope. The first month in the Hebrew calendar, Nisan, later becomes associated with the Passover, a time of deliverance for the Israelites from Egypt. This connection underscores themes of salvation and new beginnings, which are central to the biblical narrative.<p><b>the waters had dried up from the earth</b><br>This phrase indicates the completion of God's judgment through the flood and the restoration of the earth. The drying of the waters parallels the creation account, where God separates the waters to create dry land. It signifies a new creation and a fresh start for humanity. Theologically, it points to God's sovereignty over creation and His ability to renew and restore.<p><b>So Noah removed the covering from the ark</b><br>Noah's action of removing the covering signifies an act of faith and obedience. It demonstrates his trust in God's promise that the earth would be habitable again. The ark itself is a type of Christ, providing salvation and refuge from judgment. Noah's removal of the covering can be seen as a precursor to the unveiling of God's salvation plan through Jesus Christ.<p><b>and saw that the surface of the ground was dry</b><br>This observation confirms God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to Noah. The dry ground represents a new beginning for humanity, echoing the creation narrative where God brings order out of chaos. It also foreshadows the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea and the Jordan River on dry ground, further illustrating God's deliverance and provision for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/noah.htm">Noah</a></b><br>A righteous man chosen by God to survive the flood and repopulate the earth.
