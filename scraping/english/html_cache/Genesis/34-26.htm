The context is the defilement of their sister Dinah by Shechem, which led to a deceitful agreement involving circumcision. The use of swords indicates a premeditated and personal act of vengeance, reflecting the ancient Near Eastern practice of blood revenge. This act of violence is significant in the narrative of Genesis, as it demonstrates the intense familial loyalty and the severe consequences of violating family honor. The killing of Hamor and Shechem also foreshadows the later tribal conflicts in Israel's history.<p><b>took Dinah out of Shechem&#8217;s house</b><br>Dinah's removal from Shechem's house signifies her liberation from captivity and the restoration of her honor. In the cultural context of the time, a woman's association with a man's household implied a form of possession or control, especially after an incident like Dinah's. This act by her brothers underscores the importance of family honor and the protection of female relatives in ancient Israelite society. It also highlights the patriarchal structure where male family members were responsible for the welfare and status of their female kin.<p><b>and went away</b><br>The departure of Simeon and Levi with Dinah marks the conclusion of their act of vengeance and the beginning of the consequences that would follow. This phrase suggests a retreat from the scene of violence, possibly to avoid immediate retaliation. It also indicates a return to their father Jacob, who later rebukes them for their actions, fearing repercussions from the surrounding Canaanite tribes. This event sets the stage for future tensions within Jacob's family and among the tribes of Israel, illustrating the complex interplay of justice, revenge, and divine providence in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hamor.htm">Hamor</a></b><br>The father of Shechem, a Hivite prince.

Simeon and Levi, Dinah&#8217;s full brothers (<a href="/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>), personally carry out the execution, showing how deeply family honor has been violated.<p>&#8226; Their swords indicate deliberate, face-to-face justice rather than a distant or accidental death (compare <a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture presents the act as literal history, yet later condemns the brothers&#8217; uncontrolled wrath: &#8220;Simeon and Levi are brothers&#8212;their swords are weapons of violence&#8230; Cursed be their anger&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law will later forbid personal vengeance (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and reserve retribution for Himself (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). <a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a> thus records the act without approving their excesses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They took Dinah out of Shechem&#8217;s house</b><p>&#8226;

Family responsibility is underscored. Just as Abraham rescued Lot (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14-16</a>), Simeon and Levi feel compelled to reclaim their sister.<p>&#8226; Yet their method foreshadows future tragedies when zeal outruns righteousness, as with Absalom&#8217;s revenge for Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went away</b><p>&#8226; The brothers depart swiftly, leaving the city devastated (<a href="/genesis/34-27.htm">Genesis 34:27-29</a>).
