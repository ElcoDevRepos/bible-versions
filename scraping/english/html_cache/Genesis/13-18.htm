In the nomadic culture of the ancient Near East, moving one's tent was a common practice, reflecting a lifestyle dependent on God's guidance and provision. Abram's journey is a physical manifestation of his spiritual journey, trusting in God's direction.<p><b>and went to live near the Oaks of Mamre</b><br>The Oaks of Mamre, located near Hebron, were significant landmarks in the ancient world.

This location becomes a recurring site of divine encounters and covenants.<p><b>at Hebron</b><br>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the world, with archaeological evidence of its ancient origins. It becomes a significant city in biblical history, later serving as King David's first capital. Hebron's name means "association" or "fellowship," highlighting the covenant relationship between God and Abram. It is also a burial site for the patriarchs, emphasizing its lasting importance.<p><b>where he built an altar to the LORD</b><br>Building an altar was an act of worship and dedication, signifying Abram's commitment to God. Altars were central to worship in the ancient world, serving as places for sacrifice and communication with the divine. This act reflects Abram's acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and his gratitude for God's promises. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the covenant promises made to Abram.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, known for his faith and obedience to God.
