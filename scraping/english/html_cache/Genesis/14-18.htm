His name means "king of righteousness," and he is identified as the king of Salem, which is traditionally associated with Jerusalem. This connection to Jerusalem is significant, as it later becomes the central city of worship for the Israelites. Melchizedek's dual role as both king and priest is unique and prefigures the later combination of these roles in Jesus Christ, who is both King and High Priest.<p><b>brought out bread and wine&#8212;</b><br>The offering of bread and wine by Melchizedek is symbolic and has been interpreted as a precursor to the Christian Eucharist, where bread and wine represent the body and blood of Christ. This act of hospitality and blessing is significant in the context of ancient Near Eastern customs, where sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and covenant. The use of bread and wine also connects to later biblical themes, such as the Passover meal and the Last Supper.<p><b>since he was priest of God Most High&#8212;</b><br>Melchizedek is described as a priest of "God Most High," a title that emphasizes the universal sovereignty of God. This title, El Elyon in Hebrew, suggests a recognition of God's supreme authority over all creation, not limited to the God of Israel alone. Melchizedek's priesthood is unique because it predates the Levitical priesthood established through Aaron. The New Testament book of Hebrews (Hebrews 7) elaborates on Melchizedek's priesthood as a type of Christ's eternal priesthood, emphasizing that Jesus, like Melchizedek, is a priest forever, not by lineage but by divine appointment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/melchizedek.htm">Melchizedek</a></b><br>A mysterious figure who is both a king and a priest.

But such traditions are of little value, and we may eel certain that the place was really Jerusalem (<a href="/psalms/76-2.htm" title="In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.">Psalm 76:2</a>); for it lay on Abram's route homeward, and was within a reasonable distance of Sodom, which, as we have seen, lay in the Ciccar of Jericho, at the northern end of the Dead Sea. Salem is a common name for towns in Palestine (Conder, <span class= "ital">Tent-work, </span>i. 91), and the village in Ephraim is too remote to have been the place of meeting.<p>In Melchizedek we have a type of Christ (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm" title="The LORD has sworn, and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-10.htm" title="Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:10</a>; <a href="/context/hebrews/7-1.htm" title="For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;">Hebrews 7:1-21</a>), and so venerable is his character and aspect that Jewish tradition identified him with the patriarch Shem, thus reconciling also to themselves his superiority over their forefather Abraham.

Not a titular designation, like Augustus, Pharaoh, or Malek-ol-adel (<span class="accented">rexjustus</span>) of the Mohammedan kings (Cajetan), but the name of a person; neither an angel (Origen), nor the Holy Ghost (Hieracas), nor some great Divine power (the Melchisedecians), all of which interpretations are baseless conjectures; nor Christ (Ambrose), which is contrary to <a href="/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>; Norghem (Targums, Lyre, Willet, Luther, Ainsworth), which <a href="/hebrews/7-3.htm">Hebrews 7:3</a> sufficiently negatives; but most probably a Canaanitish prince by whom the true faith was retained amid the gloom of surrounding heathenism (Josephus, Irenaeus, Eusebius, Calvin, A Lapide, Delitzsch, Keil, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Candlish, Bush), though it has been suggested that "the enlightenment of the king of Salem was but a ray of the sun of Abram's faith" (Kalisch), an opinion difficult to harmonize with <a href="/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">King of Salem</span> = "king of peace (<a href="/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1</a>). The capital of Melchisedeck was either Jerusalem, of which the ancient name was Salem, as in <a href="/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> (Josephus, Onkelos, Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Knobel, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Murphy, Bush); or a city on the other side Jordan en <span class="accented">route</span> from Damascus to Sodom (Ewald); or, though less likely, as being too remote from Sodom and the king's dale, Salem in the tribe of Ephraim, a city near Scythopolis, where the ruins of Melchisedeck's palace were said to exist (Jerome), and near to which John baptized (Bochart). <span class="cmt_word">Brought forth bread and wine.</span> As a refreshment to the patriarch and his soldiers (Josephus, Calvin, Clarke, Rosenm&uuml;ller), which, however, was the less necessary since the spoils of the conquered foe were in possession of Abram and his men (Kalisch); hence mainly as a symbol, not of his transference of the soil of Canaan to the patriarch, bread and wine being the chief productions of the ground (Lightfoot), or of his gratitude to Abram, who had recovered for the land peace, freedom, and prosperity (Delitzsch), or of the institution of the Supper by the Lord Jesus Christ (Bush); but of the priestly benediction which followed and of the spiritual refreshment which it conferred upon the soul of Abram (Kalisch, Murphy). The Romish idea, that the act of Melchisedeck was sacrificial, is precluded by the statement that he brought forth the bread and wine before the people, and not before God. <span class="cmt_word">And he was the priest</span>. <span class="accented">Cohen</span>; one who undertakes another's cause, hence one who acts as mediator between God and man, though the primary signification of the root is doubtful and disputed. The necessity for this office has its ground in the sinfulness of man, which disqualifies him for direct intercourse with a holy Being (cf. Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship,' ch. 1. b.). The occurrence of this term, here mentioned for the flint time, implies the existence of a regularly-constituted form of worship by means of priests and sacrifice. Hence the Mosaic cultus afterwards instituted may only have been a resuscitation and further development of what had existed from the beginning. <span class="cmt_word">Of the most high God.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">El-Ellen</span>, a proper name for the Supreme Deity (occurring only here, in the narrative of Abram's interview with the kings); of which the first term, <span class="accented">El</span>, from the same root as Elohim (<a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, q.v.), signifies the Strong One, and is seldom applied to God without some qualifying attribute or cognomen, as El-Shaddai, or El, the God of Israel; and the second, '<span class="accented">Elion</span> (occurring frequently afterwards, as in <a href="/numbers/24-16.htm">Numbers 24:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>; Psalm 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; Psalms 9:2), describes God as the High, the Highest, the Exalted, the Supreme, and is sometimes used in conjunction with Jehovah (Psalm. 7:18 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 7:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), and with Elohim (Psalm 57:3 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 57:2<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>), while sometimes it stands alone (Psalm 21:8 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Psalm 21:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). Most probably the designation here describes the name under which the Supreme Deity was worshipped by Melchisedeck and the king of Sodom, whom Abram recognizes as followers of the true God by identifying, as in Ver. 22, El-Elion with Jehovah (cf.
