The context is the reunion of Jacob and Joseph in Egypt, a significant moment in the narrative of Genesis. Jacob's statement underscores the theme of divine providence and restoration. The loss of Joseph was a pivotal event in Jacob's life, leading to years of mourning. This moment of reunion is a testament to God's faithfulness and the unexpected ways He fulfills His promises. The phrase also highlights the human element of surprise and joy in God's plans, which often exceed human expectations.<p><b>Israel said to Joseph,</b><br>The use of the name "Israel" instead of "Jacob" is significant. It emphasizes Jacob's role as the patriarch of the Israelite nation, linking this personal family moment to the broader narrative of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This covenantal context is crucial, as it frames the events of Genesis within God's redemptive plan for His people. Joseph, as a key figure in this plan, is instrumental in preserving the family line during the famine, which ultimately leads to the growth of the Israelites in Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;but now God has let me see your children as well.&#8221;</b><br>This statement acknowledges God's sovereignty and grace. Jacob recognizes that it is by God's will that he not only sees Joseph again but also meets his grandchildren, Ephraim and Manasseh. This moment is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the stage for the blessing of Joseph's sons, who will become tribes of Israel. The mention of "children" connects to the theme of generational blessing and the continuation of God's promises through the descendants of the patriarchs. This also foreshadows the future multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham of numerous descendants. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ, where the unexpected and gracious acts of God bring about salvation and blessing beyond human comprehension.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, father of Joseph, and grandfather to Ephraim and Manasseh.

It also echoes the joy of the prodigal&#8217;s return, where &#8220;this son of mine was dead and is alive again&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-24.htm">Luke 15:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often portrays restored face-to-face fellowship as a foretaste of God&#8217;s ultimate promise: &#8220;They will see His face&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Israel said to Joseph</b><p>Moses uses Jacob&#8217;s covenant name, Israel, to underscore that this isn&#8217;t merely a touching family moment&#8212;it&#8217;s a covenant moment.<p>&#8226;

The contrast between &#8220;never expected&#8221; and &#8220;but now God&#8221; spotlights a theme repeated throughout Scripture: &#8220;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible&#8221;

<a href="/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob sees in Ephraim and Manasseh the unfolding of God&#8217;s covenant promise to multiply his offspring &#8220;like a community of nations&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This grace mirrors Job&#8217;s later restoration, where he lived to see four generations (<a href="/job/42-16.htm">Job 42:16</a>).<p>&#8226;

The patriarch, now speaking as Israel, marvels that the Lord not only restored his beloved son but expanded the blessing to a new generation.
