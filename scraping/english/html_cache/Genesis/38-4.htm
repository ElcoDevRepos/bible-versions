The repetition of conception and birth highlights the importance of offspring in biblical narratives, especially in the context of the Abrahamic covenant, where descendants are a sign of God's blessing. The birth of multiple sons to Judah is significant for the unfolding of Israel's history, as Judah's line eventually leads to King David and, ultimately, to Jesus Christ, fulfilling messianic prophecies.<p><b>and she named him Onan</b><br>The act of naming by the mother suggests her role and influence in the family, which is notable in a patriarchal society. Onan's name is significant in the narrative of <a href="/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, as he becomes a central figure in the story of levirate marriage and its obligations. Onan's actions later in the chapter have theological implications, as they reflect disobedience to God's commands and the importance of preserving family lineage. This narrative also foreshadows the concept of redemption and the importance of fulfilling one's duty, themes that are later fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity through His obedience and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The wife of Judah's son Er, who later becomes the mother of Onan's brother.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve sons of Jacob, who is the father of Er, Onan, and Shelah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/onan.htm">Onan</a></b><br>The second son of Judah and Shua's daughter, who plays a significant role in the events that follow.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shua's_daughter.htm">Shua's Daughter</a></b><br>The unnamed wife of Judah, who is the mother of Er, Onan, and Shelah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The region where these events take place, significant in the broader account of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_family_duty.htm">Understanding Family Duty</a></b><br>The account of Onan highlights the importance of family responsibilities and the cultural expectations of the time.
