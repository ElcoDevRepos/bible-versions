This practice was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where a wife could give her maidservant to her husband to bear children on her behalf. This reflects the cultural norms and family dynamics of the time, as seen in <a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3-8</a>. The sons born to Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali, who became heads of two of the tribes of Israel, highlighting the importance of each son in the formation of the nation of Israel.<p><b>whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel</b><br>Laban, Rachel's father, was a key figure in Jacob's life, as Jacob worked for him for many years to marry Rachel. The giving of Bilhah to Rachel as a maidservant was part of the dowry or bridal gift, a common practice in ancient times. This reflects the familial and social structures of the time, where servants were often part of marriage arrangements. Laban's actions also set the stage for the complex family dynamics that would follow.<p><b>seven in all</b><br>This phrase refers to the total number of descendants from Bilhah, including her sons and their offspring, who went with Jacob to Egypt. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous. This also foreshadows the growth of the Israelites in Egypt, leading to their eventual exodus and establishment as a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bilhah.htm">Bilhah</a></b><br>Bilhah was Rachel's maidservant, given to her by her father Laban.

Scripture continually rehearses the family tree so we remember God&#8217;s covenant promises moving from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-10.htm">Genesis 35:10-12</a>).<p>- Calling them &#8220;sons of Jacob&#8221; reminds us that every name in the list is part of the nation God later calls &#8220;Israel&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1-5</a>).<p>- It also spotlights God&#8217;s faithfulness: although Jacob&#8217;s household began as just one man fleeing from Esau, the family has now become a sizable clan ready to enter Egypt (<a href="/genesis/32-10.htm">Genesis 32:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>born to Bilhah</b><p>- Bilhah was Rachel&#8217;s maidservant. When Rachel struggled with infertility, she gave Bilhah to Jacob so that she might &#8220;build a family through her&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3-8</a>).<p>- Bilhah&#8217;s sons&#8212;Dan and Naphtali&#8212;are full sons in Jacob&#8217;s household. Adoption-like surrogacy was socially accepted, and Scripture records it without apology (<a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1-4</a> with Hagar and Sarah).<p>- God includes these children in the covenant line, showing His grace isn&#8217;t limited by cultural complexities or secondary status (<a href="/genesis/49-16.htm">Genesis 49:16-21</a>, where Dan and Naphtali each receive patriarchal blessings).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel</b><p>- This phrase traces Bilhah&#8217;s presence in Jacob&#8217;s family back to Laban&#8217;s household (<a href="/genesis/29-24.htm">Genesis 29:24, 29</a>).<p>- It reminds us of the tangled family relationships created by Laban&#8217;s deception&#8212;first giving Leah, then Rachel, and with them their maidservants. Even through human scheming, God keeps steering events toward His redemptive plan (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>- The mention of Laban underscores that God can use even an unbelieving relative&#8217;s actions to accomplish His purposes for His people (<a href="/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>seven in all</b><p>- The tally includes Dan and Naphtali plus their sons: Hushim, Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem (<a href="/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23-24</a>). Two fathers + five sons = seven &#8220;souls.&#8221;<p>- Moses repeats similar totals for the other mothers (<a href="/genesis/46-15.htm">Genesis 46:15, 18, 22</a>), providing a careful census as the family moves to Egypt. The accuracy underscores the historical reliability of the narrative.<p>- The number shows how small the clan still is; yet from these few God will raise a nation that &#8220;cannot be counted&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/46-25.htm">Genesis 46:25</a> is more than a headcount. It highlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness by tracing specific names, honors children born through a maidservant, shows divine providence in complicated family dynamics, and preserves an exact record of the budding nation. From seven individuals descended through Bilhah, God is building the larger tapestry of Israel, proving again that every life in His plan counts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/46.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">All the souls were seven.</span>--Made up of Dan and one son, and Naphtali and four sons.<p>Excepting Benjamin, the other genealogies do not offer any great difficulties; for variations in the spelling of names are too common to cause surprise, and names would be omitted whenever in later times the family had ceased to have a representative. Thus, probably, no member of the tribe of Dan returned from the Captivity with an authenticated genealogy, and therefore no mention of them is made in the book of Chronicles. The utter confusion in the genealogy of Benjamin is the natural result of the ruinous war narrated in Judges 20, 21; but when that tribe produced a king, the utmost care would be taken to remedy, as far as possible, the destruction of documents caused by that struggle; and the genealogy in 1 Chronicles 8 is the royal pedigree of King Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/46-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">These</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1434;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Jacob</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1511;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;q&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
