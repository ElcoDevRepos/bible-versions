According to <a href="/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4</a>, Adam and Eve had other sons and daughters, suggesting that Cain married one of his sisters or a close relative. This was necessary in the early generations of humanity to fulfill God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). The absence of genetic defects in the early human gene pool would have made such unions viable.<p><b>and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch.</b><br>The name Enoch means "dedicated" or "initiated." This birth marks the continuation of Cain's lineage despite his sin and exile. It reflects the ongoing fulfillment of God's command to populate the earth. Enoch's birth also signifies the beginning of a new generation, which would eventually lead to diverse cultures and civilizations.<p><b>Then Cain built a city</b><br>Cain's building of a city indicates a shift from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled, urban one. This development is significant in the context of early human civilization, as it represents the beginnings of organized society and culture. The construction of a city by Cain, a man marked by God for his sin, suggests the complexity of human progress intertwined with moral failure.<p><b>and named it after his son Enoch.</b><br>Naming the city after his son Enoch could reflect Cain's desire for legacy and permanence, despite his cursed status. It may also indicate an attempt to establish a new identity and future for his family line. This act of naming is a common biblical motif, seen in other instances where names carry prophetic or symbolic significance, such as Abram becoming Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>) or Jacob becoming Israel (<a href="/genesis/32-28.htm">Genesis 32:28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cain.htm">Cain</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Adam and Eve, known for committing the first murder by killing his brother Abel.

The straightforward wording shows marriage and intimacy as God-ordained, echoing <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>.<p>&#8226; Cain&#8217;s wife would have come from Adam&#8217;s immediate family line. <a href="/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4</a> notes Adam &#8220;had other sons and daughters,&#8221; making it reasonable that Cain married a sister or niece early in earth&#8217;s history when the gene pool was still unmarred by accumulated mutations (cf. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Cain was under judgment for Abel&#8217;s murder (<a href="/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11-12</a>), God did not revoke the creation mandate to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). Life and family continue, demonstrating the Lord&#8217;s commitment to His original design despite human sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she conceived and gave birth to Enoch</b><p>&#8226; The birth of Enoch signals the first&#8208;recorded grandchild of Adam and Eve, underscoring rapid population growth.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Enoch&#8221; means &#8220;dedicated&#8221; or &#8220;initiated,&#8221; hinting that Cain hoped his offspring would mark a new beginning after his own failure.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s kindness is on display: even the first murderer experiences family blessing (<a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>).<p>&#8226; This son is distinct from the later righteous Enoch who &#8220;walked with God&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/5-22.htm">Genesis 5:22-24</a>). Cain&#8217;s Enoch will father an entire urban lineage (<a href="/genesis/4-18.htm">Genesis 4:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Cain built a city</b><p>&#8226; Despite being sentenced to a life of wandering (<a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>), Cain establishes a settlement&#8212;a &#8220;city.&#8221; This may show partial repentance or, more likely, human determination to override divine discipline.<p>&#8226; The construction illustrates the swift advance of civilization: agriculture (<a href="/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>), music and metallurgy (<a href="/genesis/4-21.htm">Genesis 4:21-22</a>), and now urban planning. God allows culture to flourish even in a fallen world (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; A city also provides protection; Cain may have sought security against vengeance, though God had already marked him for safety (<a href="/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The account foreshadows later biblical tensions between city life characterized by human pride (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>; <a href="/bsb/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>) and God&#8217;s promised righteous city (<a href="/hebrews/11-10.htm">Hebrews 11:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and named it after his son Enoch</b><p>&#8226; Naming the city &#8220;Enoch&#8221; points to Cain&#8217;s desire for legacy. Rather than honor the Lord, he memorializes his own family line (cf. <a href="/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This act highlights the human impulse to find lasting significance through progeny and achievement apart from God, a theme revisited at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God will later redeem city life, culminating in the New Jerusalem where His name&#8212; not ours&#8212;marks the gates (<a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a> records that Cain, though judged, participates in marriage, fatherhood, and city building. The verse shows God&#8217;s ongoing grace in preserving family and fostering culture while also exposing humanity&#8217;s tendency to seek security and fame apart from Him. Cain&#8217;s actions anticipate both the blessings and the pitfalls of civilization, setting the stage for the Bible&#8217;s unfolding story of redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>CAIN AND HIS DESCENDANTS.</span><p>(17) <span class= "bld">Cain knew his wife.</span>--As Jehovah had told Eve that He would "greatly multiply her conception" (<a href="/genesis/3-16.htm" title="To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your sorrow and your conception; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.">Genesis 3:16</a>), we cannot doubt but that a numerous offspring had grown up in the 130 years that intervened between the birth of Cain and that of Seth, the <span class= "ital">substitute </span>for Abel. As a rule, only the eldest son is mentioned in the genealogies, and Abel's birth is chronicled chiefly because of his tragical end, leading to the enactment of the merciful law which followed and to the sundering of the human race. One of Adam's daughters apparently clave unto her brother, in spite of the solemn decree of banishment passed upon him, probably, by his father, and followed him in his wanderings as his wife, and bare him a son, whom they called "Enoch." Now this name, in Hebrew <span class= "ital">Chanoch, </span>is of the utmost importance in estimating Cain's character. It means <span class= "ital">train </span>in <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm" title="Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.">Proverbs 22:6</a> ("Train up a child"), but is used in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm" title="And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.">Deuteronomy 20:5</a> of the <span class= "ital">dedication </span>of a house; and thus Cain also calls his city "Enoch," <span class= "ital">dedicated. </span>But in old times the ideas of training and dedication were closely allied, because teaching generally took the form of initiation into sacred rites, and one so initiated was regarded as a consecrated person. Though, then, the wife may have had most to do with giving the name, yet we see in it a purpose that the child should be a trained and consecrated man; and Cain must have now put off those fierce and violent habits which had led him into so terrible a crime. We may add that this prepares our minds for the rapid advance of the Cainites in the arts of civilisation, and for the very remarkable step next taken by Cain.<p><span class= "bld">He builded a city.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">was building, </span>that is, <span class= "ital">began to build a city. </span>There was not as yet population enough for a city, but Cain, as his offspring increased, determined that they should dwell together, under <span class= "ital">training, </span>in some <span class= "ital">dedicated </span>common abode. He probably selected some fit spot for the acropolis, or citadel, to be the centre of his village; and as <span class= "ital">training </span>is probably the earlier, and <span class= "ital">dedication </span>the later meaning, Cain appears as a wise ruler, like Nimrod subsequently, rather than as a religious man. His purpose was much the same as that of the builders of the Tower of Babel, who wanted to keep mankind together that they might form a powerful community. It is worth notice that in the line of Seth, the name of the seventh and noblest of that race, is also Enoch, whose training was a close walk with God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - Domiciled in Nod, whither, impelled by woman's love, his wife had accompanied him, the unhappy fugitive began to seek, if not to find, relief from the gnawing agonies of remorse in the endearments of conjugal felicity and the occupations of secular industry. <span class="cmt_word">And Cain knew his wife.</span> Who must have been his sister, and married before the death of Abel, as "after that event it can scarcely be supposed, that any woman would be willing to connect herself with such a miserable fratricide" (Bush). Though afterwards forbidden, the tendency of Divine legislation on the subject of marriage being always in the direction of enlarging rather than restricting the circle of prohibited relationships, the union of brothers and sisters at the first was clearly indispensable, if the race was to multiply outwards from a common stock. "Even in much later times, and among very civilized nations, such alliances were not considered incestuous. The Athenian law made it compulsory to marry the sister if she had not found a husband at a certain age. Abraham married his half-sister, Sarah; and the legislator Moses himself was the offspring of-a matrimony which he later interdicted as unholy" (Kalisch). <span class="cmt_word">And she conceived</span>. For even from the unbelieving and unthankful, the disobedient and the repro. bate, God's providential mercies are not entirely withheld (<a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And bare Enoch.</span> <span class="accented">Chanoch</span>, "dedicated," "initiated," from <span class="accented">chanach</span>, to instruct (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>) and to consecrate (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>). Candlish detects in the name the impious pride of the first murderer; with more charity, Keil and Kalisch see a promise of the renovation of his life. The latter thinks that Cain called his son "Initiated" or "Instructed" to intimate that he intended to instruct him from his early years in the duties of virtue, and his city "<span class="accented">Dedicated"</span> to signify that he now recognized that "the firstling of his social prosperity belongs to God." If Luther's conjecture be correct, that the child received its name from its mother, it will touchingly express that young mother's hope that the child whom God had sent might be an augury of blessing for their saddened home, and her resolution both to consecrate him from his youth to God and to instruct him in God's fear and worship. <span class="cmt_word">And he builded</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was</span> <span class="accented">building</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> began to build, "but never finished, leading still a runagate life, and so often constrained to leave the work, as the giants did who built the tower of Babel" (Willet). <span class="cmt_word">A city</span>. Vater, Hartmann, and Bohlen discover in the city-building of Cain "a main proof of the mythical contents of the narrative," an advanced state of civilization "utterly unsuitable to so early a period;" but ancient tradition (Phoenician, Egyptian, and Hellenic) is unanimous in ascribing to the first men the invention of agriculture and the arts, with the discovery of metals, the origin of music, etc. (vide Havernick's 'Intro.,' &sect; 16). Of course the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> which Cain erected was not a city according to modern ideas, but a keep or fort, enclosed with a wall for the defense of those who dwelt within (Murphy). It was the first step in the direction of civilization, and Kalisch notes it as a deep trait in the Biblical account that the origin of cities is ascribed not to the nomad, but to the agriculturist. Impelled by the necessities of his occupation to have a fixed residence, he would likewise in course of time be constrained by the multiplication of his household to insure their protection and comfort. It is possible also that his attempt to found a city may have been dictated by a desire to bid defiance to the curse which doomed him to a wandering life; to create for his family and himself a new point of interest outside the holy circle of Eden, and to find an outlet for those energies and powers of which, as an early progenitor of the race, he must have been conscious, and in the restless activity of which oblivion for his misery could alone be found. If so, it explains the action which is next recorded of him, that <span class="cmt_word">he called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch</span>. <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he consecrated it to the realization of these his sinful hopes and schemes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/4-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Cain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(qa&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7014.htm">Strong's 7014: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cain -- a city in southern Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had relations with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
