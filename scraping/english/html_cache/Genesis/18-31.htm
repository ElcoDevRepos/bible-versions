In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, speaking directly to a deity was a rare and audacious act, indicating a special relationship. Abraham's approach is reminiscent of Moses' later intercessions for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of believers having direct access to God through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p><b>suppose twenty are found there?&#8221;</b><br>Abraham's negotiation with God reflects the ancient practice of bargaining, common in Middle Eastern cultures. The number twenty signifies a further reduction in Abraham's plea for mercy, demonstrating his deep concern for the righteous in Sodom. This intercession is a type of Christ's mediatory role, as Jesus intercedes for humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The focus on the righteous minority underscores the biblical theme of God's justice and mercy.<p><b>He answered, &#8220;On account of the twenty,</b><br>God's response reveals His willingness to spare the city for the sake of a few righteous individuals, emphasizing His mercy and justice. This principle is echoed in <a href="/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>, where God seeks someone to stand in the gap for the land. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of believers being the salt of the earth (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>), preserving and influencing the world through their presence.<p><b>I will not destroy it.&#8221;</b><br>God's assurance to Abraham highlights His character as both just and merciful. This promise reflects the biblical theme of divine patience and the opportunity for repentance, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>. The sparing of Sodom for the sake of the righteous parallels the ultimate salvation offered through Christ, who bore the judgment for sin so that believers might be spared (<a href="/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham.htm">Abraham</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, known for his faith and obedience to God.
