The right hand was typically used to confer the primary blessing upon the firstborn. Joseph, aware of this tradition, expected his father Jacob to place his right hand on Manasseh, the elder son. This act of placing the right hand on Ephraim, the younger, was unexpected and significant, indicating a divinely inspired choice that defied cultural norms. This moment echoes the theme of God choosing the younger over the elder, as seen with Isaac over Ishmael and Jacob over Esau.<p><b>he was displeased</b><br>Joseph's displeasure reflects his understanding of the cultural and familial expectations regarding birthright and blessing. His reaction underscores the human tendency to rely on tradition and expectation rather than divine guidance. This moment highlights the tension between human plans and God's sovereign will, a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>and took his father&#8217;s hand to move it from Ephraim&#8217;s head to Manasseh&#8217;s</b><br>Joseph's attempt to correct his father's action demonstrates his respect for the traditional order of blessing. However, it also reveals a lack of understanding of God's purpose in this situation. This act of trying to redirect the blessing parallels other biblical narratives where human intervention attempts to alter divine plans, such as Sarah's plan for Hagar to bear Abraham's child. It serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting in God's wisdom and timing.<p><b>from Ephraim&#8217;s head to Manasseh&#8217;s</b><br>The specific mention of Ephraim and Manasseh is significant in the broader biblical narrative. Ephraim, though the younger, would become the more prominent tribe in Israel, fulfilling Jacob's prophetic blessing. This reversal of expectations is a type of Christ, who often upends societal norms and expectations, choosing the humble and lowly to accomplish His purposes. The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh would later play crucial roles in the history of Israel, with Ephraim often representing the northern kingdom. This moment foreshadows the unexpected ways God works through history to fulfill His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The son of Jacob and Rachel, who became a powerful leader in Egypt.
