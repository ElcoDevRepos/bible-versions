This name change signifies a transformation and a covenant relationship with God, marking him as the patriarch of the twelve tribes of Israel. The reunion with Joseph, his beloved son whom he thought dead, is a pivotal moment in Jacob's life. Joseph, sold into slavery by his brothers, rose to power in Egypt, fulfilling God's providential plan. This meeting is a fulfillment of God's promise to preserve Jacob's lineage.<p><b>Finally I can die</b><br>This expression reflects Jacob's deep emotional relief and fulfillment. It echoes the sentiments of Simeon in <a href="/luke/2-29.htm">Luke 2:29-30</a>, who, upon seeing the infant Jesus, declared he could die in peace. Both instances highlight the fulfillment of long-awaited hopes and divine promises. Jacob's statement underscores the significance of family and the restoration of relationships, which are central themes in the biblical narrative.<p><b>now that I have seen your face</b><br>Seeing Joseph's face symbolizes the restoration of a broken relationship and the fulfillment of a long-held hope. In biblical times, seeing someone's face often represented personal presence and relational intimacy. This moment is a powerful testament to God's faithfulness in reuniting families and fulfilling His promises. It also prefigures the ultimate reconciliation and restoration found in Christ, who restores humanity's broken relationship with God.<p><b>and know that you are still alive!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miraculous nature of Joseph's survival and rise to power. It highlights God's sovereignty and providence in preserving Joseph's life for a greater purpose. Joseph's survival and success in Egypt were crucial for the preservation of the Israelite people during the famine. This moment foreshadows the resurrection of Christ, who was thought dead but is alive, bringing salvation and hope to all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel (Jacob)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Israelites, father of Joseph, who expresses profound relief and fulfillment upon seeing his son alive.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>Jacob's beloved son, who was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to become a powerful leader in Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where Joseph rose to power and where Jacob and his family moved during a time of famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reunion.htm">Reunion</a></b><br>The emotional meeting between Jacob and Joseph after many years of separation, highlighting themes of reconciliation and fulfillment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>The severe famine that affected the region, prompting Jacob's family to move to Egypt for survival.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_joy_of_reconciliation.htm">The Joy of Reconciliation</a></b><br>Jacob's joy upon seeing Joseph alive reminds us of the deep joy and peace that come from reconciliation with loved ones and with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_trials.htm">God's Faithfulness in Trials</a></b><br>Despite years of believing Joseph was dead, Jacob's faith is rewarded.

The aged patriarch has traveled to Egypt in obedience to God&#8217;s reassurance (<a href="/genesis/46-2.htm">Genesis 46:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment fulfills Joseph&#8217;s earlier announcement to his brothers that Jacob must come down (<a href="/genesis/45-9.htm">Genesis 45:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s words flow from a father&#8217;s heart reunited with a beloved son once thought dead (<a href="/genesis/42-36.htm">Genesis 42:36</a>; 45:26-28).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Finally I can die</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;Finally I can die&#8230;&#8221;

Jacob senses his life&#8217;s purpose&#8212;preserving the covenant line&#8212;is complete (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>; 48:21).<p>&#8226; Scripture often records saints expressing readiness once God&#8217;s promises are tangibly fulfilled (<a href="/genesis/15-15.htm">Genesis 15:15</a>;

(<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s assurance foreshadows Israel&#8217;s future preservation through the famine and beyond (<a href="/genesis/46-3.htm">Genesis 46:3-4</a>;
