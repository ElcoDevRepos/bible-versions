Jared, Mahalalel's son, is part of the line leading to Noah, which is significant for the preservation of humanity through the flood. The genealogies in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> serve to connect the creation narrative to the story of the flood, showing the continuity of God's plan through specific individuals. The naming of Jared, which means "descent" or "to come down," may reflect the spiritual or moral decline leading up to the flood, a theme that is developed further in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>.<p><b>Mahalalel lived 830 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in <a href="/genesis/5.htm">Genesis 5</a> are a subject of much discussion. They reflect the antediluvian (pre-flood) world, where conditions were believed to be different, possibly allowing for longer life. These extended lifespans also serve to bridge the gap between Adam and Noah, emphasizing the continuity of the human race and the unfolding of God's plan. Mahalalel's name means "praise of God," which may indicate the piety or the spiritual focus of his life, a contrast to the increasing wickedness of the world around him.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that the genealogies in Genesis are selective, focusing on the line leading to Noah and ultimately to Christ, rather than providing a complete record of all descendants. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the growth and expansion of the human family, fulfilling God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). It also implies that the earth was being populated by a diverse group of people, setting the stage for the events leading to the flood. This pattern of mentioning additional offspring is consistent throughout the genealogies, underscoring the idea that God's plan involves all of humanity, even as it focuses on specific individuals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kenan.htm">Kenan</a></b><br>A descendant of Adam, Kenan is part of the genealogy that leads to Noah.
