Eber is significant as the ancestor of the Hebrews, and his name is often associated with the term "Hebrew." This lineage highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Noah that the earth would be repopulated through his descendants. The genealogical record underscores the importance of family and heritage in biblical history, serving as a precursor to the nation of Israel.<p><b>Shelah lived 403 years</b><br>The long lifespans recorded in Genesis are characteristic of the antediluvian and early postdiluvian periods. These extended ages reflect a different environmental and biological context before the Flood and shortly thereafter. The longevity of Shelah and his contemporaries serves to bridge the gap between the pre-Flood world and the patriarchal narratives, maintaining continuity in the biblical record. This extended lifespan also allowed for the transmission of knowledge and traditions across generations, preserving the history and promises of God.<p><b>and had other sons and daughters</b><br>This phrase indicates that Shelah, like many of the patriarchs, had a large family. The mention of "other sons and daughters" suggests the growth and expansion of human populations following the Flood. It also implies that the biblical narrative focuses on specific individuals for theological reasons, rather than providing a comprehensive genealogical account. The emphasis on family and progeny reflects the cultural importance of lineage and inheritance in the ancient Near East, where family ties were crucial for social and economic stability.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shelah.htm">Shelah</a></b><br>A descendant of Shem, the son of Noah.

By noting his son Eber, Moses is tracking the ancestry of the people who will later be called &#8220;Hebrews&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/10-24.htm">Genesis 10:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-24.htm">1 Chronicles 1:24</a>; <a href="/luke/3-35.htm">Luke 3:35</a>).<p>&#8226; God is showing His faithful preservation of a specific family through which the promise of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> will unfold. Each name is a reminder that the Lord is guiding history, even after the scattering at Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple phrase &#8220;after he had become the father&#8221; signals a turning point: once the next key link is established, the narrative moves forward. Scripture often highlights one firstborn&#8212;or chosen&#8212;son while acknowledging others, underscoring God&#8217;s selective focus without denying the broader family (compare <a href="/genesis/5-3.htm">Genesis 5:3-32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shelah lived 403 years</b><p>&#8226; These long post-Flood lifespans are recorded as literal years, consistent with the ages of Shem (600), Arphaxad (438), and Peleg (239) in the same chapter. The gradual decline echoes God&#8217;s earlier word that human days would eventually shorten (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; see also <a href="/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The number points to God&#8217;s sustaining grace during a unique transitional era: Noah&#8217;s descendants are learning to fill the earth again (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>), yet they still enjoy residual longevity from pre-Flood conditions.<p>&#8226; The extra centuries allow ample overlap between generations, supporting oral transmission of God&#8217;s deeds from eyewitnesses like Shem all the way to Abram.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And had other sons and daughters</b><p>&#8226; Genealogies in Genesis frequently close a person&#8217;s entry with this phrase (<a href="/genesis/5-4.htm">Genesis 5:4, 7, 13, 19, 26</a>; 11:11). It affirms that the highlighted line is a deliberate selection, not the only offspring.<p>&#8226; By blessing Shelah with many children, God is fulfilling the original mandate to &#8220;be fruitful and multiply&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>). Each unnamed child represents families that spread across the earth, forming the nations listed in <a href="/bsb/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>.<p>&#8226; These additional sons and daughters remind us that every individual, even if not central to the main redemptive storyline, bears the image of God and contributes to His providential tapestry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/11-15.htm">Genesis 11:15</a> records three simple facts: Shelah fathered Eber, lived 403 more years, and had other children. Taken literally, the verse underscores God&#8217;s careful preservation of the messianic line, demonstrates His sustaining power in extended post-Flood lifespans, and celebrates the ongoing multiplication of humanity. In one sentence the Spirit weaves purpose, longevity, and fruitfulness&#8212;assuring us that the Lord of history attends to every generation while advancing His promise toward its ultimate fulfillment in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/11-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he had become the father of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct &#124;
