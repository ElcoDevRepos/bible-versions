This phrase refers to the completion of Leah's bridal week. The cultural practice was to honor the bride with a full week of festivities, which underscores the importance of marriage in the community. This period was a time of joy and feasting, reflecting the communal nature of marriage. The completion of this week was necessary before any further marital arrangements could be made.<p><b>and we will give you the younger one</b><br>Laban's promise to give Rachel, the younger daughter, to Jacob highlights the cultural significance of birth order and marriage customs. Typically, the elder daughter would marry first, but Laban's deception led to Leah's marriage to Jacob. This phrase indicates Laban's willingness to fulfill Jacob's original desire to marry Rachel, albeit under manipulated circumstances. The mention of "the younger one" also foreshadows the ongoing theme of sibling rivalry and favoritism, which is prevalent throughout Genesis.<p><b>in return for another seven years of work.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the concept of servitude and labor as a form of dowry or bride price, which was common in ancient times. Jacob's agreement to work another seven years for Rachel demonstrates his deep love and commitment to her. The number seven is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. This additional period of service also reflects the broader biblical theme of patience and perseverance in the face of trials. Jacob's experience can be seen as a type of Christ, who also endured suffering and labor for the sake of His bride, the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The grandson of Abraham, son of Isaac, and brother of Esau.

Appeased, therefore, by the promise of Rachel as soon as the seven days are over, Jacob, rather than quarrel with the whole family, submits to the wrong.
