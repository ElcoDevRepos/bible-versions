This reflects a cautious and strategic approach to ensure favor with the Egyptian official, who is unknown to them as Joseph. The doubling of the silver signifies an attempt to rectify any perceived wrongdoing and to demonstrate integrity. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, gifts were often used to appease or gain favor with powerful figures, as seen in other biblical accounts such as when Jacob sent gifts to Esau in <a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-21</a>.<p><b>so that you may return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks.</b><br>The silver being returned is significant because it was originally found in their sacks after their first trip to Egypt, causing fear and confusion among the brothers (<a href="/genesis/42-27.htm">Genesis 42:27-28</a>). This act of returning the silver is an attempt to clear any suspicion of theft or dishonesty. It also highlights the brothers' growing sense of responsibility and honesty, contrasting with their earlier deceitful actions against Joseph. The act of returning the silver can be seen as a step towards reconciliation and redemption.<p><b>Perhaps it was a mistake.</b><br>Jacob's suggestion that the return of the silver might have been a mistake indicates a hope for a peaceful resolution. It reflects a cautious optimism and a desire to believe in the possibility of an innocent explanation. This phrase also underscores the uncertainty and tension in the narrative, as the brothers are unaware of Joseph's true identity and intentions. The idea of a mistake introduces the theme of divine providence, as God is orchestrating events beyond their understanding, ultimately leading to the fulfillment of Joseph's dreams and the preservation of Jacob's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the family, father of Joseph and his brothers.
