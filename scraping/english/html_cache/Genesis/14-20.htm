The title "God Most High" (El Elyon) emphasizes God's ultimate authority and power. This is the first time this title is used in the Bible, highlighting the recognition of God's supreme position by Melchizedek, a priest-king. The use of this title connects to other scriptures where God is acknowledged as the Most High, such as in <a href="/psalms/7-17.htm">Psalm 7:17</a> and <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a>, reinforcing the idea of God's unmatched dominion.<p><b>who has delivered your enemies into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This statement attributes Abram's victory to divine intervention rather than human effort. It underscores the belief that God actively participates in the affairs of His people, granting them success against their adversaries. This theme of God delivering enemies is recurrent in the Bible, seen in stories like the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and David's victories (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). It reflects the covenant relationship where God promises protection and victory to those who are faithful to Him.<p><b>Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything.</b><br>Abram's act of giving a tenth, or tithe, to Melchizedek is significant as it represents an acknowledgment of Melchizedek's priestly authority and a gesture of gratitude to God. This is the first recorded instance of tithing in the Bible, setting a precedent for later practices in Israelite worship (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-32</a>). The act of tithing here also prefigures the Levitical priesthood and the support of religious leaders. Melchizedek is seen as a type of Christ, as noted in <a href="/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where Jesus is described as a priest in the order of Melchizedek, emphasizing His eternal priesthood and the superiority of His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Abram is blessed by Melchizedek and responds by giving a tithe.
