This act of kindness is reminiscent of other biblical instances where hospitality is shown to strangers, such as Abraham's reception of the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. It also foreshadows the New Testament teachings on hospitality, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which encourages believers to show hospitality to strangers.
