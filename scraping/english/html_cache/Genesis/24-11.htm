This time of day was cooler, making it more comfortable for labor. Biblically, evening often symbolizes a time of transition or preparation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-5.htm">Genesis 1:5</a>, where evening marks the beginning of a new day.<p><b>he made the camels kneel down</b><br>Camels were valuable assets in ancient times, used for long journeys due to their endurance and ability to carry heavy loads. The act of making camels kneel indicates preparation for rest and unloading. This gesture also reflects the servant's anticipation of a significant encounter, as camels kneeling is a sign of readiness and submission, paralleling the servant's mission to find a wife for Isaac.<p><b>near the well outside the town</b><br>Wells were central to community life, serving as gathering places and essential sources of water. This particular well, outside the town, suggests a common meeting place for travelers and locals.

This daily routine provided opportunities for social interaction and community building. The timing of the servant's arrival aligns with divine providence, setting the stage for Rebekah's introduction. This moment foreshadows other significant biblical encounters at wells, such as Jacob meeting Rachel in <a href="/genesis/29-9.htm">Genesis 29:9-10</a>, highlighting God's orchestration in the lives of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham's_servant.htm">Abraham's Servant</a></b><br>The unnamed servant, traditionally believed to be Eliezer, is tasked with finding a wife for Isaac.

"About great cities men often carry, water, both on donkeys and on their own backs; but in the country, among the unsophisticated natives, women only go to the well or the fountain; and often, when traveling, have I seen long files of them going and returning with their pitchers "at the time when women go out to draw water" (Thomson, 'Land and Book,' p. 592). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/24-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As evening approached,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6153.htm">Strong's 6153: </a> </span><span class="str2">Evening</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he made the camels</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;mal&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
