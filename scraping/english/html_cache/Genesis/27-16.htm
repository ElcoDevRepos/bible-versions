The use of goat skins is significant, as it highlights the lengths to which Rebekah and Jacob are willing to go to deceive Isaac. The skins are used to mimic Esau's hairy hands, as described earlier in <a href="/genesis/25-25.htm">Genesis 25:25</a>. This act of deception is a pivotal moment in the narrative, showcasing the theme of deceit and its consequences, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. The use of animal skins also foreshadows the sacrificial system that will be established later in the Mosaic Law, where goats and other animals are used for atonement.<p><b>and on the smooth part of his neck.</b><br>The smoothness of Jacob's skin is contrasted with Esau's hairiness, emphasizing the physical differences between the two brothers. This detail is crucial for the deception to succeed, as Isaac relies on touch due to his failing eyesight. The neck is a vulnerable and intimate part of the body, symbolizing the closeness and trust that is being violated in this act of deception. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where the innocent (Jacob, in this case) takes on the appearance of another to receive a blessing. However, unlike Christ, who takes on humanity's sin to bring salvation, Jacob's deception brings about familial strife and division. This act also connects to the broader biblical theme of the younger sibling receiving the blessing, as seen with Joseph and David, pointing to God's sovereignty and the unexpected ways He fulfills His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebekah.htm">Rebekah</a></b><br>The wife of Isaac and mother of Esau and Jacob.
