The context is post-destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, where Lot and his daughters are isolated in a cave. The daughters' plan to intoxicate their father highlights the lack of faith and trust in God's provision. Wine, often used in biblical times for celebration and ritual, here becomes a tool for manipulation. This act contrasts with biblical teachings on honoring one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) and the dangers of drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>).<p><b>so we can sleep with him</b><br>The daughters' intention to sleep with their father is a direct violation of the moral and ethical laws later codified in <a href="/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-18</a>, which prohibits incestuous relationships. This act is driven by fear and a misunderstanding of God's promises, as they believe they are the last humans on earth. The cultural context of the time placed a high value on lineage and offspring, which may have influenced their drastic decision. This incident foreshadows the complex relationships and moral failures that will continue to challenge the descendants of Lot.<p><b>and preserve his line.&#8221;</b><br>The desire to preserve their father's line underscores the importance of family lineage in ancient Near Eastern culture. The daughters' actions, though misguided, reflect a concern for legacy and continuity, which were significant in biblical narratives. This event leads to the birth of Moab and Ben-Ammi, ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites, respectively. These nations later become adversaries of Israel, illustrating how human actions can have long-lasting consequences. The preservation of lineage is a recurring theme in Scripture, ultimately pointing to the genealogy of Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promise of a Savior through the line of Abraham (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/lot.htm">Lot</a></b><br>Nephew of Abraham, who settled in Sodom.

Yet the narrative also showcases God&#8217;s sovereignty: despite the incestuous origin of Moab and Ammon, He wove redemption through Ruth and ultimately Christ.

Their proposal was revolting and unnatural in the extreme. By subsequent Mosaic legislation a transgression of such enormity was rendered punishable by death. Even in the present instance the perpetrators were not wholly unconscious of the wickedness of their conduct. The fact that they required a stratagem for the attainment of their purpose shows that at least they could not calculate on their father's approbation. The entire story has been regarded as the invention of later Jewish hatred to the Moabites and Ammonites (De Wette), a conjecture believed by some to be " not improbable (Rosenm&uuml;ller); but if so, how should the same writer exhibit Abraham (<a href="/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a>) as filled with compassionate tenderness towards the cities of the plain?
