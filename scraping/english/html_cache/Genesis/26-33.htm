The name "Shibah" is derived from the Hebrew word for "oath" or "seven," symbolizing the oath made between Isaac and Abimelech, the king of the Philistines. This reflects the peace treaty and mutual recognition of God's blessing upon Isaac. The act of naming wells was a common practice in ancient times, often signifying ownership, divine encounters, or significant events. This well, like others in the patriarchal narratives, represents God's provision and faithfulness.<p><b>and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba</b><br>Beersheba, meaning "Well of the Oath" or "Well of Seven," becomes a significant location in biblical history. It marks the southern boundary of the Promised Land, often mentioned in the phrase "from Dan to Beersheba," indicating the extent of Israel's territory. Beersheba is a place of covenant and divine encounter, as seen in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and later Jacob. Archaeological evidence supports its historical significance, with findings of ancient wells and settlements. The continuity of the name "to this day" underscores the lasting impact of God's promises and the enduring legacy of the patriarchs in the land of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaac.htm">Isaac</a></b><br>The son of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac is a patriarch of Israel.
