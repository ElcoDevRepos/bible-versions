The specification of "seven pairs" indicates the importance of these animals for both sacrificial purposes and the continuation of species post-flood. This prefigures the sacrificial system established in the Mosaic Law and highlights the importance of purity and holiness. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting the sufficiency of God's provision.<p><b>a male and its mate</b><br>The mention of "a male and its mate" underscores the importance of preserving the ability to reproduce and repopulate the earth after the flood. This reflects God's design for creation, emphasizing the complementary roles of male and female in the animal kingdom, which is also mirrored in the creation of humanity (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p><b>a pair of every kind of unclean animal</b><br>"Unclean animals" are those not suitable for sacrifice or consumption according to later Jewish dietary laws. The inclusion of these animals ensures the preservation of all species, reflecting God's care for all creation. This distinction between clean and unclean animals is further elaborated in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a>, and it foreshadows the dietary laws given to Israel.<p><b>a male and its mate</b><br>Reiterating the phrase emphasizes the necessity of both genders for the continuation of each species. This mirrors the creation narrative where God created living creatures according to their kinds (<a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24-25</a>).

Clean animals will soon be needed for burnt offerings (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) and, after the Flood, for food (<a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Seven pairs (fourteen animals) preserve genetic strength and allow for immediate sacrifice without endangering survival.<p>&#8226; The odd number &#8220;seven&#8221; may echo the created order of a seven-day week (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>), underscoring divine completeness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a male and its mate</b><p>Each pair consists of complementary sexes. <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27-28</a> established that life multiplies through &#8220;male and female.&#8221; Noah&#8217;s cargo mirrors Eden, keeping God&#8217;s design for procreation intact.

While not suited for sacrifice or immediate consumption, they are still vital to the post-Flood world&#8217;s balance (<a href="/genesis/8-17.htm">Genesis 8:17</a>). <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Deuteronomy 14</a> later labels some animals unclean for dietary reasons, yet <a href="/acts/10-12.htm">Acts 10:12-15</a> reveals that God can shift such boundaries when His redemptive plan requires.

The verse teaches obedience, respect for God&#8217;s distinctions, and confidence that every detail of His word is purposeful and reliable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Of every clean beast</span>--<span class= "bld">Heb., <span class= "ital">of all clean cattle</span>--thou shalt take to thee by</span> <span class= "bld">sevens</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">seven seven.</span>--This probably does not mean <span class= "ital">seven pairs </span>of each, though many commentators so interpret it, but seven of each kind. If, however, <span class= "ital">seven pairs </span>be the right interpretation, but few species could have been included, as to attend properly to so large a number of animals would have been beyond the power of Noah and his sons. But which were the clean beasts? There can be no reference here to the Levitical law, which had respect to human food; nor to animals tamed and untamed, as all alike are called cattle; but probably the clean cattle were such as from the days of Adam 'and Abel had been offered in sacrifice. Thus provision was made for Noah's sacrifice on his egress from the ark, and also for his possession of a small herd of such animals as would be most useful to him amid the desolation which must have existed for a long time after the flood. The clean beasts would therefore be oxen, sheep, goats; the unclean, camels, horses, asses, and such other animals as stood in some relation to man. Of birds, the dove would especially be clean.<p>It has been pointed out that these more full and specific orders are given in the name of Jehovah, whereas most of the narrative of the flood is Elohistic, and hence it has been assumed that some Jehovist narrator added to and completed the earlier narrative. These additions would be <a href="/context/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1-6</a>. the last clause of <a href="/genesis/7-16.htm" title="And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.">Genesis 7:16</a>, Noah's sacrifice in <a href="/context/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20-22</a>, and the cursing of Canaan in <a href="/context/genesis/9-18.htm" title="And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.">Genesis 9:18-27</a>. Now, it is remarkable that the sacrifice is as integral a portion of the <span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis </span>as the sending forth of the birds (<span class= "ital">Chaldean Genesis, </span>p. 286), and is thus indubitably older than the time of Moses. Still, there is nothing improbable in Moses having two records of the flood before him, and while the division of Genesis into Elohistic and Jehovistic portions usually breaks down, there is a <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>appearance of the combination of two narratives in the present history, or, at least, in this one section (<a href="/context/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1-6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of every clean beast</span>. That the distinction between clean and unclean animals was at this time understood is easier to believe than that the writer would perpetrate the glaring anachronism of introducing in prediluvian times what only took its rise several centuries later (Kalisch). That this distinction was founded on nature, "every tribe of mankind being able to distinguish between the sheep and the hyena, the dove and the vulture" ('Speaker's Commentary'), or "on an immediate conscious feeling of the human spirit, not yet clouded by any ungodly and unnatural culture, which leads it to see in many beasts pictures of sin and corruption" (Keil), has been supposed; but with greater probability it was of Divine institution, with reference to the necessities of sacrifice (Ainsworth, Bush, Wordsworth; cf. <a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>). To this was appended in the Levitical system a distinction between clean and unclean in respect of man's food (<a href="/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou take</span> - inconsistent with <a href="/genesis/6-20.htm">Genesis 6:20</a>, which says the animals were to come to Noah (Colenso); but <a href="/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>, which says that Noah was to bring them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> make them go (at least nearly equivalent to take), clearly recognizes Noah's agency (Quarry) - <span class="cmt_word">to thee by sevens.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">seven, seven</span>; either seven <span class="accented">pairs</span> (Vulgate, LXX., Aben Ezra, Clericus, Michaells, De Wette, Knobel, Kalisch, Murphy, Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary'), or seven individuals (Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, Calvin, Pererius, Wiliet, Delitzsch, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil, Lange, Bush); both parties quoting the next clause in support of their particular interpretation. Davidson, Colenso, and Kalisch challenge both interpretations as "irreconcilable with the preceding narrative" (<a href="/genesis/6-19.htm">Genesis 6:19</a>); but the obvious answer is, that while in the first communication, which was given 120 years before, when minute instructions were not required, it is simply stated that the animals should be preserved by pairs; in the second, when the ark was finished and the animals were about to be collected, it is added that, in the case of the few clean beasts used for sacrifice, an exception should be made to the general rule, and not one pair, but either three pairs with one over, or seven pairs, should be preserved. <span class="cmt_word">The male and his female</span>. This seems to be most in favor of the first interpretation, that pairs, and not individuals, are meant. <span class="cmt_word">And of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.</span> <span class="accented">Ish veishto</span>. Cf. <a href="/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>, where the phrase denotes the ethical personality of human beings, to which there is here an approximation, as the preserved animals were designed to be the parents of subsequent races.
