It highlights the importance of Joseph's position in Egypt, as his family is granted an audience with the king. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be influential in foreign lands (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;We have come to live in the land for a time,</b><br>The temporary nature of their stay is emphasized here.

This phrase also foreshadows the eventual Exodus, where the Israelites would leave Egypt to return to the Promised Land.<p><b>because there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants,</b><br>This highlights the severity of the famine affecting Canaan, which forced Jacob's family to seek sustenance in Egypt.

This distinction would later contribute to the Israelites' separation and identity as a distinct people.<p><b>since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe.</b><br>The famine is a pivotal event in the narrative, driving the migration to Egypt. It serves as a backdrop for God's providential care, as He uses the famine to bring Jacob's family to Egypt, setting the stage for their growth into a great nation. This also connects to Joseph's earlier dreams and his role in God's plan (<a href="/genesis/41-25.htm">Genesis 41:25-32</a>).<p><b>So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.&#8221;</b><br>Goshen is identified as a fertile region in Egypt, suitable for grazing livestock.
