Assyria is a significant region in biblical history, known for its powerful empire that later becomes a major adversary of Israel. The movement into Assyria suggests the expansion of Nimrod's influence and the spread of early post-flood civilization. Assyria's later prominence in biblical prophecy and history, particularly in relation to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, underscores its importance.<p><b>where he built Nineveh</b><br>Nineveh is one of the most ancient and significant cities in the Bible, later becoming the capital of the Assyrian Empire. It is famously known as the city to which the prophet Jonah was sent to preach repentance. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed Nineveh's historical existence and grandeur, with its ruins located near modern-day Mosul in Iraq. Nineveh's eventual destruction, as prophesied by Nahum, serves as a testament to God's judgment against wickedness.<p><b>Rehoboth-Ir</b><br>The exact location of Rehoboth-Ir is uncertain, but it is mentioned as one of the cities built by Nimrod. The name means "broad places" or "wide streets," suggesting a city of considerable size or importance. This city, along with others mentioned, indicates the urbanization and development occurring in the post-flood world, reflecting humanity's growth and organization.<p><b>Calah</b><br>Calah, also known as Nimrud, was another significant city in ancient Assyria. It became one of the major cities of the Assyrian Empire, known for its impressive palaces and temples. Archaeological excavations have uncovered substantial remains, providing insight into Assyrian culture and power. Calah's mention alongside Nineveh highlights the early establishment of key urban centers that would play crucial roles in the region's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A significant ancient Mesopotamian kingdom and empire, known for its powerful military and advanced civilization.

Taking the verse literally, we see a real man, Nimrod, leaving a real region.<p>&#8226; &#8220;He went forth&#8221; signals purposeful expansion. Genesis presents early post-Flood history as a time of rapid migration, just as God had commanded mankind to &#8220;fill the earth&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/9-1.htm">Genesis 9:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The territory he reaches is Assyria. Later Scripture will treat Assyria as a major world power (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17</a>), but here we are given its humble origins: one pioneering leader obeying the divine impulse to spread out.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: compare the later movement of Abraham from Ur to Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-5</a>). Both journeys underscore God&#8217;s sovereign direction of peoples and places.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he built Nineveh</b><p>&#8226; Nimrod does not merely travel; he &#8220;built.&#8221; The verb underlines his reputation as a &#8220;mighty hunter before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>) who channels strength into city-building.<p>&#8226; Nineveh will loom large throughout the Old Testament: Jonah is sent there to preach repentance (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1-2</a>; 3:1-4), and Nahum prophesies its downfall (<a href="/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; 3:7). Here we witness its literal founding.<p>&#8226; By recording Nineveh&#8217;s beginnings so early, Scripture reminds us that even the greatest future enemies start under God&#8217;s watchful eye. As <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> affirms, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD; He turns it wherever He wishes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Bullet points of later significance:<p>&#8211; Capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (<a href="/2_kings/19-36.htm">2 Kings 19:36</a>).<p>&#8211; Site of massive repentance in Jonah&#8217;s day (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>).<p>&#8211; Example of judgment after refusing lasting reform (<a href="/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rehoboth-Ir</b><p>&#8226; Literally &#8220;Rehoboth City,&#8221; this settlement is listed only here and in <a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11-12</a>. Its obscurity highlights that God values recording even the lesser-known threads of His plan.<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;Rehoboth&#8221; (&#8220;broad places&#8221;) hints at spacious expansion, fitting Nimrod&#8217;s pattern of large urban centers.<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a> records Isaac naming a well &#8220;Rehoboth,&#8221; saying, &#8220;Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land&#8221;. Both usages stress God-given room to grow.<p>&#8226; Though Rehoboth-Ir fades from later history, its inclusion testifies that no city appears by accident; every habitation exists under God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Calah</b><p>&#8226; Calah (later known as Nimrud) becomes another cornerstone city in Assyria. <a href="/genesis/10-12.htm">Genesis 10:12</a> pairs it with Nineveh and Resen, calling the complex &#8220;the great city,&#8221; suggesting a tri-city conglomerate.<p>&#8226; Archaeologists have uncovered monumental palaces and reliefs at Nimrud, confirming the Bible&#8217;s straightforward statement that this was a significant urban hub.<p>&#8226; Calah&#8217;s mention alongside Nineveh foreshadows the political and military might that will surge from this region, ultimately challenging Israel (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; 17:3).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> shows God later raising up Assyria as &#8220;the rod of My anger,&#8221; proving that the same Lord who watched Calah&#8217;s founding also wields its empire for His redemptive purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a> records Nimrod&#8217;s literal expansion from Shinar into Assyria, where he plants four real cities&#8212;Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah (with Resen added in verse 12). Each name anchors future biblical narratives, demonstrating that God both authors history&#8217;s beginnings and guides its outcomes. By tracing one man&#8217;s journey and brick-laying, the verse affirms that every movement of peoples, every founding of a city, and every rise of an empire unfolds under the sovereign, purposeful hand of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11, 12) <span class= "bld">Out of that land went forth Asshur.</span>--So the LXX., Syriac, and Vulg.; but the Targum and most modern authorities rightly translate, "Out of that land he went forth into Assyria." We have here nothing to do with Asshur the son of Shem (see <a href="/genesis/10-22.htm" title="The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.">Genesis 10:22</a>), but are occupied with Nimrod and the Hamites, who, after firmly establishing themselves in Babylonia, subsequently extended their influence northward. This is confirmed by the cuneiform inscriptions, which prove that the southern portion of Mesopotamia was the chief seat of the Accadians, while in Assyria they came at an early date into collision with the Shemites, who drove them back, and ultimately subjugated them everywhere. It is not necessary to suppose that this spread of Hamite civilisation northward was the work of Nimrod personally; if done by his successors, it would, in Biblical language, be ascribed to its prime mover.<p>The Assyrian cities were:--<p><span class= "bld">1.

Canon Rawlinson places it at Selamiyah (<span class= "ital">Anc. Mon., </span>1:204), a large village half-way between Nineveh and Calah. As the vast ruins scattered throughout Mesopotamia are those of Assyrian buildings, Resen, though "a great city" in Hamite times, might easily pass into oblivion, if never rebuilt by the conquerors.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of that land went forth Asshur, the son of Shem</span> (ver. 22; LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, Luther, Calvin, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Bohlen). <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the early Assyrians retired from Babylon before their Cushite. invaders, and, proceeding northward, founded the cities after mentioned; but the marginal rendering seems preferable: "Out of that land went (Nimrod) into Asshur," or Assyria, the country northeast of Babylon, through which flows the Tigris, and which had already received its name from the son of Shem (the Targums, Drusius, Bochart, Le Clerc, De Wette, Delitzsch, Keil, Kalisch, Lange, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">alii</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And builded Nineveh</span>.
