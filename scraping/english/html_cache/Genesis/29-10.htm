Rachel, being the daughter of Laban, connects Jacob to his mother's family, fulfilling Rebekah's wish for Jacob to find a wife from her own kin (<a href="/genesis/27-43.htm">Genesis 27:43-45</a>). This encounter is significant as it sets the stage for the future of the Israelite nation, with Rachel becoming one of the matriarchs. The familial connection emphasizes the importance of kinship and covenant relationships in biblical narratives.<p><b>with Laban&#8217;s sheep</b><br>Shepherding was a common occupation in ancient Near Eastern cultures, and it was often the responsibility of women to tend to the flocks, as seen with Rachel. This detail highlights the pastoral lifestyle of the patriarchs and the significance of livestock as a measure of wealth and prosperity. The mention of Laban's sheep also foreshadows the future conflicts and negotiations between Jacob and Laban over livestock (<a href="/genesis/30-25.htm">Genesis 30:25-43</a>).<p><b>he went up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well</b><br>Wells were vital community resources in the arid regions of the Near East, often covered with large stones to protect the water supply. Jacob's action of rolling the stone away demonstrates his strength and eagerness to assist Rachel, possibly indicating his immediate affection for her. This act of service can be seen as a type of Christ, who removes obstacles and provides living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>).<p><b>and watered his uncle&#8217;s sheep</b><br>Jacob's willingness to water Laban's sheep reflects his character as a servant and foreshadows his future role as a shepherd for Laban's flocks. This act of kindness and diligence is reminiscent of the servant-hearted nature of Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). It also prefigures the care and leadership Jacob will later provide for his own family and possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the twin brother of Esau.

Every phrase highlights initiative, strength, and humble care&#8212;qualities God still calls His people to display as they trust His providence and act in loving service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Laban his mother's brother.</span>--The threefold repetition of these words has no other reason than that given in the Note on <a href="/genesis/28-5.htm" title="And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram to Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.">Genesis 28:5</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother</span>, - "the term mother's brother is not unintentionally repeated three times in this verse to describe with the greatest possible stress that Jacob had met with his own relations, with "his bone and his flesh" (Kalisch) - <span class="cmt_word">and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother</span> (Jacob from the first takes particular notice of Laban's flock, perhaps regarding them as a sign of Laban s wealth. If Laban s daughter had her attractions for the son of Isaac, so also had Laban s sheep), <span class="cmt_word">that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth</span> (probably disregarding the shepherds' rule to wait for the gathering of all the flocks, unless, indeed, Rachel s was the last), <span class="cmt_word">and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</span> The threefold repetition of this phrase does not prove that Jacob acted in all this purely as a cousin (Lange). The phrase is the historian's, and Jacob had not yet informed Rachel of his name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/29-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
