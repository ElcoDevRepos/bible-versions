In the biblical context, Hagar is in the wilderness, desperate and without hope. The opening of her eyes signifies a moment of spiritual awakening and divine provision. This act of God is reminiscent of other instances in Scripture where God provides clarity or revelation, such as when Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the chariots of fire (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). It underscores the theme of God's care and provision for those in distress.<p><b>and she saw a well of water</b><br>The well of water represents God's provision and sustenance. In the arid wilderness, water is a symbol of life and survival. Wells are significant in biblical narratives, often marking places of divine encounter and covenant, such as with Isaac at Beersheba (<a href="/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23-25</a>). This well is a literal source of life for Hagar and Ishmael, but it also symbolizes spiritual sustenance and God's faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>So she went and filled the skin with water</b><br>Hagar's action of filling the skin with water demonstrates obedience and initiative following divine revelation. It reflects a common biblical theme where human action follows divine provision, as seen in the gathering of manna by the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4-5</a>). The skin, a common container for water in ancient times, highlights the practical aspects of survival in the wilderness and the importance of resourcefulness.<p><b>and gave the boy a drink</b><br>This act of giving Ishmael a drink is a fulfillment of maternal care and responsibility. It signifies the immediate relief and sustenance provided by God through Hagar's actions. In a broader biblical context, it echoes the nurturing and life-giving role of mothers, as well as God's provision for future generations. Ishmael, as a descendant of Abraham, is part of God's promise to make Abraham a father of many nations (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>), and this moment ensures the continuation of that promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hagar.htm">Hagar</a></b><br>An Egyptian servant of Sarah, mother of Ishmael.

The phrase &#8220;God opened her eyes&#8221; shows that the Lord takes the initiative when human vision fails, just as He did for Elisha&#8217;s servant (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>) and the disciples on the Emmaus road (<a href="/luke/24-31.htm">Luke 24:31</a>).<p>- The text is literal: God acts in real time and space, intervening to preserve life. His faithfulness to His earlier promise about Ishmael (<a href="/genesis/21-13.htm">Genesis 21:13, 18</a>) is on full display.<p>- When Scripture speaks of God opening eyes, it underscores our dependence on divine revelation. We can&#8217;t see salvation or provision until He graciously lifts the veil (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>; <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and she saw a well of water</b><p>- The well was already present; Hagar simply could not perceive it. God does not always create new resources&#8212;often He reveals what He has already provided (<a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>; <a href="/numbers/21-16.htm">Numbers 21:16</a>).<p>- Water is the most basic element of survival in the desert, and here it becomes a tangible sign of God&#8217;s covenant care. It echoes other moments when the Lord supplies water to sustain His people (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15&#8211;16</a>) and prefigures the living water offered by Christ (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<p>- The scene reminds us that divine provision may sit right beside us, unseen until the Lord opens our eyes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So she went and filled the skin with water</b><p>- Hagar responds immediately. God&#8217;s provision never negates human responsibility; it invites obedient action.<p>- Notice the practical sequence: see, act, receive. Similar patterns appear with the widow gathering vessels for oil (<a href="/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1&#8211;7</a>) and the disciples distributing the multiplied loaves (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>).<p>- The skin is a small container, yet it becomes the conduit of God&#8217;s life-saving supply. He often uses simple, available means (<a href="/judges/7-8.htm">Judges 7:8</a>; <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave the boy a drink</b><p>- Ishmael&#8217;s future hinges on this moment. By quenching his thirst, God preserves the line that will become a great nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p>- A mother&#8217;s caregiving action mirrors God&#8217;s own compassion, fulfilling His promise in real time.<p>- Sharing water reflects God&#8217;s heart for practical mercy (<a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). The rescue is not only physical but covenantal: God&#8217;s word to Hagar and Abraham stands firm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/21-19.htm">Genesis 21:19</a> records a literal, historical rescue that showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness, provision, and compassion. When Hagar&#8217;s resources and vision fail, the Lord opens her eyes, reveals the well He has already supplied, invites her active participation, and preserves Ishmael for the fulfillment of His promise. The passage calls readers to trust God&#8217;s unseen provisions, act in obedient faith, and recognize His unwavering commitment to His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">A well of water.</span>--Not a cistern, but a spring of living water. The mirage in the desert so wearies the traveller, that at last he turns in despair from what may be more truthful signs. But after her outburst of grief, Hagar would grow more calm, and, encouraged by the angel's voice, she renews her search, and finds. As Abravanel notices, the well already existed, and was not created for Hagar's use; for God, it is said, opened her eyes, that is, enabled her to see something that indicated the existence of water: trees probably rising round the spring, or some vegetable upgrowth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God opened her eyes</span>.
