It signifies obedience to God's call in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>. Abram's journey is a physical manifestation of faith, as he leaves behind his homeland and family to follow God's direction. This act of traveling through the land is symbolic of the Christian journey of faith, trusting in God's promises even when the destination is not fully known.<p><b>as far as the site of the Oak of Moreh</b><br>The Oak of Moreh is a significant landmark in the ancient Near East, often associated with places of worship or divine revelation. In the context of Abram's journey, it represents a place where God might reveal Himself or His will. The oak, or terebinth tree, was a common site for Canaanite religious practices, indicating that Abram was entering a land with established pagan traditions. This sets the stage for the contrast between the worship of the one true God and the idolatry of the Canaanites.<p><b>at Shechem</b><br>Shechem is one of the oldest and most important cities in the biblical narrative, located in the central hill country of Canaan. It later becomes a city of refuge and a Levitical city. Shechem is significant as a place where God reaffirms His covenant with Abram's descendants (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>, <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>). It is also where Jacob's well is located, which Jesus visits in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises through Christ.<p><b>And at that time the Canaanites were in the land</b><br>This phrase highlights the presence of the Canaanites, the original inhabitants of the land promised to Abram. The Canaanites were known for their idolatrous practices, which were in direct opposition to the worship of Yahweh. Their presence in the land underscores the challenges Abram and his descendants would face in claiming God's promise. It also foreshadows the future conflicts between the Israelites and the Canaanite nations, as well as the eventual fulfillment of God's promise to give the land to Abram's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram</a></b><br>Later known as Abraham, he is a central figure in the Bible, called by God to leave his homeland and journey to a land that God would show him.

Abram&#8217;s trek through Canaan, his pause at the Oak of Moreh, his arrival in central Shechem, and the mention of resident Canaanites all weave together to show a faithful God staking His claim through a faithful servant. Each phrase ties geography to promise, revealing that when God speaks, even ordinary trees and occupied territories become testimonies that His word is sure and His plan unstoppable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/genesis/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The place of Sichern.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">Shechem. </span>This word signifies "shoulder," and was the name of the ridge uniting Mounts Ebal and Gerizim, the summits of which are about two miles apart. As the name is thus taken from the natural conformation of the ground, it may be very ancient. The modern name of the place is Nablous, a contraction of Flavia Neapolis, a title given it in honour of Vespasian. Mr. Conder ( <span class= "ital">Tent Work in Palestine, </span>1:61) describes the valley as an oasis of remarkable beauty and luxuriance, but set, like Damascus, in a desert, and girt around by strong and barren mountains.<p><span class= "bld">The plain of Moreh.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">the oak of Moreh, </span>It was here that Jacob buried the strange gods brought by his household from Haran (<a href="/genesis/35-4.htm" title="And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.">Genesis 35:4</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and here, too, Joshua set up the stone of testimony (<a href="/joshua/24-26.htm" title="And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.">Joshua 24:26</a>; <a href="/judges/9-6.htm" title="And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.">Judges 9:6</a>); but as in <a href="/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> the oaks (wrongly translated in most places in our version "plains") are described in the plural, it is probable that the word is to be taken as a collective for an oak grove. Such shady spots were favourite places for the tents of the wandering patriarchs. A famous terebinth, called after Abram's name, long existed at Mamre, and under it, in the time of Vespasian, the captive Jews were sold for slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the site of Abram's grove. The Hebrew word, however, for terebinth is <span class= "ital">elah, </span>while that used here is <span class= "ital">elon. </span>It was probably the <span class= "ital">quercus pseudococcifera </span>(see Tristram, <span class= "ital">Nat.

Probably in this cool grove some religious personage had given instruction to the people. In <a href="/judges/7-1.htm" title="Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.">Judges 7:1</a> we find a place called the "teacher's hill," and it is thus possible that among a people so religious as the race of Shem, men from time to time arose revered by the people as teachers of holiness.
