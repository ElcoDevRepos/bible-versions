This favoritism is a recurring theme in Genesis, as seen in the relationships between Isaac and Ishmael, and Jacob and Esau. Jealousy among siblings is a common human experience, but here it foreshadows the future conflict and suffering Joseph will endure. This jealousy is a catalyst for the events that lead to Joseph's eventual rise to power in Egypt, which is part of God's sovereign plan to preserve the family of Israel during a future famine.<p><b>but his father kept in mind what he had said</b><br>Jacob, also known as Israel, reflects on Joseph's dreams, which suggest that Joseph will have a position of authority over his family. This phrase indicates that Jacob, despite his initial rebuke of Joseph, recognizes the potential significance of the dreams. This is reminiscent of Mary, the mother of Jesus, who "treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart" (<a href="/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>) regarding the prophecies about Jesus. Jacob's contemplation suggests an awareness of God's hand in the unfolding events, even if he does not fully understand them. This foreshadows the eventual fulfillment of Joseph's dreams when his brothers bow to him in Egypt, illustrating God's providential plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who received a special coat and had dreams that suggested his future prominence over his family.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>The father of Joseph and his brothers, who showed favoritism towards Joseph, causing tension within the family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_brothers.htm">Joseph's Brothers</a></b><br>The sons of Jacob who were envious of Joseph due to their father's favoritism and Joseph's dreams.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where Jacob and his family were living at the time of these events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph's_dreams.htm">Joseph's Dreams</a></b><br>Prophetic dreams that indicated Joseph's future rise to a position of authority, which fueled his brothers' jealousy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_jealousy.htm">The Dangers of Jealousy</a></b><br>Jealousy can lead to destructive actions and broken relationships, as seen in the animosity between Joseph and his brothers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/parental_wisdom.htm">Parental Wisdom</a></b><br>Jacob's decision to keep the matter in mind suggests the importance of parental discernment and reflection on family dynamics.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite human failings and jealousy, God's plans prevail, as seen in Joseph's eventual rise to power and the preservation of his family.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/favoritism's_consequences.htm">Favoritism's Consequences</a></b><br>Favoritism can breed resentment and division within families, highlighting the need for fairness and love towards all children.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflective_pondering.htm">Reflective Pondering</a></b><br>Like Jacob, we should take time to ponder and seek God's wisdom in understanding the events and dreams in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Genesis_37_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Genesis 37:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Prevent_jealousy_like_Joseph_s_brothers.htm">How can we guard against jealousy like Joseph's brothers in Genesis 37:11?
