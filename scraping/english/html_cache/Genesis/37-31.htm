This garment becomes a focal point of his brothers' jealousy and resentment. The act of taking the robe signifies their intent to strip Joseph of his favored position. This robe is a tangible representation of Jacob's love, and its removal marks the beginning of Joseph's trials. The robe also foreshadows the stripping of Jesus' garments before His crucifixion, highlighting themes of betrayal and suffering.<p><b>slaughtered a young goat</b><br>The slaughtering of a young goat is significant in the biblical narrative. Goats were commonly used in sacrificial practices, and their blood was often associated with atonement and deception. This act of slaughtering a goat for deceitful purposes contrasts with the later use of goat blood in the Day of Atonement rituals (Leviticus 16). The use of a goat here also echoes the deception Jacob himself perpetrated on his father Isaac, using goat skins to mimic Esau's hairy arms (Genesis 27). This cyclical theme of deception within the family highlights the consequences of sin and deceit.<p><b>and dipped the robe in its blood</b><br>Dipping the robe in blood is a deliberate act to deceive their father, Jacob, into believing that Joseph has been killed by a wild animal. Blood in the Bible often symbolizes life and death, covenant, and sacrifice. This act of deception is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for Joseph's journey to Egypt and eventual rise to power. The imagery of blood-stained garments is later mirrored in <a href="/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>, where Christ is described as wearing a robe dipped in blood, symbolizing His righteous judgment and victory.
