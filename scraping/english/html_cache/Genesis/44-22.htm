The term "my lord" indicates the authority and power Joseph held as the governor of Egypt. This interaction occurs during a time of famine, where Joseph's brothers have come to Egypt to buy grain. The use of "my lord" is consistent with the cultural norms of the time, where individuals of lower status would address those in authority with deference.<p><b>&#8216;The boy cannot leave his father.</b><br>"The boy" refers to Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob and the only full brother of Joseph. Benjamin's significance is heightened by the fact that he is the last remaining son of Jacob's beloved wife, Rachel. The brothers' statement underscores the deep bond between Jacob and Benjamin, as well as Jacob's protective nature over him. This familial relationship is central to the narrative, as it sets the stage for Joseph's testing of his brothers' integrity and repentance. The inability to leave his father highlights the emotional and relational dynamics within Jacob's family.<p><b>If he were to leave,</b><br>This conditional phrase introduces the potential consequences of Benjamin leaving his father. It reflects the brothers' understanding of the gravity of the situation and the potential impact on their father, Jacob. The conditional nature of the statement also serves to emphasize the seriousness of the request and the potential for tragedy if it is not heeded.<p><b>his father would die.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase indicates the depth of Jacob's attachment to Benjamin, suggesting that any separation could lead to Jacob's death from grief. This reflects the cultural and historical context where family bonds were paramount, and the loss of a child could be devastating. The statement also foreshadows the emotional climax of the narrative, where Joseph's identity is revealed, and the family is ultimately reconciled. The potential for Jacob's death underscores the stakes involved in the brothers' journey and the importance of family unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- One of Jacob's sons, who speaks on behalf of his brothers to Joseph, expressing the deep bond between Jacob and Benjamin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamin.htm">Benjamin</a></b><br>- The youngest son of Jacob, deeply loved by his father, Jacob, and a central figure in the brothers' plea to Joseph.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob (Israel)</a></b><br>- The father of the twelve tribes of Israel, who is deeply attached to Benjamin after losing Joseph.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>- The governor of Egypt, who is testing his brothers' integrity and repentance by demanding Benjamin's presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>- The land where Joseph has risen to power and where the brothers have come to buy grain during the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_parental_love.htm">The Depth of Parental Love</a></b><br>Jacob's love for Benjamin is a powerful example of the deep, protective love a parent has for their child.

The repetition stresses their honesty and the gravity of the situation.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the scene foreshadows our own appeal before a greater Lord; we come acknowledging His supremacy, just as the brothers do with Joseph (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The boy cannot leave his father</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The boy&#8221; refers to Benjamin, though he is a grown man; the language reflects Jacob&#8217;s tender affection (<a href="/genesis/43-8.htm">Genesis 43:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Benjamin is Jacob&#8217;s last link to Rachel after Joseph&#8217;s apparent death (<a href="/genesis/35-18.htm">Genesis 35:18&#8211;20</a>; 42:38).<p>&#8226; The family bond illustrates how God designed the family as a covenant unit meant for protection and nurture (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; On a broader scale, it highlights the irreplaceable relationship between Father and Son, prefiguring the unique bond between God the Father and Jesus the Son (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If he were to leave</b><p>&#8226; The brothers are not exaggerating; Jacob&#8217;s grief over Joseph had nearly destroyed him (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Their conditional statement underscores the risk they now face: Benjamin&#8217;s absence could trigger irreversible sorrow.<p>&#8226; This moment tests the brothers&#8217; repentance; years earlier they willingly sent Joseph away, but now they fight to keep Benjamin close. Their change fulfills Joseph&#8217;s earlier dreams of family restoration (<a href="/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, it&#8217;s a call to guard what is precious to the Father&#8212;first our relationship with His Son, then the unity of His people (<a href="/john/17-11.htm">John 17:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His father would die</b><p>&#8226; Jacob&#8217;s life is bound up in Benjamin&#8217;s (<a href="/genesis/44-30.htm">Genesis 44:30&#8211;31</a>). Physical death is possible, but the text also reflects crushing emotional despair.<p>&#8226; The clause shows the weight of sin&#8217;s earlier consequences: the brothers&#8217; deception about Joseph almost &#8220;killed&#8221; their father; repeating the trauma would be intolerable (<a href="/genesis/42-38.htm">Genesis 42:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s appeal points to substitutionary love; in the very next verses he offers himself in Benjamin&#8217;s place (<a href="/genesis/44-33.htm">Genesis 44:33</a>). This foreshadows Christ, who bore our penalty so the Father might bring many sons to glory (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God honors such sacrificial love, turning potential death into reunion and life (<a href="/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/44-22.htm">Genesis 44:22</a> conveys the brothers&#8217; desperate plea: Benjamin must remain with Jacob or the aged father will die of grief. The verse highlights (1) respect for authority, (2) the strength of covenant family bonds, (3) the danger of repeating past sins, and (4) love willing to sacrifice self for another. In the unfolding narrative, it sets the stage for Judah&#8217;s self-offering, Joseph&#8217;s revelation, and ultimately God&#8217;s redemptive plan that points to the sacrificial love of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/genesis/44-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So we said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wan&#183;n&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
