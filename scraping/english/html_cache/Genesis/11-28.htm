In ancient Near Eastern culture, it was considered a tragedy for a child to die before their parent, as it disrupted the expected generational order. This detail sets the stage for understanding the family dynamics and the subsequent migration of Terah's family. It also emphasizes the sorrow and loss experienced by Terah, which may have influenced his later decisions.<p><b>Haran died</b><br>Haran's death is significant as it impacts the family structure and future events. Haran was the father of Lot, who later plays a crucial role in the narrative of Genesis, particularly in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Haran's death leaves Lot without a father, which may explain why Lot accompanies Abram (later Abraham) when he leaves Ur. This event foreshadows the importance of family ties and responsibilities in the unfolding biblical narrative.<p><b>in his native land</b><br>The mention of Haran's native land underscores the connection to his birthplace and cultural roots. This detail is important for understanding the identity and heritage of Terah's family. It also highlights the significance of land and place in the biblical narrative, as the land often represents more than just a physical location; it is tied to identity, promise, and divine purpose.<p><b>in Ur of the Chaldeans</b><br>Ur of the Chaldeans is identified as Haran's birthplace and the starting point of Abram's journey. Ur was a prominent city in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its advanced civilization and polytheistic worship, particularly of the moon god, Nanna. The reference to the Chaldeans connects the narrative to a specific historical and geographical context, providing insight into the cultural and religious environment from which Abram was called by God. This setting contrasts with the monotheistic faith that Abram would come to embody, highlighting the transformative journey from a land of idolatry to a land of promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haran.htm">Haran</a></b><br>The son of Terah and brother of Abram (later Abraham) and Nahor.

Abram's call to leave Ur symbolizes a call to leave behind idolatry and follow the one true God. We are similarly called to forsake anything that takes God's rightful place in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_legacy.htm">The Importance of Legacy</a></b><br>Haran's death reminds us of the brevity of life and the importance of the legacy we leave.

When first we read of this city, it was inhabited by a population of Accadians, a Turanian race, sprang probably from an early offshoot of the family of Japheth; but in course of time it was conquered by men of the Semitic family, who from thence overran the whole of Shinar, or Babylonia, and expelled from it the descendants of Cush. Mr. Sayce (<span class= "ital">Chald. Gen. </span>p. 20) puts this conquest at some very uncertain date, two or three thousand years before Christ; but the establishment of a powerful monarchy under a king named Lig-Bagas, and the consolidation under his sway of several petty kingdoms, into which Chaldea had been previously split up, he places with some confidence at 3,000 years before the Christian era (<span class= "ital">ibid., </span>p. 24). Now, there are in our museums inscribed bricks and engraved cylinders actually from the library of Lig-Bagas, and we learn that the Accadian literature was still older; for many of the works found at Agane are translations from it: and thus all those difficulties as to the antiquity of the art of syllabic writing which used to exist when men had nothing better to judge by than Egyptian picture-writing have passed away. Abraham migrated from a town which was then a famous seat of learning, and where even the ordinary transactions of life were recorded on tablets of terra-cotta. Very probably, therefore, he carried with him bricks and cylinders inscribed with these ancient records. We are no longer, therefore, surprised at the striking similarity between the narratives in the Book of Genesis prior to the migration of Abraham and those preserved in the cuneiform inscriptions. But the believer in inspiration cannot fail to be struck also at their dissimilarity. The cuneiform inscriptions are polytheistic, acknowledging twelve superior gods, and of gods inferior a countless multitude. The Semitic race is accused of adding to these a number of goddesses, chief among whom were Beltis, the wife of Bel, and Istar, the planet Venus. Of all this there is no trace in the Biblical records; nor is there in the whole Chaldean literature anything so grand and Divine as the thoughts expressed in the opening words of Genesis: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."<p>As Ur is an Accadian word, we must reject all Semitic interpretations of its meaning; we must further add that Mr. Rawlinson gives reasons for believing that its early importance was due to its being a great maritime emporium (<span class= "ital">Anc. Mon., </span>i. 27). It was, we read, a walled town, and the great port for the commerce of the Persian Gulf, while round it lay a marvellously rich country, said to be the original home of the wheat-plant, and famous for its dates and other fruits. Its being called Ur-Casdim, "Ur of the Chaldees," shows that they had already won it from the Accadians when Terah dwelt there. Its subsequent name, Mugheir, probably means "mother of bitumen"--that is, producer of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Haran died before his father</span>.
