Jacob's death and burial are pivotal moments, as Jacob was a patriarch whose life and actions were foundational to the history of Israel. The burial took place in the cave of Machpelah, a site purchased by Abraham (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19-20</a>), which underscores the importance of the Promised Land. This act of burial signifies the fulfillment of Jacob's request to be laid to rest with his ancestors, highlighting the continuity of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>he returned to Egypt</b><br>Joseph's return to Egypt signifies his continued role and responsibilities as a leader in a foreign land. Egypt, at this time, was a place of refuge and provision for Jacob's family during the famine, yet it also foreshadows the eventual enslavement of the Israelites. Joseph's return indicates his commitment to his duties in Egypt, where he had risen to power under Pharaoh. This return also sets the stage for the eventual Exodus, as foretold to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>.<p><b>with his brothers</b><br>Joseph's brothers accompany him back to Egypt, reflecting the unity and reconciliation that had been achieved within the family. This unity is significant given their earlier betrayal of Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-18.htm">Genesis 37:18-28</a>). The brothers' presence also emphasizes the collective responsibility and shared heritage of the sons of Israel, who would become the twelve tribes. Their return to Egypt is a reminder of the temporary nature of their stay in the land of Canaan, as they await the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>and all who had gone with him to bury his father</b><br>This phrase includes the entourage that accompanied Joseph, which likely consisted of Egyptian officials and servants, as well as members of Jacob's household. The presence of Egyptians highlights Joseph's high status and the respect he commanded in Egypt. It also illustrates the cultural and political connections between Egypt and the family of Israel at this time. The large group signifies the importance of the burial and the honor given to Jacob, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise to make Jacob's descendants a great nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The favored son of Jacob, who rose to power in Egypt.
