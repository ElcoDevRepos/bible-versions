Daybreak symbolizes a new beginning or revelation. In the context of Genesis, it marks the start of a crucial moment in Joseph's dealings with his brothers. Biblically, daybreak is a time of divine intervention or new opportunities, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, where joy comes in the morning.<p><b>the men were sent on their way</b><br>This phrase indicates a transition and a test. Joseph's brothers are unknowingly part of a larger plan orchestrated by Joseph to test their integrity and repentance. The act of sending them away mirrors earlier biblical narratives where individuals are sent on journeys that lead to significant spiritual or personal growth, such as Abraham's journey in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>.<p><b>with their donkeys</b><br>Donkeys were common pack animals in ancient Near Eastern cultures, used for transportation and carrying goods. Their mention here emphasizes the normalcy and routine of the brothers' departure, contrasting with the extraordinary events that are about to unfold.

The special form of divination here referred to (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or divining out of cups) was practiced by the ancient Egyptians (Hengstenberg's 'Egypt and the Books of Moses,' p. 39). "Small pieces of gold or silver, together with precious stones, marked with strange figures and signs, were thrown into the vessel; after which certain incantations were pronounced, and the evil demon was invoked; the latter was then supposed to give the answer either by intelligible words, or by pointing to some of the characters on the precious stones, or in some other more mysterious manner. Sometimes the goblet was filled with pure water, upon which the sun was allowed to play; and the figures which were thus formed, or which a lively imagination fancied it saw, were interpreted as the desired omen" (Kalisch). Traces of this ancient practice of soothsaying have been detected by some writers in the magnificent vase of turquoise belonging to Jam-shoed, the Solomon of Persia. Like Merlin's cup, described by Spenser ('Faery Queens,' 3:2, 19) - <p><span class="accented">"It vertue had to show in perfect sight<br />Whatever thing was in the world contained<br />Betwixt the lowest earth and heven's hight,<br />So that it to the looker appertaynd."</span> A similar account is given by Homer of the cup of Nestor; and Alexander the Great is reported to have possessed a mystic goblet of a like kind. It is said that in the storming of Seringapatam the unfortunate Tippeo Saib retired to gaze on his divining cup, and that after standing awhile absorbed in it he returned to the fight and fell (vide Kitto's 'Cyclopedia,' art.
