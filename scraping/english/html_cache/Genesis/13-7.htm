The discord signifies the challenges of cohabitation when resources become limited. This situation foreshadows future separations and conflicts within families in the biblical narrative. The herdsmen's quarrel reflects the broader theme of human conflict over resources, a recurring issue throughout history. This discord also sets the stage for Abram's later demonstration of faith and generosity when he allows Lot to choose his land first, showcasing a model of conflict resolution.<p><b>At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.</b><br>The mention of the Canaanites and Perizzites provides historical and cultural context, indicating that Abram and Lot were not the only inhabitants of the land. The Canaanites were a significant group in the region, known for their advanced cities and culture, while the Perizzites were likely a smaller, rural group. Their presence underscores the challenges Abram and Lot faced in finding suitable land for their flocks amidst established populations. This detail also foreshadows the future interactions and conflicts between the descendants of Abram and the Canaanite peoples, as seen in later biblical narratives. The presence of these groups highlights the theme of God's promise to Abram regarding the land, which would eventually be fulfilled through his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abram.htm">Abram (Abraham)</a></b><br>The patriarch of the Hebrew people, chosen by God to be the father of many nations.

As the Canaanites devoted their main strength to a maritime life and trade, they would not attempt to extirpate these natives, but would be content with driving them into the interior. As thus some districts would be occupied by the dominant Canaanites, and others by these aborigines, two such large clans as those of Abram and Lot would find it difficult to discover unoccupied land enough to provide pasture for their cattle.
