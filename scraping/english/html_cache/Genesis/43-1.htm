Famines were not uncommon in the ancient Near East due to the region's dependence on seasonal rains. In the context of Genesis, this famine is part of God's providential plan to bring Jacob's family to Egypt, setting the stage for the events leading to the Exodus. Famines are also seen in other parts of the Bible, such as during the time of Elijah (1 Kings 17) and in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>).<p><b>was still severe</b><br>The severity of the famine emphasizes the dire circumstances faced by Jacob's family and the surrounding nations. This ongoing hardship underscores the need for Joseph's brothers to return to Egypt for more grain, furthering the narrative of reconciliation and fulfillment of Joseph's dreams. The persistence of the famine also highlights the theme of testing and reliance on God's provision, as seen in other biblical accounts where God's people are tested through prolonged trials.<p><b>in the land</b><br>The "land" refers to Canaan, where Jacob and his family resided. Canaan was a region that relied heavily on agriculture, making it vulnerable to the effects of famine. This geographical context is crucial, as it contrasts with Egypt, where the Nile River provided a more stable water source, allowing for surplus grain storage. The land of Canaan is significant throughout the Bible as the Promised Land, a place of both blessing and testing for God's people. The famine in Canaan serves as a backdrop for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan through Joseph, a type of Christ, who provides salvation and sustenance to his family and the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/famine.htm">Famine</a></b><br>A severe shortage of food affecting the land of Canaan and surrounding regions.
