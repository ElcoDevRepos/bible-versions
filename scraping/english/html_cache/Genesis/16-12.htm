The "wild donkey" is an animal known for its independence and untamed spirit, often found in the desert regions of the Near East. This imagery suggests that Ishmael and his descendants would lead a nomadic and free-spirited life, not easily subjected to others. The wild donkey's habitat in the wilderness also reflects Ishmael's future dwelling in the desert areas, aligning with the Bedouin lifestyle of many Arab tribes. This description foreshadows the independent and sometimes contentious nature of the Arab peoples historically linked to Ishmael.<p><b>and his hand will be against everyone</b><br>This part of the prophecy indicates a life of conflict and struggle. Ishmael's descendants would often find themselves in opposition to others, engaging in disputes and warfare. This reflects the historical tensions and conflicts in the Middle East, where Ishmael's lineage is traditionally traced. The phrase suggests a life marked by strife and resistance, both in personal and broader social contexts.<p><b>and everyone&#8217;s hand against him</b><br>This phrase complements the previous one, highlighting mutual hostility. Ishmael's descendants would not only initiate conflict but also be recipients of aggression from others. This mutual antagonism can be seen in the historical interactions between the descendants of Ishmael and other groups, including the Israelites. The prophecy underscores a life of ongoing conflict, where Ishmael's lineage would be both aggressors and defenders.<p><b>he will live in hostility toward all his brothers</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the familial and tribal conflicts that would characterize Ishmael's descendants. "Brothers" here can refer to both immediate family and extended kin, including the Israelites, descendants of Isaac. The historical enmity between the Israelites and various Arab tribes is well-documented in the Bible and other historical records. This prophecy highlights the enduring nature of these conflicts, which have persisted through centuries. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the consequences of human actions and decisions, as seen in the story of Abraham, Sarah, and Hagar.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ishmael.htm">Ishmael</a></b><br>The son of Abram (Abraham) and Hagar, Sarai's Egyptian maidservant.
