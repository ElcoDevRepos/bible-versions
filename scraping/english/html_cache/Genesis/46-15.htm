Paddan-aram, located in the region of Mesopotamia, is significant as the place where Jacob fled to escape his brother Esau's wrath and where he worked for Laban. Leah bore Jacob six sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. These sons became the heads of six of the twelve tribes of Israel, playing crucial roles in the history and development of the nation. The mention of Paddan-aram highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous, as Jacob's family began to grow significantly in this region.<p><b>in addition to his daughter Dinah</b><br>Dinah is the only daughter of Jacob mentioned by name in the Bible. Her story is notably recounted in <a href="/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>, where she is involved in an incident with Shechem, a Hivite prince. This event led to significant conflict and violence, as her brothers Simeon and Levi took revenge on the city of Shechem. Dinah's inclusion here emphasizes the completeness of Leah's offspring and highlights the importance of women in biblical narratives, even when they are not as prominently featured as their male counterparts.<p><b>The total number of sons and daughters was thirty-three</b><br>This number includes Leah's six sons, her daughter Dinah, and their descendants. The count of thirty-three may seem complex, as it involves not only direct offspring but also grandchildren and possibly great-grandchildren. This enumeration underscores the rapid growth of Jacob's family, which is a testament to God's blessing and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. The number thirty-three is symbolic in biblical numerology, often associated with a complete or perfect period, reflecting the completeness of Leah's contribution to Jacob's lineage. This growth is a precursor to the formation of the nation of Israel, which would later emerge from these tribes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leah.htm">Leah</a></b><br>The first wife of Jacob, Leah was given to Jacob through Laban's deception.

Scripture presents them as real men whose tribes will shape Israel&#8217;s future (<a href="/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31&#8211;35</a>; 30:17&#8211;20; 35:23). By naming them again here, God reminds readers that He works through ordinary families to fulfill His covenant promises, just as He foretold to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; 17:6) and later confirmed through Moses (<a href="/exodus/1-1.htm">Exodus 1:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>born to Jacob in Paddan-aram</b><p>Every one of Leah&#8217;s sons was conceived while Jacob lived in Aram, far from Canaan (<a href="/genesis/28-2.htm">Genesis 28:2</a>; 28:5; 31:18). Their birthplace underlines two truths:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plan is not confined to geographic borders; His covenant blessing followed Jacob wherever he went (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>; 31:13).<p>&#8226; The journey back to Canaan with this large family showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to bring His people home, foreshadowing later returns from exile (<a href="/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in addition to his daughter Dinah</b><p>Dinah&#8217;s inclusion confirms her importance in the family line, despite ancient cultures often overlooking daughters. Her earlier story (<a href="/bsb/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>) had national implications, showing how individual choices influence an entire clan. By mentioning her alongside her brothers, the text affirms that God sees every member of the covenant family (<a href="/psalms/68-6.htm">Psalm 68:6</a>; <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The total number of sons and daughters was thirty-three</b><p>The tally underscores that this is a literal headcount, bridging the patriarchs to the budding nation that will soon enter Egypt.

Stephen echoes it to stress God&#8217;s unfolding plan (<a href="/acts/7-14.htm">Acts 7:14</a>). Counting every person highlights divine precision: not one promise-bearing life is forgotten (<a href="/isaiah/40-26.htm">Isaiah 40:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/genesis/46-15.htm">Genesis 46:15</a> records real people in a real place for a real purpose.
